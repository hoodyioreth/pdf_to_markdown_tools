The creature must immediately make a Constitution saving throw after casting the addition concentration spell to maintain their active concentration. The DC equals 10 + the combined level of each spell that the creature is attempting to concentrate on. -- On a success, the creature maintains their concentration on any current spells, as well as the one they just cast. -- On a failure, the creature loses concentration on all their spells, and takes psychic damage equal to the saving throw DC. As long as the creature is concentrating on more than one spell, they must use their action to repeat the saving throw at the beginning of each of their turns.

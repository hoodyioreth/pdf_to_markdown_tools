# Beyond our fragile realms lie the Fading Lands, where the Oerth intersects the  Planes.

# Some possess a strange allure to the adventurous, like the Isle of the Ape or the Court

# of Rings, where the Fey cavort and dance. Others are places of dread and woe, such

# as the Reaping Halls of Scythingfane or the infernal wasteland that cradles the Blood

# Obelisk of the Aerdy—a shameful monument to an unspeakable act of wickedness.

# The Flanaess is replete with such sites of mystery, their tales too

# vast to recount in a single lifetime. Fortunately, I will soon have

# the benefit of many lifetimes.

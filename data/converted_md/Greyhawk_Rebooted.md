Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 4 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Preface I n 1972, after seeing a demonstration of Dave Arneson’s Castle Blackmoor game, Gary Gygax agreed with Arneson to co-develop a set of rules for a game that would eventually become known as Dungeons & Dragons. Gygax liked the idea of a castle and dungeon that players could explore, and created his own imaginary place called Castle Greyhawk, which he used to test and develop the game. With almost continuous play during the years 1972–1975, Gygax, and later his co-Dungeon Master (co-DM), Rob Kuntz, expanded the setting to include an entire world. After the creation of TSR, publication of D&D and the release of several adventures set in his world of Greyhawk, Gygax was surprised to learn that there was strong player demand for access to his fantasy setting. He agreed to publish a campaign setting based on his home campaign. Gygax serialized a fantasy novella called The Gnome Cache in the ﬁrst seven issues of TSR’s house magazine, The Dragon. This was where fans ﬁrst learned that Greyhawk was located on a planet called Oerth, which was similar in many ways to our own planet but was populated by strange creatures and wielders of magic. In this way, D&D differed from the settings of Lord of the Rings and Robert E. Howard’s Conan stories, which actually took place on Earth. TSR intended to publish The World of Greyhawk early in 1979; the foreword by editor Allen Hammack was dated February 1979. Gygax himself assured Dragon readers in issue No. 37 that, barring catastrophe, the World of Greyhawk was ready for ofﬁcial release. However, Gygax’s The World of Greyhawk (TSR 9025) did not hit store shelves until August 1980. (I was 11 years old at the time!) The World of Greyhawk consisted of a thirty-two page folio (this edition is often called the “World of Greyhawk folio” to distinguish it from later editions) and a 34” x 44” (86 cm x 112 cm) two-piece colour map of the Flanaess, by Darlene Pekul. The book came with a folder containing maps and a gazetteer describing every state and region on the maps. In addition to details of geography, history, and political states mentioned above, Gygax also included a complete ﬁctional calendar including days  of the weeks, months and festivals, Preface 5 notes on scale and movement, so the DM could keep track of how long it would take the players to move from region to region, royal and noble precedence, so the DM could ensure the players addressed heads of state properly Orders of knighthood, for players who desired to join one, a glossary of runes and glyphs that the DM could use to create puzzling messages, mysterious omens and vaguely worded portents. The ﬁrst edition covers less than a quarter of the landmass of Oerth, concentrating on the eastern part of the continent of Oerik, giving only the most basic descriptions of each state; DMs were expected to elaborate on these areas in order to make them an integral part of their own individual campaigns. Three years later, TSR released the World of Greyhawk box set, which included all of the material from the earlier release, as well as information taken from articles that had been published in Dragon, brand new material, and more maps. Publication of the World of Greyhawk was the ﬁrst step in Gygax’s vision for Oerth. Over the next few years, he planned to unveil other areas of the continent of Oerik, giving each new area the same in- depth treatment of history, geography, and politics as had been accorded the Flanaess. By the time the 1983 edition was published, Gygax was in Hollywood on a semi-permanent basis, approving scripts for the Saturday morning Dungeons & Dragons cartoon series and trying to land a deal for a D&D movie. Without his day- to-day guidance, many of these projects never appeared. Because he was occupied with getting a movie off the ground in Hollywood, Gygax had to leave the day-to-day operations of TSR to Kevin and Brian Blume. In 1984, after months of negotiation, he reached an agreement with Orson Welles to star in a D&D movie, and John Boorman to act as producer and director. But almost at the same time, he received word that back in Lake Geneva, TSR had run into severe ﬁnancial difﬁculties and Kevin Blume was shopping the company for US$6 million. Gygax immediately discarded his movie ambitions—his D&D movie would never be made—and ﬂew back to Lake Geneva. There, he discovered to his shock that although industry leader TSR was grossing US$30 million, it was barely breaking even; it was in fact US$1.5 million in debt and teetering on the edge of insolvency. After investigating the reasons why, Gygax brought his ﬁndings to the ﬁve other company directors. Gygax claimed that the ﬁnancial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, over-stafﬁng, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects. Gygax demanded that Kevin Blume be removed as company president, and the three outside directors agreed with him. However, the board still believed the Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 6 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. ﬁnancial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to stay in control, in March 1985, Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and rather than selling the company, he took steps to produce new revenue generating products. To that end, he contacted Dave Arneson with a view to produce some Blackmoor material. He also bet heavily on a new AD&D book, Unearthed Arcana, a compilation of material culled from Dragon Magazine articles. He also quickly wrote a novel set in his Greyhawk setting, Saga of Old City, featuring a protagonist called Gord the Rogue. In order to bring some ﬁnancial stability to TSR, he hired Lorraine Williams as company manager. When Unearthed Arcana was released in July, Gygax’s bet paid off, as the new book sold 90,000 copies in the ﬁrst month. His novel also sold well, and he immediately published a sequel, Artifact of Evil. The ﬁnancial crisis had been averted, but ironically Gygax had paved the way for his own downfall. In October 1985, the new manager, Lorraine Williams, revealed that she had purchased all of the shares of Kevin and Brian Blume—after Brian had triggered his own 700-share option. Williams was now the majority shareholder, and replaced Gygax as president and CEO. She also made it clear that Gygax would be making no further creative contributions to TSR. Several of his projects were immediately shelved and never published. Gygax took TSR to court in a bid to block the Blumes’ sale of their shares to Williams, but he lost. Sales of D&D reached $29 million in 1985, but Gygax but by they end of the year, Gygax was forced out of TSR Inc. By the terms of his settlement with TSR, Gygax kept the rights to Gord the Rogue as well as all D&D characters whose names were anagrams or plays on his own name (for example, Yrag and Zagyg), however, he lost the rights to all his other work, including the World of Greyhawk and the names of all the characters he had ever used in TSR material, such as Mordenkainen, Robilar, and Tenser. Preface 7 After Gygax was forced out of TSR at the end of 1985 many subsequent works by TSR, and later Wizards of the Coast, updated or modiﬁed the original information. The most signiﬁcant of these included:

❉The 1988 hard cover book Greyhawk Adventures

❉The 1992 boxed set From the Ashes

❉The 1998 Greyhawk: The Adventure Begins

❉The 2000 Living Greyhawk Gazetteer According to an online Q & A with Gygax in 2007, TSR’s stewardship turned Greyhawk into something very different from what he had envisioned. A considerable amount of content was created after Gygax left TSR as can be seen by the list above.  Major, world-changing events like the giant invasions of Sterich and Geoff;  The Greyhawk Wars including Iuz’s dominance of many nations which leads to the actual disappearance of some;  The changing of a mad King into an actual undead; the Islamiﬁcation of the Baklunish people; the insinuation of the Scarlet Brotherhood into... well everything; the list goes on. Many loved these changes. Many other did not. There is no right or wrong on that issue.  That said, this PDF is intended mainly for those of the latter category but more speciﬁcally, those who like the old school feel of Greyhawk without the extensive meta-plot but also want to  play using the expanded options and styles that 5e allows that 1e did not. Dungeons & Dragons 5e & The World of Greyhawk tm Dungeons & Dragonstm has gone through a number of iterations over the years from the original booklets through the Basic and Expert sets to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons in 1977.  AD&D was later re- released with a second edition in 1989 with some fairly minor rules changes but with a large number of new player options. Another major revision occurred in 2000 with the release of 3rd edition and the subsequent d20 System boom (and then bust). A 4th edition was released in 2008 with some signiﬁcant mechanical changes that were largely met with derision from the established fan base although this edition did see some crossover in the fan-base with MMORPG games. Finally, the current edition, the 5th for the game, was released in 2014 to critical and fan accolades.  This new edition streamlined much of the game mechanics making it very easy for new players to learn.  It also offers a wealth of player character options. There has been much talk online about Wizards of the Coast updating the Greyhawk setting to the new edition however, the case can convincingly be made that no such update is required. There is absolutely nothing stopping a new player or DM from picking up the 1st Edition Folio or Boxed Set and running a 5th Edition game.  Nothing perhaps but lack of imagination. Gygax set the default year of of world at 576 CY. As Gygax wrote in his World of Greyhawk folio, “The current state of affairs in the Flanaess is confused indeed. Humankind is fragmented into isolationist realms, indifferent nations, evil lands, and states striving for good.” He did not issue monthly or yearly updates to the state of affairs as presented in the folio since he saw 576 CY as a common starting point for every home campaign; because each would be moving forward at its own pace, there would be no Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 8 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. practical way to issue updates that would be relevant to every Dungeon Master. Gygax was also aware that different players would be using his world for different reasons. When he was the Dungeon Master of his home campaign, he found that his players were more interested in dungeon-delving than politics; but when he switched roles and became a player, often going one-on- one with Rob Kuntz as Dungeon Master, Gygax immersed his own characters in politics and large-scale battles. Knowing that there would be some players looking for a town in which to base their campaign, and others interested in politics or warfare, Gygax tried to include as much detail as possible about each region, including a short description of the region and its people, the title of its ruler, the racial makeup of its people, its resources and major cities, and its allies and enemies. For the same reason that he had created a variety of geographical, political and racial settings, he also strove to create a world with some good, some evil, and some undecided areas. He felt that some players would be happiest playing in a mainly good country and ﬁghting the evil that arose to threaten it; others might want to be a part of an evil country; and still others might take a neutral stance and simply try to collect gold and treasure from both sides Fifth edition does pose some difﬁculties for those interested in playing in the World of Greyhawk however if they are looking to play in the setting with the same theme and overall feeling of those 1st edition games. Whereas AD&D grew organically, starting with a simple Fighter/Cleric/ Thief/Magic User base and expanding options over time from that base, 5th edition comes out of the gate as an all inclusive system, attempting to provide as many player options as possible.  This makes for a “kitchen sink” sort of game and this is evidenced in 5th Edition’s default setting of The Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting. It can be argued that Greyhawk too is a kitchen sink setting; it has crashed spaceships and six-gun shooting demi-gods and vast swaths of unmapped territory where nearly any types of character, monster or culture could ultimately hail from after-all. Hoverer, whereas in The Forgotten Realms having Orc, Drow or Bugbear characters may be common place, such player characters in Greyhawk would face massive challenges, namely, every town guard and peasant with a pitchfork would be out to kill them. The 5th Edition of D&D has gone out of its way to be inclusive of all types of players across race, gender, sexuality, etc., and that is a great thing. However inclusivity of players in the game does not mean inclusivity of every player option in the game setting. For example, the Fifth Edition of the game includes several “exotic” races and character classes not found in the original game.  As far as the character classes go, most, if not all, of the new classes can fairly easily be adapted and used in the original Greyhawk setting. The new races however can pose multiple issues.  New additions like Dragonborn and Tielﬂings as core races cause some issues as they were not found in the original Greyhawk setting.  To the average inhabitant of the Flanaess, these “races” would be “monsters” and, as aforementioned, would likely cause great panic if they were not attacked outright on sight. Preface 9 We’ve re-imagined Tieﬂings to make them, and other “non- traditional races” like Genasi and Firbolg, more in keeping with  the overall feel and theme of the classic Greyhawk setting. The key here is “not found in the original setting”. Remember, the original setting only included a small portion of the continent of Oerik. Therein lies the solution to the inclusivity of all for the 5th Edition options. Beyond the borders of the Flanaess gives us the “Here There be Dragonborn!” option. The lands beyond the Flanaess have only been brieﬂy described in ofﬁcial material, most from old Dragon Magazine articles and references in the Gord the Rogues series of novels penned by Gygax pre and post-TSR. In fact, the Oriental Adventures sourcebook, ﬁrst published in 1985, was originally intended to be an expansion of the Greyhawk Setting (as seen in the announcement at upper right from Dragon #102).  For whatever reason, it was eventually published as an expansion to The Forgotten Realms setting instead, placing the lands of Kara- Tur on the Realms world of Toril and not Greyhawk’s Oerth. That said, Gygax clearly had a vision for adding  “asian-style” cultures in his world of Oerth.  We have taken that concept and will be adapting much material from the original Oriental Adventures books when creating the lands of the Ryuujin and Celestial Empires, Mur, Komal, Sa’han, etc. Greyhawk also has some other player options not found in other published settings.  The Half-Ogre, for example has a long history of being “the best darn door- opener there is” since its original mention by Gygax in Dragon #29 (Sept 1979) and its ﬂeshing out by Roger E. Moore in Dragon Magazine #73 in May 1983. There are also new sub-races not found in the 5e Player’s Handbook such as the enigmatic Valley Elves, the noble Gray Elves and even Gnomes differ somewhat from the default as shown in the PHB. We’ve even added a few new twists and other new playable options as well to keep things interesting. Finally, this is not merely a simple update to the setting for 5th edition compatibility.  Rather it is more a re- imagining and kit-bashing of the setting, making it dynamic rather than frozen in time while still providing that old school feel and sandbox nature of Greyhawk. So, with the above said... Welcome to Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY. Dragon Magazine #102 (Oct 1985) Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 10 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. So who is this book for? Greyhawk Rebooted began as a project to codify and update my on-and-off 30+ year campaign to the current edition of the game.  As new 5e publications were released, I added new classes, races and other features to my Greyhawk.  Let me repeat that... this is MY version of The World of Greyhawktm; there are many like it, but this one is mine. And now it can be yours too.  Originally this book was intended for my players, to put all of the player options in one place for them simply for ease of use. It served as an introduction to the setting for new players over the years and it showed old Grognards who played at my table to un- derstand how this Greyhawk differs from what they might already know. Since Greyhawk was Gary Gygax’s home campaign setting, it also became the de- fault D&D setting for much of the early history of the game. It also served as the default setting for much of 3rd edition. An executive decision was made early that only source material extant during Gygax’s creative leadership of the setting would be adopted as canon for our rebooted version of the setting.  That is the starting point. So what does that mean? Well for starters, it means things like the Greyhawk Wars or the rise of Turosh Mak simply have not happened. The Vatun ruse Iuz used to ma- nipulate the northern barbarians hasn’t happened.  The Great Kingdom has not self-destructed and the Scarlet Brother- hood is still an enigma to most people on the Flanaess. We’ve reset the clock to 576 CY which is the default starting time presented in the original folio and the 1983 boxed set. From this starting point we have set about re-imagining the setting with as little bias from later published materials as possible. While I’m no JJ Abrams, I tried to re-imag- ine the setting through an Abrams-like lens. Just like his re-imagined Star Wars and Star Trek universes are very familiar, they are also new and exciting in many re- spects. Kirk and Spock are still there but Abrams blew up the plant Vulcan for ex- ample! So what was the process? First let me ex- plain my overall approach to world build- ing, something I’ve been doing for over 40 years. My formal education is in anthro- pology and history so my natural inclina- tion is to give the world an organic feeling. I ask myself “why” and “how” a lot. Why is this population where it is? How did it get there? What kind of society would they build and what impact would magic and the supernatural have on their develop- ment? I looked to real world history and migration patterns of populations for in- spiration. I wanted to recreate the Oerth version of the Indo-Europeans and similar groups and let them evolve on Oerth in a natural manner. I applied this questioning to nearly all aspects of Greyhawk but I did not want to fundamentally change the na- ture of the setting.  The last thing I wanted to do was turn Greyhawk into a “kitchen sink” setting just so 5e material could be shoe-horned in. This required a complete re-imagining of Oerik prehistory.  I’ve reviewed many fan-created histories, including that of for- mer TSR writer, Len Lakofka, and I adopt- ed some of this material but found that an entirely new history was required for the reboot.  Drawing on some obscure canon lore from the history of the Githyanki, I stumbled upon the notion that the Gith were once human, their original home world being Oerth where they lived in an nation called Zarum that was subsequent- ly conquered by Mind Flayers.  From this canon nugget, I began reworking the histo- ry of the world, weaving in other previous lore and background material as needed. Preface 11 Slowly the other regions of Oerik were ﬂeshed out, not in a vacuum but rather as part of a uniﬁed history of the entire continent.  The Suel backsto- ry was further expanded and lands merely hinted at in the Gord the Rogue novels were given life and linked to the world in a natural and inte- grated way. On the Baklunish people and their homeland... this region was the least developed in the original folio and boxed set. There is very little detail pro- vided for their nations and cul- ture and out of the core human have been returned to their Arabian, Per- sian and Turkic analogs. We didn’t want real world modern Arab stereotypes con- fusing things so to solidify this, we dou- bled down and made the Baklunish West a land of wonder and intrigue, one populat- ed by elementalist wizards and sorcerers, one where genies walk among mortals and their offspring, the Saab’Sirat (i.e. genasi, are not uncommon.  We re-imagined their cultural development from the time of the Twin Cataclysms forward and we expand- ed them further west to the lands of Ri- say and Komal which were mentioned in passing in Gygax’s Gord the Rogue novels. And then there is the map.  There are two “canon” maps of Oerik beyond the Fla- naess.  The one found on page 7 of the original folio and then there is the map published as the ofﬁcial setting from the Chainmail miniatures game that WOTC republished in the early 2000’s. This lat- ter map radically expanded the landmass of Oerik to, what I consider, a completely sub-races (i.e. ethnicities), the Baklunish have the lowest word count in the origi- nal sources. They don’t even have a ful- ly ﬂeshed out pantheon of gods and god- desses like the Oerdians, Flan, Suel and even the Olman did later (in post-Gygax development). The Living Greyhawk cam- paign was the ﬁrst time that the Baklun- ish West was ﬂeshed out.  Unfortunate- ly, the Living Greyhawk teams made the Baklunish analogous to real world Islam- ic culture, right down to the use of the words mosque, mufti and imam. Whereas the original Gygax-era Baklunish had a vaguely pre-Islamic Arabian/Persian feel to them in the vein of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, this new Living Greyhawk treatment made them Oerth versions of Muslims, even giving them their own Sun- ni/Shia schism. While I understand the attraction of grounding them in real world tropes, there is a religious and racial insensitivity to it that did not sit well with me and this change was never adopted into my home campaign. So, in the rebooted version, the Baklunish have been de-Islamiﬁed.  They Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 12 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. unrealistic scale  Add to that this expand- ed map was also uninspired aesthetically (it was a huge rectangle with triangle is- lands at the corners) and the original fo- lio map was the one Gygax worked from... we went with the earlier map as our can- on geography. Since it was really only an outline map, we went to work building the major mountain ranges, rivers, forests cities, trade routes, etc. Similarly, the Olman and Touv, human sub-races published after Gygax’s depar- ture form TSR are little more than vague stereotypes of essentially how western popular culture stereotype meso-Ameri- can and pre-colonial African cultures.  In the  case of the Olman, real world Mayan and Nahuatl deities were adopted whole cloth and the myth of the human-sacriﬁc- ing savages was continued. It was also in this way that the Suhfeng, Zahind, Murians and Risayn were detailed and ﬂeshed out.  Careful consideration was given to making them unique cul- tures that stand on their own and that are not simply cookie-cutter reproductions of real world cultures.  So while the Celestial Empire of western Oerik may have fea- tures reminiscent of the lands of ancient China and Japan, we make a conscious decision to change the history and culture enough to turn things on their head with the use of fantasy elements. It seemed like an obvious design choice to weave in actual Celestials into a nation called the Celestial Empire after all. So on the base of a mythic ancient Chinese-like culture, we overlaid core D&D tropes like demons and dragons. We’ve taken a similar ap- proach with the Rhenee and the negative stereotypes associated with the real world Roma people. In rebooting the setting we have attempted to correct some of these previous design decisions to make these cultures more three dimensional. Finally, a word on the post-Gygax ma- terial.  As mentioned previously, the de- fault year for this reboot it 576 CY.  That means things like the Greyhawk War, which occurs after 576 CY on the time- line, have not happened yet.  That part is easy.  What was more problematic was the massive amount of detail the Living Greyhawk campaign added to the setting. While some of it was time-stamped and therefore easily ignored, other materi- al expanded upon history or added geo- graphic or demographic details.  For these we simply kept the stuff that worked with our newly re-imagined Greyhawk and ig- nored the rest. So, these are the basic foundations of the process used to re-imagine and reboot the setting.  We hope you enjoy exploring it. Use the stuff you like, ignore what you don’t. That has always been the genius of the Greyhawk setting. Its always been a sandbox.

Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 15 The Continent of Oerik I t was established long ago, as everyone knows, that Oerth is a great rotating sphere ﬂoating in a void, around which the sun and moons revolve. Careful mathematical measurements and magical divinations reveal that the circumference of Oerth is 25,200 miles. Thus, the diameter of Oerth is about 8,021.5 miles, and the total surface area is about 202,139,540 square miles. Oerth is but one world among many, separated either by the invisible ether, or the fragile veils of reality. The craft and persistence of magic deﬁnes the very nature of Oerth. Throughout recorded history, magical conﬂict and restoration have shaped this world. Some of these magic-driven events touch upon the history of other worlds, and portals sometimes open between Oerth and alien spheres. Few other worlds boast the magical profundity of Oerth, and many strange beings are found there, drawn by the lure of the supernatural. The majority of such entities make their homes far from the sunlit skies of Oerth’s surface, preferring to live secretly in lightless caverns below, where they may thrive and plot unseen. If the paths of the underworld are hidden from view, the wise may still turn their attention to the heavens. All know that the sun travels once around Oerth every 364 days, visiting the Twelve Lairs of the Zodiac in an appointed round that never varies. The pale Great Moon, called Luna, waxes and wanes in ﬁxed cycles of 28 days each, upon which the months are based. The aquamarine Lesser Moon, Celene, follows a path that reveals her full beauty but four times each year, thus showing the time for civilized festivals. When both Mistress and Handmaiden, are full, things of great portent are likely to occur, depending upon the positions of the ﬁve wandering stars in the Lairs, naturally Oerth has at least four continents, the largest of which is Oerik (which makes up about 14.66% of Oerth), lying mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. Southeast of Oerik lies the much smaller landmass of Hepmonaland, lying in the tropics. Telchuria (after Telchur, the god of winter), lies at the north pole, while a near-mythical fourth continent lies in the southern hemisphere (known to some as Aqueneth or Aquaria). Oerth also has a number of islands surround it, the largest being Fireland in the northern Solnor Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 16 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy.

Polaria is a chain of mountainous islands covered for at least part of the year by the southern polar ice cap. The northeast corner of Oerik is known as “the Flanaess”, after the indigenous Flannae people. It is the area covered in previous Greyhawk publications such as the original 1980 Folio and later the 1983 boxed set. The Flannaess, (not including Amedio, Hepmonaland, Dry Steppes, Sea of Dust, Land of Black Ice, or large bodies of water) is approximately 6.5 million sq. miles of land. The most fantastic of many worlds, Greyhawk’s world of Oerth is a place where powerful creatures contest with humanity and other races, where good folk struggle against evil, and Law wrestles with Chaos, Oerth is a world of magic, mystery,  and the imagination. Some say the gem of this world is the city of Greyhawk, a teeming metropolis that attracts heroes and villains alike. Warriors, merchants, wizards, beggars, clerics, sages, and thieves ﬁll its streets in search of high adventure. Those in western Oerik instead marvel at the wonders of Tianshi, the Celestial City, said to be home to over a million people from over a hundred different races. Geographic Divisions When referring to the World of Greyhawktm, one is typically talking about the northeast portion of the continent of Oerik known as the Flanaess. This is the area best deﬁned and described in the original Folio and Boxed Set editions of the setting however it is only a small portion of the continent of Oerik.  Oerik is divided into a number of geographic and/ or cultural regions. The “mega-region” known as the Flanaess consists of the Sheldomar Valley, Old Ferrond, the Bitter North, Rhizia and Old Aerdy East and West. Baklunish West Survivors of the Invoked Devastation settled these temperate prairies, forests, and coastal lands about one thousand years ago. Largely separated from the rest of the Flanaess by the great Yatil, Barrier Peaks, and Crystalmist Mountains, these realms are a stronghold of Baklunish culture. The Kettites have slightly mixed bloodlines from interacting with the people of Bissel, Veluna and Perrenland while many Paynim clans are of mixed Baklunish/Suhfeng ancestry. Peoples of this land range from nomadic horsemen to grand merchant cities with powerful navies. This land is stable and secure, with few current outside threats. Ket occasionally send small raids to Bissel and Veluna, Ekbir suffers piratical raids from the Ataphad, Tusmit remains stable by playing neighbour off neighbour and Zeif is constantly pushing back against nomads from the Plains of the Paynims and undead hordes that occasionally move into their territory from the ruins of the old Baklunish Empire. The Bitter North The lands north of the Yatil Mountains, from the Dramidj coast to the Fellreev Forest and Bluff Hills, make up the Bitter North.

Each Festival is 7 days long. euroz, and jebli;  except in Perrenland. This region is grouped more for geography than similarities between it’s inhabitants. The Baklunish Chakyik and Wegiur, the Flan Rovers of the Barrens, Blackmoor and Perrenland do not share many cultural connections. This region also includes the lands of the evil demigod Iuz who has expanded his territory from his original realm north of Lake Whyestil to include most of the land from the western edge of the Vesve Forest across the north-central Flanaess to the borders of the Horned Society and the Barrens. The Bitter North is generally wilderness dotted with ruined human towns and active orc lairs. The Celestial Empire By far the largest region on the continent,   it is dominated by a single nation: the Celestial Empire. Stretching from the Tyurzi Mountains in the east to the Pearl Ocean in the west and the western Dramidj Ocean to the north this region also contains other independent and semi-independent nations, the wastelands of Pesh and the frontier and wilderness region of Wunan. The  region is known as the home to Oerik’s largest city: Tianshi, capital of the Celestial Empire and home of the Empyrean Jiao. The Empire actively defends against outside and humanoid excursions coming from the wastelands of Pesh to the north and the Emperor long ago erected the Demon Wall to aid in that effort. This massive stone structure, said to have been pulled from Oerth itself in a single day, is truly one of the wonders of the world. The longest mountain range and tallest peaks in all of Oerik are found among the Tyurzi Mountains that divide central and western Oerik. This near impassible range is home to a number of nations of humans, dwur, goliaths, aarakocra, and goblinoids. This regions is largely made up of small, independent principalities with three major exceptions: the mixed Suhfeng-Baklunish trading superpower Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 18 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. of Sa’han who control trade through the Taklan Pass, and the high altitude monastic nation of Behow which is populated by humans of mixed Suhfeng- Baklunish-Zahind stock and Oerik’s largest population of Goliaths. Many Dwurholds also riddle this alpine region. Ghayar Coast Most lands that touch the southern Gulf of Ghayar were once part of the old Baklunish Empire. After the Invoked Devastation many refugees ﬂed north and west. A large group were led by the Djinni known as Risay and the nation she founded still bears her name.  This region is arid and dry with its largest feature being the Great Flame Desert and its colourful dunes. Here dwell the dervishes of Komal and the desert forms a natural barrier between the Baklunish Risayni and the Murian city-states to the north. On the eastern shore of the Gulf of Ghayar is the original central portion of the old Baklunish Empire, its ruined legendary capital existing somewhere within.  This region today is avoided by nearly all living things and is now a land dominated by undead horrors and ruined landscapes. The great Dragon Road between the Baklunish and Suhfeng nations gives this area a wide berth. Finally this region also covers the mixed Baklunish-Suhfeng Khanate of Jurun in the western Dry Steppes and the new Oerdian colony of Prestoria in a valley of the Tyurzi Mountains southeast of the Taklan Pass. Hepmonaland Hepmonaland is a sub-continent to the southeast of the Flanaess. Hepmonaland is the Suel name for the land, while the Olman call it Xamolatatl, “Home of the People,” and the Touv call it Melavi, “The Bountiful Place.” The northern half of the sub-continent is largely tropical rain forest and swamp while the southern half is primarily scrub and savannah with the Great Southern Desert at its southern terminus. Hepmonaland is primarily populated by a human group known as the Touv with a signiﬁcant Yuan-Ti presence in the northern jungles where remnants Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 19 of the ancient Torhoon Empire still exist. Tabaxi leonin barbarians dominate the areas on the edges of the Great Southern Desert. Hobgoblin pirates which ply the Oljatt Sea are thought to have a presence in Hepmonaland as well. The land is bounded by the Densac Gulf and Vogan Sea to the west, the Solnor Ocean and Sea of Sharks to the east, the Tilva Strait to the northwest, and the Oljatt Sea to the northeast. A spur of islands splits off from the sub-continent’s western shore, curving north to form Xuxchan Bay. A large island, the Isle of Singing Stones lies to the southwest. An unhealthy tropical marsh, the Pelisso Swamps, sits along much of the continent’s northeastern coast. Old Aerdy East The lands south and east of the Rakers and north of the Vast Swamp, off to the Solnor coast, are the heartland of Aerdy, the Great Kingdom. Once dominating much of the Flanaess, the Great Kingdom has been in decline for centuries. These lands are rich and their climate pleasant, though long years of oppression have damaged the economy. It is not unheard of for euroz and goblinoid races to live among the numerous, warlike Oeridians here and most major cities of the region have signiﬁcant half-orc minorities. Hellborn Tieﬂings are also not unheard of in this region and many are open about their ﬁendish heritage. Aerdy East also covers the regions that have broken away from The Great Kingdom in recent decades who now form the Iron League defensive alliance.  These include the olven nation of Sunndi, Onnwal, the City of Iron Gate, Idee and the dwarves and gnomes of the Glorioles and Hestmark Highlands. Old Aerdy West These lands between the eastern and southern Nyr Dyv and the line marked by the southern Rakers are temperate and fertile. The Griff Mountains form the northern boundary. Oeridian-Suel bloodlines are dominant in this region, with strong Flan inﬂuences in the Pale. This was the last region to be settled by the Oeridians. The southern area was once the tribal homeland of the Oeridian Nehron tribe, and the entire region was then part of the Oeridian-dominated Great Kingdom, but after Nyrond claimed independence, so too did Urnst, Almor, Tenh and The Pale. This region is noble but beset by many enemies and with ever dwindling resources and internal stability. Old Ferrond The lands from the north coast of the Nyr Dyv to the Yatils and south to the Lortmils Mountains are an old stronghold of Good in the Flanaess. The rich soil and the pleasant climate, combined with healthy trade relations with their neighbours to the east, south and west, make this a strong and wealthy region. Centred on the Velverdyva River this land was largely populated by Oeridians in it’s early history, but has strong inﬂuences from Suel and Flan heritage. Once part of the Viceroyalty of Ferrond, which in turn was part of the Aerdi Great Kingdom, the nations of this region have since become independent and remain on good terms with each other. It is threatened by the Lands of Iuz and the scheming Horned Society to the North. The region surrounding and north of The Great Rift, once part of the Northern Marches of Aerdi, have fallen into anarchy and is currently ruled by a number of petty kings, princes and warlords.  Humanoids, and worse, abound in these Bandit Kingdoms with the human Shield Lands establihsed to the south to check their expansion. The Kingdom of Furyondy and Archclericy of Veluna dominate this region which also includes the olven nation of Highfolk, the noniz Viscounty of Verbobonc, and the Free Cities of Dyvers and Greyhawk. Finally, the enigmatic Horned Society Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 20 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. forms a bastion of evil in this generally good-aligned region of the Flanaess. Rhizia The isolated, mountainous region at the northeastern edge of the Flanaess is home to many barbarians of nearly pure Suel blood. A cold stretch of land, divided by mountains, it’s a ruggedly beautiful landscape with coniferous forests and deep fjords. The climate is subarctic, with rocky soil and a brief growing season. The northern Suel that inhabit this realm call their land Rhizia. This “nation” consists of three rival groupings: the Fruztii or Frost Barbarians, the Schnai or Snow Barbarian and the Cruski or Ice barbarians. It is known as the Thillonrian Peninsula to most non-Suel cartographers. The Hold of the Stoneﬁst, located on the coast of the Icy Sea is a mixed Flan-Suel nation, and has gained many enemies over the years. Sheldomar Valley The fertile Sheldomar Valley is almost completely enclosed by mountains until it reaches the Azure Sea. Two great rivers, the Sheldomar and the Javan, water these lands between the Crystalmists and the Lortmils. The climate here is warm and mild, and many olves, dwur, noniz, and hobniz live in peace alongside Suel, Oeridian, and Flan farmers and lords. Once all part of Keoland, many of the neighbouring nations like the Flan-dominated Grand Duchy of Geoff, the Earldom of Sterich, the Gran March and the freemen of The Yeomanry grew independent after disagreeing with Keoland’s past militarism. The region is threatened by humanoids, including giants, from the surrounding mountains and the organised humanoid forces of the Pomarj. Zahind The lands of Zahind are located adjacent to Old Zarum, between the great Tyurzi and Zahind mountain ranges with the Vogus sea to the south. It is larelgy populated by humans but much poltiical power rests in non-human hands. The area was once a single, large kingdom but it was invaded and partially occupied by the Suel Imperium in ancient times. In 576 CY, the region is dominated by six kingdoms, known as Rajis, half of which are ruled by non-humans (a naga, a rakshasa and a tabaxi to be precise) Isolated Realms These strange lands include the deadly Sea of Dust, the jungles of the Amedio, and Vulzar, the newly discovered island of Fireland, Old Zarum, Dry Steppes, Telchuria, and many islands along Oerik’s coasts. There is little commonality between them in terms of geography or demographics making this a catch-all category. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 21 A History of Oerik The oldest myths and legends tell of many different things; the humans tell of the time of change, when the very magic of Oerth forged the different races from a human stock, some olves speak of “The Awakening,” when they found themselves on Oerth after the battle of Correlon and Gruumsh; the dwur speak of Forge Time when Moradin forged the lives of the Dwarven Fathers and set them under mountain. Other major forces stirred both evil and good, and warfare was frequent. Each of the major races of Oerth split and formed sub-groups which often warred with each other and took different powers to worship. The olves were sundered, some taking to the deep forests, some to mountain fastnesses, some to the seas, and some to the deeps of the Oerth, and so too split Dwarves, and Gnomes. Humanity, the most proliﬁc of the races counted among the higher species (unlike those called lower, created by evil powers in mockery of the earlier formed), spread ﬁrst on the continent later called Oerik. Here, too, were the Demi-human races, and the humanoid hordes most prevalent. The Demi-humans held sway in the east of that land, and the Humans held sway in the west. Much of the land of Oerik was then dominated by three main groups: Giants, Dragons and Reptilians.  Giantkind held sway across most of eastern and central Oerik including the areas now known as Zahind, the Sea of Dust and the Flanaess. Dragons were more prevalent in the west where they preferred solitude, while the reptilian Torhoon Empire dominated Hepmonaland, the Amedio and much of the southern Flanaess. The commonly understood history of the Flanaess begins just over one thousand years ago, when the great conﬂict between the ancient Suloise and Baklunish empires forced massive migrations eastward across, around, and even under the western mountain ranges. This resulted in the mixture of races and cultures that deﬁnes the modern Flanaess. The history of other regions of Oerik are little known by those on the Flanaess and many an Oerdian or Suel sage would be shocked to learn of the advancements made by the civilizations of the Suhfeng and Zin while those on the Flanaess were in the midst of a dark age after the collapse of the Suel and Baklunish Empires. What is presented here is a history of the land accepted by most learned authorities in the civilized realms of Oerik. Not all of it will be known to all sages of course. The current time is the Common Year (CY) 576, which is also 1220 OR (Oeridian Record), 6091 SD (Suloise Dating), 5038 OC (Olven Calendar), 3235 BH (Baklunish Hegira), 2726 FT (Flan Tracking), 3333 ZC (Zin Calendar) and XXXX CR (Celestial Reckoning). Note: When calculating Common Years prior to the Declaration of Universal Peace in 1 CY, remember that Common Year reckoning has no “year zero.” Thus, the time elapsed between 5 CY and -5 CY is only nine years, not ten. Many Flan names are used for the various peoples of Oerik in this publication. Some of the common ones include: Euroz - Orc Eiger - Ogre

Trunkt - Troll    	   Celbit - Kobold Kell - Gnoll Sessk - Lizardfolk Jebli - Goblin Bovaz - Minotaur Hochjebli - Hobgoblin Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 24 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Origins of Humanity Amongst the early human tribes in the southwest of Oerik arose the ﬁrst great civilization of Zarum with its great capital city of Anithor, thought to be home to almost half a million people by -11,500 CY. The Zarumites dominated neighboring peoples, such as eiger and the jeblikind races, and their society was divided into a rigid caste system, their lives ruled by ancient ritual. The ruins of Old Zarum today overﬂow with sacred spaces and temples, though the names of the ancient Zarumite animal-headed gods are still unknown. At some point around 11,000 years ago, the Illithids invaded Zarum from a neighboring plane of existence (most believe it to be the Far Realm). Though the Zarumites fought ﬁercely, they were no match for the psionic might of the Mind Flayers, and soon they were enslaved. Many were brought to the Outer Planes and elsewhere to serve as illithid slaves. Other cities in Zarum were transformed into work pits where illithid overseers forced their slaves to toil for a thousand years. Over the centuries the illithid warped and changed many humans into other species and these new slave races were then redeployed throughout the illithids’ plane-spanning empire. In time the illithid empire was brought down by a rebellion led by a woman named Gith who was raised an illithid slave on another plane but who’s ancestry stretched back to Zarum itself.  As the illithid empire crumbled and Zarum was destroyed by Gith’s forces, the now free residents of Zarum ﬂed for their lives. Although many died trying to cross the mountain ranges and jungles that surrounded Zarum, eventually whole tribes began coalescing for protection as humanity scattered to the four winds. These Zarumite refugees also included the races enslaved by the empire; most notably the Eiger and Jebli, Hochjebli and Buchveer races. They too were scattered by the destruction of Zarum with humanity and in those early centuries they competed and warred with human tribes as they spread out across Oerik. Over the  next 2,000 years humanity wandered and struggled to survive. Multiple tribes of Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 25 humans went extinct while others merged, split apart and reformed over the years. Eventually several dominant cultures emerged. Origin of the Dwur Unlike the other races, the presence of the Dwur on Oerik has been mainly limited to hills and mountains and is accepted to have occurred earlier than most of the other demi-human races. Also unlike the other races, they are very conﬁdent in precisely where they came from. The Dwur believe themselves to be the creations of Moradin, whom they often credit with creating the world and even all the other gods of every race. They believe this event occurred over 10,000 years ago putting their ﬁrst appearance on Oerik around the time the Illithids controlled Zarum in the west. The Dwur however were ﬁrst present in the east; their original homeland is in the Crystalmist and Sulhaut Mountains. The Dwur believe they were created deep beneath those mountains and eventually found their way to the surface where they have slowly spread over the centuries. However much of this falls into the realm of speculation due to the reluctance of the Dwurfolk to share details of their history, especially the origin of their written language and calendar. Most believe this is because they refuse to acknowledge that they acquired both from others due to their pride. It is unclear as to when the Dwur and Duergar diverged from a common culture. The few ancient Dwur records that have become available lack any such distinctions. From various descriptions of individuals, its believed to have occurred at least by four thousand ﬁve hundred years ago. A portion of the ruins of Anithor were eventually colonized by the drow of House Kilsek, who named their new settlement Ka- lan-G’eld. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 26 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Humanity Rebounds By 9,000 years ago a people known as the Su had  migrated to the north of Old Zarum ﬁnding a temporary home on the eastern edge of the Sea of Grass; what is today the Dry Steppes. This large tribe was further split by unrelenting humanoid attacks and by 8,500 years ago the Su had broken in two: the Su-el people moving further north and the Su-feng people, pursued by massive hordes of goblinoids eventually found their way into the lands of what is today the Celestial Imperium. After another millennia of semi- nomadic life the Su-feng started building towns and villages and began organizing themselves politically and militarily to put an end to goblinoid depredations. Under the leadership of four legendary brothers known as the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, they were ﬁnally successful in pushing the vast majority of the Jebli and Hochjebli tribes from the area and into the lands to the south and west of Lake Baiken, a land known as Pesh. This event marked the beginning of the Suhfeng Imperial Count (IC) calendar with Year Zero (-6,850 CY). Unfortunately, the peace only lasted a generation. Upon the death of the last Wind Duke, many Suhfeng warlords arose to claim power for themselves.  This period Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 27 lasted for countless generations and is generally known as the Many Kingdoms period and it lasted well over a thousand years with petty kingdoms rising and falling. Just as the Su-feng originally migrated from the Sea of Grass over the Tyurzi Mountains, their Su-el cousins migrated north. From fragments of artwork still remaining, it appears that the Su-el, unlike their Su-feng cousins, were a light- skinned and fair haired people and they were dogged ever northward by incessant goblinoid raids until they were ﬁnally pushed through the Flame Desert of Risay and Komal and the humanoids ceased their pursuit. The earliest recorded name of the region beyond the deserts where they settled is Mur. Most of the Su-el settled in the lower highlands, tending  goats and  growing olives and grapes.  Befriending the indigenous centaur tribes, within a few generations the Su-el had begun coalescing into towns and small palace complexes.  The great success of the Suhfeng Wind Dukes unfortunately created further woe for their long lost Su- el cousins. Goblinoids and other monsters pushed north by the armies of the Wind Dukes began raiding and encroaching on the peoples that settled in the Murian highlands from the west. Many towns were sacked and refugees again ﬂed; this time back south, through the desert and mesalands of Komal and back out into the grasslands ever harassed along the entire route by bands of goblinoids and human nomads alike. By -6,700 CY, the Su-el who ﬂed Mur encountered ﬁerce tribes in the Sea of Grass descended from other survivors of old Zarum. First the dark-haired Baklun horsemen of the northern plains forced their migrations south into the great basin that surrounded the inland Krakuun Sea and then they were halted by agrarian Oerid tribes at the Niole River (which was renamed the Suel Halt river and now rests well beneath the surface of the Sea of Dust) Here the Su-el faired better as the hierarchical and well-ordered nature of their society and their aptitude for sorcery gave them an advantage over their Oerdian rivals who were not at that time knowledgeable of arcane magic. Over the following centuries they settled, built cities, expanded and consolidated their control over the entirety of the Krakuun Basin which soon became known as the Suel Basin. As the Suel settled and began building cities, far to the northeast, Euroz from the Yatil Mountains effectively halted the nomadic Baklunish push east but the Baklun were content to begin settling permanently on the northern plains and shores of the Dramidj Ocean while their brethren to the west were establishing the ﬁrst Baklun cities on the Ghayar Coast. Origins of the Olve Sages disagree on when and where the ﬁrst Olves arrived on Oerik but it had to have been before the Flan settled the region (so, sometime before the earliest known Flan neolithic sites, or 6,500 CY). As to where, there are two competing theories and olve of all walks of life are passionate about  discussing and extolling the virtues of why their favoured theory is the correct one. The ﬁrst theory, known as The Awakening, has the ﬁrst Olvenfolk appearing in the Adri Forest in the far east of Oerik, arriving from the Feywild. Neither means nor motive for such a journey has, as yet, been learned. The second theory has the olves arriving ﬁrst on the Lendore Isles and then along the coast of what is Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 28 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. today the See of Medegia. In this theory the original olven realm on Oerik is the legendary continent of Aquenoreth (called Aquaria in Oeridian legend), far across the Solnor Ocean. In both theories, after their arrival in the far east, the Olve wandered widely, ﬁrst across the eastern and central Flanaess and then reaching further west to ﬁnally come to settle the high peaks and forested foothills of the northern Crystlamist Mountains. Their ﬁrst interactions with the dwur of this region resulted in deaths on both sides and, to this day, dwur and olve, in general, are not the best of friends. For hundreds of years they co-existed, the dwur beneath the mountains and the olve on their peaks with little interaction or dialogue. The olvenfolk built beautiful palaces and majestic citadels on high peaks and fertile valleys and here in their great cities, they developed the ﬁrst arcane magics known on Oerik. Wizardy had been born. First Contact Around -6,000 CY, wandering olvenfolk from the Crystalmists discovered the nascent Suel cities and, impressed with their drive and ambition began tutoring the humans in mathematics, language, art and, most signiﬁcantly, the arcane art of wizardry. Already having an aptitude for sorcery, the Suel proved apt students and soon were constructing cities and delighted the elves both with their creativity and their productivity. The cities of the Suel were patterned similar to those of the Elves but these occupied the plains and river deltas of the southlands. Suel wizards soon came to hold much of the poltical power of the Suel cities and these cities began to war against each other. Much to the chagrin of the olve, the Suel also began to dabble in dark arts not sanctioned by the elves. In a worst case scenario, an ambitious Suel mage summoned a powerful demon who wreaked havoc and may have obliterated an entire Suel city. This awful incident caused the olves to rethink the wisdom of their having taught magic to Men so widely. They closed down their magic schools and many of the olves departed the Suel cities for their mountains cities with some opting instead to continue their wandering in a westward direction. The Suel mages chaffed at this and were not pleased. They pleaded with the olves to return and teach them more. But their pleas fell on deaf ears. Undeterred, the Suel continued with magical e x p e r i m e n t a t i o n and steadily grew in both mundane and arcane power.  It was not long before they began warring amongst themselves and the Oeridians, Flan, Olman and other minor tribes living in Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 29 the basin soon found themselves enslaved and serving as soldiers in the countless petty wars between Suel noble houses. Origins of the Hobniz Of all the groups with a claim to being the ﬁrst settlers to widely populate the Flanaess, the Hobniz have the best. They were certainly widespread on the Flanaess by the time written records began to be kept. Indeed the nature of the Hobniz written language shows their great dispersion, as the language’s written form is an extensive syllabary intended to accommodate the wide array of dialects used by the disparate groups. Despite this long history, and probably because of their wide dispersal, the Hobniz never developed a calendar of their own, operating simply by following the natural cycles of the year. Nobody can even hazard a guess as to the origin of the Hobniz.  By all accounts, they have always been present on the Flanaess and it is very likely that they are indigenous to the region for early Flan legend refer to Hobniz clans aiding their migrating ancestor in adapting to their new homes on the Flanaess. The dwur also have legends of “Fey and Small Folk” living in the lowlands to the east of their mountain holds that go back to ancient times. Although the Hobniz have been on the Flanaess for millennia, they established no signiﬁcant governments until around the time of the establishment of the Flan calendar (around 2,250 years ago). Early Hobniz appear to have been small scale farmers and herders who lived underground in defensive burrows and are known to have been enemies of the Jebli and Celbit in particular. As mentioned, they aided the Flan ﬂeeing the Suel Imperium and they have also had good relations with the Noniz from their ﬁrst meeting. The Suel Imperium Sages of the Flanaess have only fragmentary knowledge of the ancient Suel Imperium and even less about the times pre-dating it.  One fragment of a text known as “An Imperial Summary of the Regents War Period” has perhaps the most complete details of several centuries of Suel history, speciﬁcally around the establishment of their civilization as an imperial power. According to the text, over ﬁfty ﬁve hundred  years ago, Obendar, a mighty Suloise mage, discovered secret Olven magics and used this new-found power to dominate the ten cities of the Suel. Obendar was crowned First Imperator of the Suel Imperium in -5,515 CY. This marked the beginning of the Suel calendar and Obendar established an Imperial Council comprised of representatives of the Suel noble houses to advise the Imperator on matters of state. The ﬁrst crisis to imperial rule came when the second Imperator died suddenly without declaring an heir. The Imperial Council  appointed a Regency of three men to rule in place of the Imperator in an attempt to shift power from the central government and back to the noble houses. This triumvirate divided the Suel realm into three districts and ruled in an amazingly efﬁcient manner. When the seventh Regency was appointed two of the Regents immediately turned on the third and destroyed him in the First Regent War, claiming that he was possessed by evil beings. When the tenth regency was appointed some ﬁve thousand years ago, the four times great grandson of Obendar, Arianin, approached the Regency Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 30 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. and demanded that he be restored as Imperator. His request was denied and he was imprisoned. Some two decades later, the mage Tilorop, the great, great grandson of the Regent deposed in the First Regent War, freed Arianin from prison. Tilorop told him of an ancient being who spoke to him in his dreams and had revealed a prophecy of the restoration of Arianin to the throne and the greatness of the future Suel Imperium. Arianin and Tilorop then mounted a campaign against the Regency, but were defeated again in the Second Regent War. Arianin was killed, but Tilorop used arcane energy to transform him into the ﬁrst lich on Oerth. After rebuilding their army by raising the dead of their previous failed coup to serve as zombie and skeletons troops, Tilorop and Arianin mounted an ﬁnal attack in the Third Regents War and this time succeeded in overthrowing the Regency Council. Tilorop was appointed Priest Regent and the lich, Arianin, proclaimed himself Imperator of the Suel. Over the following centuries, Arianin tightened his grip on power, expanded Suel lands south into the Sunelan Coast  and raised many undead to bolster his military might and terrorize the citizenry into On the Nature of the Suel Imperium The Suloise Imperium was vastly different things at different times. Compared to it, the Roman Empire was a short lived thing and the Chinese dynasties were only half as old. In it’s early stages, it was comprised of wandering related tribes who developed city states. These city states were similar technologically to the Mesopotamian states on Earth. Then, with the arrival of elves they became more like the Greek polis. And then developed into an empire which structurally was like the Senate driven Rome, and ﬁnally into aristocratic families and princes among which the Imperial rule passed. The Romanesque ﬂavor of the Imperium, was modiﬁed by the inﬂuence of the haughty elves. The elves introduced the magic which drove the quest for power and magic which dominated the whole of the Suel history. This additional element gives the Suloise an oddness unlike Rome in our own world. A sense of haughtiness, of right to power, and of non-concern for others that is still not found in any other culture on Oerth. Even the structured Gray Elves have a sense of wisdom and compassion that is totally foreign to the thoughts of many of the Suloise rulers. The modern Suel (except those living beneath the Sea of Dust, those trapped beneath the Crystalmist, and those in the Scarlet Brotherhood have lost this haughtiness…it is instead often replaced by a bravura, and a wildness which is equally dangerous when roused. The devolved Suel tribes of the Amedio, of Hepmonaland, and the Barbarians in the Northeastern Flanaess exemplify this. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 31 submission. As this situation evolved, the Olve of the Crystalmists looked on in horror. They abruptly ended their relationship with the Suel and closed their borders to the humans. In retaliation, Arianin began raiding the elven lands which escalated as time went by.  Eventually, Arianin made alliances with several giant petty nations to the east of the Crystalmists and, most importantly, the Dark Elves. The War of Light & Dark Up until this time the olve of the Flanaess were generally a homogeneous people who resembled the High Elves of today. Seeing her chance to usurp power from her hated rival Corellon, the olven goddess Lolth corrupted many olve and turned them against their kin. Lolth saw the rise of the Suel as an opportunity and she used Arianin’s ambition to help further her own plots.  Lolth’s manipulations sparked the War of Light and Dark and it lasted centuries which meant little to the lich Imperator or the long-lived olves. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 33 The Olve fought tirelessly against Lolth’s secret alliance. Lolth’s followers became known as the Drow and it created a schism in olvendom that persists to this day. Corrupted by their dark mistress, these olve changed, their skin became dusky charcoal to ebon-hued and their hair all turned bone white. Other olve abandoned their mountain citadels in favour of rustic lives in the forest glens of the Flanaess where they began taking on aspects of their natural environment  and became the Sylvan and Grugach olven folk. Many others ﬂed east, over the Sea of Grass and eventually into the lands of the Suhfeng. By four and half thousand years ago, the last of the great olven cities in the mountains was discovered and destroyed. The defense of the city was so great however, that the Drow were forced underground permanently and the last surviving ancient giant nations of the Sheldomar Valley were effectively destroyed with individual giant clans scattering in disorder to the four corners of the Flanaess and beyond The Suloise army which aided in the destruction of the elven city was destroyed to a man, and no word of them was ever heard. Their goblinoid mercenaries scattered throughout the region taking over abandoned olven settlements wherever they could. The remnants of the olvenfolk migrated eastward to the interior of the eastern portion of the continent. It was the ending of this war and the founding of the Four Olven Realms of the Flanaess that is said to mark the beginning of the Olven Calendar, which has now recorded 5,038 years (as of 576 CY). The original Olven citadels of the Crystalmists were all but destroyed but the hated Drow were driven beneath Oerth for good, the giant nations had all but been exterminated and the treacherous humans returned to their cities to lick their wounds, fearful of a retributive strike from the Olve that would never come. Time of Flowering During the War of Light and Dark many Eladrin from the Feywild were sent to aid the olve against the followers of Lolth. Many formed bonds and relationships with their material plane cousins resulting in the creation of the Gray Olven sub-race (any child born of an Eladrin and High or Sylvan Elf is a Gray Elf as is the child of two Gray Elven parents of course). The westernmost of these, the “Realm of Highfolk” in the Yatils and the Vesve was established as a guardian against the Suel and the Drow. This realm was established with the Sylvan Elves of the Vesve. Of all the elven realms, it was the most open to other races, allowing humans, gnomes, halﬂings and even dwarves to partake of it’s society. The second Kingdom, Celene, also called the “Heart Jewel of Elvendom”, was established by high and gray elves. It, alone of the realms, has always been ruled by an elven queen. The third Kingdom, Aliador, was established in the Griff Mountains and the plains to the west to the shores of the Nyr Dyv. This was the Crown of the Olven seat, and was inhabited almost exclusively by Gray Elves and their servants. The High King of All Olvendom had his palace here. The Fourth Realm, Arrisa, was established by a council of mages and priests in the southern islands now known as the Lendore Isles. It is called “The Secret Realm” and it has long been a closed society. Little trafﬁc passes between this realm and the remainder of the Flanaess. Over the next two millennia the olven realms ﬂourished in relative peace and Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 34 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. seclusion, the battles with humanoids were frequent, but the might of each of the realms remained  unchallenged. This was known as “The Time of Flowering” and much of the best of olvendom came to pass in these days. The 12 gray elven cities were built, including Erieadan, the High Seat of Olvendom and The City of Summer Stars. Many mighty magics, songs and items of beauty were crafted in this period. The history of this time is largely hidden from humans, however, because there were few humans in the east at this time. Elves rarely speak of it today. Among the few known personages to have lived during this time were Queen Ehlissa and the Elven Minstrel Ye’Cind. The Time of Flowering came to an end sometime before the Flannae began their migrations into the Flanaess. Sometime between -3,000 and -2,266 CY Aliador and the last High King, Gilthonial,  fell to a massive horde of Euroz, Eiger, Trunkt and other foul creatures that spewed forth from the massive underground city of Garel Enkdal. Not a single olve is known to have survived and Aliador is still known to this day as the “Lost Kingdom.” Origins of The Noniz The Noniz have had a less turmoil-ridden history than the olve  or the dwur, and most consider that to be a good thing. Gnome history is shrouded in myth and legend.  Elders tell of the distant past when Noniz ﬁrst came to the Flanaess, ﬁnding themselves “shipwrecked” on Oerth. Although given little credence by most non-Noniz sages, the gnomes claim to hail from an entirely different world. Where this world is or what its called none can say. Noniz myth tells how Garl Glittergold and his fellow gods were guiding the Noniz to safety after the conquest of their homeworld aboard massive sailing vessels that could traverse the heavens. At least one such vessel crashed into the tundra north of the current Archbarony of Blackmoor near the mysterious Land of Black Ice some 4,000 years ago. Legends speak of a great leader named Uldra who led them from the ice and wooded highlands of the far north. After several generations the ﬁrst great gnomish settlements were established in the Lortmils, Verbobonc, the Kron Hills, and the Flinty Hills, and in other environments where dwarves tended to dominate. This seems to have occurred sometime during the period of the four Elven Kingdoms as Celene was well established by the time the Noniz had reached the Velverdyva River. Over the centuries they would come to colonize as far as the Yatil  Mountains in the west, the Good Hills in the Sheldomar Valley and the Hestmark Highlands to the southeast. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 35 Fall of the Lich Emperor After being in power for almost 400 years, by -4,600 CY the chief houses of the Suel had had enough of their undead overlords and all rose up in unison to overthrow the Priest Regent, and drive Arinanin into the north. The priesthood of Tharizdun was likewise driven out. Many priests ﬂed northeastwards, and established a temple somewhere in southern Yatils. The senate was re-formed at this time to rule the Imperium and they enacted new succession laws giving the senate the sole ability to name an Imperator’s heir. Nar of House Neheli was named Imperator. Imperial succession continued without scandal for two centuries, rotating through most of the major noble houses. This was a period of introspection within the Imperium and little notice was paid to the barbarian tribes on the edges of the civilization. Conquest and Prosperity No major foe opposed the might of the empire of the Suloise for a millennia and the Imperium and her noble Houses grew incredibly wealthy and powerful. Magic was rigorously pursued. Old olven texts were discovered and studied. Many mages delved into dark arts and began dealing with ﬁends and other extra-planar creatures. The old might and haughtiness of the elves was also copied in the Suel courts. Unfortunately, their wisdom was not— slavery was common and widespread in the Suloise lands, this continued for many centuries as the borders of the Imperium extended north deep into the Sea of Grass and south into the Sunelan Coast and Zahind. The Imperium was on good terms with the dwur High King however fear of their old olven enemies halted any eastern expansion. The Oeridians of this period are perhaps the most oppressed of all Suel subjects forming the underclass of Suel society. Many Oerids began migrating north, out of the Imperium, trying to eke out an existence without Suel overlordship. Many found safety in the broad valley of Ull where they settled. The Suel cared little and routinely sent troops into Ull to exact tribute of their former  slaves. Flan Migrations The Flannae were the ﬁrst to completely break free of the Imperium in -2,266 CY; under the leadership and protection of Beory, Pelor and Rao, they ﬂed their lands just west of the central Crystalmists en mass, making the perilous crossing of the mountain passes after paying a king’s ransom to the dwur for permission to do so. They moved ﬁrst into the Sheldomar valley where several tribes were quickly enslaved by the giants there.  The remaining tribes ﬂed north into the lands of eastern Oerik as the ﬁrst human inhabitants of the area. Initially, they were well received by the demi-humans dwelling there. As they moved deeper into the Flanaess they were welcomed by the Highfolk, but the other olven kingdoms, remembering the disaster of their mentoring of the Suel, closed their realms to humans. After a hundred years of wandering, the ﬁrst great Flannae city of Oerik was established in the Lortmil Mountains in -2,150 CY. Named  Haradaragh, with its founding, the Flan became more than a nomadic people and marked the occasion by starting their own calendar, Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 36 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. abandoning that of the hated Suel. Other Flan tribes continued on and founded other lands. The Flan of Haradaragh found that their presence in the Lortmils was left unchallenged by the olves for a simple reason—the existence of the euroz and jebli of the central peaks. The humans had nearly a century of relative peace in which to build their great capital. It was around this time that other Flan nations began forming including Gyreff, Itar, Nursia, Ahlissa and others. Although no written descriptions of the city of Haradaragh have survived, there are cryptic fragments of songs still sung among those of Geoff, Sterich and the County of Ulek who count themselves of Flan descent. These tell of the spectacular visions of sunrise in the high plateaus of the mountains, the great wide boulevards and plazas of the city, the many-stepped pyramids devoted to the Sun-God, the agricultural terraces of the slopes, the labyrinthine walls protecting the city, and the tremendous wealth brought from the mines below. The more tragic lyrics sing of the last days of the city, when the mines boiled forth with rampaging humanoids and undead horrors slaughtered and ravaged all who would stand against them. Olman  Migrations The Olman of the southern Suel Basin were the next tribe to break out, following in the path of the Flan and avoiding conﬂict with them and the native humanoids and olves as much as possible.  They eventually forged their way into the tropical jungles of Hepmonaland by way of the Tilvanot Peninsula where they were quickly enslaved by the Lizardfolk and Yuan-Ti of the Torhoon Empire. After some time they managed to regain their freedom with the aid of the renegade Yuan-Ti god Kulkatlan and they began raising a number of city- states of their own from the jungles of those lands. Through centuries of warfare, they built an empire eventually covering nearly half of Hepmonaland. Little is known even now of what civilizations they built in that tropical realm, but a handful of facts have been established, and reasonable guesses can be made to ﬁll in some of the blank spaces. Many wall paintings and miniature dioramas in the ruins of Tamoachan indicate that long ago the Olman fought a long series of wars with the Touv . Though the paintings of course place the Olman in a superior position in every battle, there are numerous clues that the Olman were in fact losing most of these wars and were often in a general state of retreat or siege. The origins of these wars are unknown, though there is some evidence that the Olman Empire of this time was dominated by the cult of Mazotz which did have a marked propensity for mass human sacriﬁce in times of societal crisis, often involving thousands of prisoners or slaves at once, and this habit may have enraged its neighboring states in Hepmonaland. The Olman never mastered ironworking in any form, using bronze instead, and rarely engraved metals, preferring to paint or carve stone and wood. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 37 The Beastfolk Returning for a moment to the original human diaspora from Zarum, while the Su super-tribe moved north and west, a copper-skinned people known as the Zin travelled east along the southern coast of Oerik settling between the Tyurzi Mountains to the north, the Zahind Mountains to the west and the Eryp range in the east. The Zin tribe fractured at this point with many clans electing to settle the Zahind lands while others continued their migrations east, eventually settling the Sunelan Coast while others took to the seas, eventually settling the many offshore islands along the southern coast of Oerik. Over time the people of Zahind built a caste-based society in the region and here they lived in relative prosperity, trading with other Zin descendants along the Sunelan Coast to the east and with the highland Suhfeng peoples in places like Behow. As the Suel Imperium expanded, their mages had made  a major arcane discovery: the transmutation of sentient creatures. They began experimenting on their slaves.  In this way, many new races eventually came into being including the So-karan (Skulks), Derro, Jermlaine and others.  Perhaps the most lasting effect these arcane transformation have had on the world are the “Beastfolk” races. The brainchild of a mad Suel mage of power who came to Zahind with the invading Suel armies around -2,400 CY, through dark arcane rituals he merged men with beasts creating the Tabaxi, Nezumi, Loxodon, Vanara and other races. As the Suel conquered more and more of Zahind, they used these newly created slave races to help them dominate the region. Taking advantage of the Zahind proclivity for an ordered, hierarchical society, the beast races were placed above the local humans (except the Suel obviously). Later, freed from their Suel overlords after the Twin Cataclysms, many of these Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 38 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. beast people continued in their societal roles and came to dominate the region as rulers, advisors, scholars and priests while the human population did much of the manual labour. The Great Betrayal After treating with seven nomadic Bakluni merchant clans at a merchant gathering in -2064 CY, the Suel merchant- mage, Odiafer, attacked the Bakluni traders, attempting to take their goods and enslave them. The families drew their wagon trains together and fought to the last person instead of surrendering. Nine years later Suloise armies marched into the northern plains and claimed overlordship. Most nomads put up a ﬁerce resistance but in the end they succumbed to the might of the Suel. The ﬁrst Suloise fortresses in the north were constructed over the next decade. For the next 600 years the eastern Bakluni were subjugated by the Suel. The Suel Imperium had now grown to encompass the entirety of central Oerik from the Dramidj Ocean in the north, to the Vohun Sea to the south and the Crystalmist and Tyurzi mountains to the east and west. Under one of their wandering chieftains, Alib, the Bakluni united in -1,545 CY  in an effort to throw off the Suloise yoke. In -1,540 CY “The First Victory” as the Bakluni call it occurred. This was the War of Seven Score Days, wherein the Bakluni were aided by several Jinn nobles and the war was over in under 3 months. Having an incompetent Imperator on the thrown at the time, the Suloise ceded a large portion of their northern territories to the Bakluni without further conﬂict. Afterward the Amirs gathered and elected Alib by proclamation, as “Padishah of All the Families of the Bakluni.” Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 39 Even though the Suel Imperium and the nascent Empire of Baklun had come to an uneasy peace, several Suel houses secretly continued to plot to undermine the new Bakluni nation, especially in their old territories in the southern Sea of Grass. House Zolax was première amongst these plotting families. The leader of House Fruztii, Bjornal, was manipulated by the patriarch of House Zolax and around -1500 CY  sought to wrest control of a large tract of land ceded to the Baklun after the War of Seven Score Days without Imperial approval. Instead, Bjornal lost to the Bakluni, and his house was shamed for generations. With the defeat of the Suel during this “Fruztii War” The Bakluni tightened their grip on the north even more. By -1400 CY construction had begun on the great city of Ghayar on the gulf of the same name as the central city of the Bakluni people. Several other towns developed as nomadic families and  clans began to build permanent headquarters in their traditional nomadic territories. Upon Alib’s death, his nephew, Mohinid was proclaimed Padishah of the Bakluni. Around this same time, travelling Suhfeng monks of Xan-Yae (q.v.) introduced their faith to the Baklun who were widely receptive due to their being leery of the “mages” in the south. Her faith became popular and some Baklun began developing their own “mental disciplines” in conjunction with their worship. The Slow Decline Now ﬁve millennia since they ﬁrst began exploring arcane mysteries under olven tutelage, the Suel had grown wildly powerful but also wildly corrupt and, in a real sense, evil. In -1,399 CY the Imperator Zeeckar attempted to strengthen his declining realm. To accomplish this he attempted to annihilate the Houses Ulmar and Opell in a single night in what he called The War of Purity. These western houses had long intermarried with peoples like the Suhfeng to the west, and Zeeckar used this as an excuse to tighten his grip on the Imperium. Having spies in the imperial court, both houses had advance knowledge of the plot and ultimately ﬂed the empire by traveling west over the Tyurzi Mountains, where they passed out of eastern memory. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 40 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. The Demon Wars From their earliest migrations to the west of the Tyurzi Mountains, the Suhfeng were friendly with the indigenous  Yokai and Spirit Folk and throughout the Many Kingdoms period, these three peoples had integrated into a new uniﬁed culture which would eventually also incorporate the Korobokkuru of the Minyeo region. For millennia the people of this region had been ruled by a chaotic succession of warlords, princes and petty kings. Some lasted only months while others may have been able to hold onto power for a generation or two before being supplanted by a more powerful, or devious, ruler. This chaotic political structure prevented the Suhfeng from building their civilization beyond a simple agrarian society. Cities rarely exceed a few thousand people at best and most Suhfeng eeked out a rural existence, when they werent being conscripted into any number of warlords’ armies, By 2,000 years ago, the Suh culture had spread to cover nearly the entire western half of Oerik but these  peoples were still fractured politically, broken into over a hundred kingdoms and an ever shifting balance of alliances and wars. This was the perfect chaotic environment; society was rife for interference by demonic outsiders. Tempting warlords with power and guile, more than one demon lord saw an opportunity to not only sow discord and chaos on the Prime Material, but possibly a chance to gain and wield power on Oerth. They set about corrupting Suh warlords who increasingly found beneﬁt in using demonic troops in the incessant wars between states.  Eventually, more and more powerful demons were summoned Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 41 to Oerik and the Suh eventually became enslaved to them rather than being their masters. The demon lords Ablis, Baphomet, Yeenoghu and possibly others, are rumoured to have rampaged across western Oerik during this period, possibly introducing Kell, Bovoz and other monstrous races to the world for the ﬁrst time. Cities became centers of demonic worship and trade and agriculture fell off drastically. After centuries of demonic domination, a wandering band of olve, known as the Neuth, travelling west from the nascent Suel nation, made their way into the region and discovered the dominance the lords of the Abyss had over the people. They helped organzize willing Suhfeng, Spiritfolk and Yokai into a rebel force and began pushing back against the might of the demonic forces. Initially outnumbered by a thousand to one or more, the olve sought out a balancing factor to the evil outsiders and summoned several Celestials to aid them against the hordes of demons. The Demon Wars consumed the region for two centuries but eventually the Empyrean, Jiao, leading allied forces of good, pushed the warlords and their demonic and humanoid forces back to the lands of Wunan and Pesh where Jiao entered into single combat with the last demon lord still on Oerth, Ablis. Legend says their battle lasted an entire year but in the end Jiao ﬁnally brought the Demon Prince low. Knowing that Ablis could not normally be killed outright on the Prime Material, Jiao, in a righteous rage, summoned power from the upper planes that utterly obliterated the physical form of Ablis and in so doing, blasted the region of Pesh, transforming its plains, rolling hills and forests into a blasted wasteland of scrub, poisonous rivers and horrors of all types. Not satisﬁed with simply overcoming his foe, Jiao bound Ablis’ demonic essence and imprisoned him in a great wall that was constructed to close the gap between the Kevek and Irlaan mountains, essentially blocking off access to the south from Pesh, hemming in the goblinoids, demons and other evil creatures for good (in theory at least). Known as the Demon Wall, Celestial troops man its battelments to this day. The Suhfeng viewed the great Empyrean and the other celestials as the saviour of their people and declared Jiao Emperor of all Suhfeng lands, pledging eternal loyalty and obedience to him. He reluctantly accepted the honour, fearful that should he return to the upper planes that Ablis might escape (or be freed) or another demon lord would take advantage and return to dominate the region once again. God-Emperor  of the Suel By -1,100 CY the decay of the Suloise Imperium into crime and corruption could no longer be denied as Emperor Zin Ad-Zol declared himself divine and used the power of the Imperium to enforce his claim. The “god” Zol was rejected outrigtht by the Oeridian tribes to the north and west of the empire. Imperator ad-Zol responded by instigating pogroms against the surprised Oeridian tribes utterly destroying three of the sixteen that then existed. The Oeridians were forced to bow to Zol but The Aerdy (the chief of the tribe of that name) refused, and challenged “Zol” to a duel to the death. The Imperator, a capable warrior and mage himself accepted, but soon found that he was battling none other than St. Cuthbert, himself. Cuthbert reduced ad- Zol to a babbling, drooling idiot. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 42 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. In -1,000 CY the House Schnai, after a short struggle, took the throne of the Imperium. Ovrung the First managed to restore the Imperium to a shadow of it’s former self for a short time. Route of the Olman Far to southeast of the Imperium in Hepmonaland, a another mass migration of Olman royalty and citizens took place, including an often-depicted sea voyage that appears to show the Olman crossing the Densac Gulf from Hepmonaland and arriving on the shores of the Amedio Jungle. This happened about -1,000 CY. From there, they spread out, ﬁrst to the Olman Islands and ultimately the Amedio Jungle, cutting and burning huge pathways through the jungle until they reached certain regions upon which their gods were said to show favour. In these places, the Olman established great cities, cutting back the jungle around them for farmland. Several highly stylized maps found in the government center of Tamoachan hint that there were seven such cities built in the Amedio, with many smaller villages and farming communities surrounding them. Each city and the land around it was treated as a separate kingdom, the city itself being the capital. All cities were united under one great priest-queen in a capitol building, the location of which remains unclear. (It was evidently not in Tamoachan.) The Amedio cities were at ﬁrst treated as colonies of the old Olman civilization in Hepmonaland, but in -805 CY the Amedio Olman culture declared Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 43 itself to be the true nation of the Olman marking the ﬁrst year of the Olman lunar calendar. This may have occurred when the old Hepmonaland Olman culture was ﬁnally destroyed by warfare, disease, internal strife, or other disasters. Nothing more is known of it, though pockets of this Olman culture may still survive there. Tamoachan (“the home sought after”) was the northernmost city of the Amedio’s Olman Empire, which spanned all of the Amedio Jungle, reaching as far north as the Olman Islands. The Olman have a detailed, 13-month calendar based upon the phases of Luna. The Amedio Olman Empire lasted some 500 years before it suffered a devastating series of internal wars. These may have lasted a century, all told, but they ended with the ruin of most of the seven cities. Farming has always been a precarious business in the Amedio, as the jungle constantly and aggressively attempts to reclaim lost land. If most of the peasants of one city were killed in warfare, the jungle moved in all the more swiftly to overgrow unworked ﬁelds. Disease and pests, always present in wartime, may have dealt their own blows. Wall paintings and temple carvings in Tamoachan indicate that only that city and one other, far to the south, were known to have survived the wars, which appear to have been spawned by struggles over precious-metal mines and control over the seat of the emperor. Religious disturbances are also suspected, as some writings predict the coming of a many- eyed being or god who casts ﬁery ruin upon the nation. Rise of Vecna Always a people close to nature and led by druids, some Flan began secretly learning arcane magic from mysterious dark entities who plied them with prophecies and promises of greatness and power. The ﬁrst Flan wizard, Galap- Dreidel was born in Haradaragh but was driven from that city when his magical studies became known. Branded an Ur by  his people, he ﬂed and is known to have built a great tower in the Abbor Alz of the central Flanaess by -990 CY. The Flan word Ur at that time meant “witch” “‘Our sagacious master,’ replied the barons, ‘we advise, and even beg you, to accept the terms they offer.’ But the Whispered One did not listen. That very day the mangonels and war-wizards were set up outside the walls. The assault went on for about ﬁve hours and then the wizened lord broke the walls of Fleeth with a wave of his hand. “By the dawn, the heads of citizens were stacked before the burghers. Their own wives and children stared at them foremost. This was the humour of Vecna, and as his ﬁnal cruelty, he allowed these burghers to depart in peace and guaranteed their safety for the remainders of their sorrowful lives.” - from “The Chronicle of Secret Times” by Uhas of Neheli Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 44 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. but it soon came to broadly deﬁne arcane spellcasters, especially those with a decidedly evil bent. Within another ninety years the Kingdom of Sulm, the ﬁrst great Flan kingdom, came to prominence, also founded by an Ur whose name is lost to history. Few names in the long history of the Flanaess conjure such frequent nightmares though as the Whispered One, Vecna. Though the once supreme lich ruled a kingdom of antiquity, his name has become synonymous with pain, suffering and the price of dabbling in magics not meant for the ken of mortal minds. In -747 CY  this lowborn boy by the name of Vecna was born in the Flannae city of Fleeth, which was located in the Sheldomar Valley. He was initially trained by his mother, Mazzel, in the art of magic, before she was executed by the government of Fleeth for practicing witchcraft. Vowing revenge, Vecna wandered the Flanaess seeking a path to power. Finding his way to Galap-Dreidel’s now-destroyed tower he discovered in its library a book from the Suel Imperium entitled “The Fate of Tilorop”. From this point forward he secretly began to worship Tharizdun. Vecna eventually assumed a mastery of the dark arts achieved by no mortal before or since. For the next quarter decade Vecna  studied “The Fate of Tilorop” and was driven by an insatiable lust for immortality. As Vecna’s power grew he attracted evil men, humanoids  and extra-planar entities to his banner and began building a grand Empire of the Spidered Throne in Sheldomar Valley centered near the modern-day Rushmoors. Conquering tribe after tribe, Vecna began to experiment with his new subjects for the “Ultimate Solution to Death.” Many undead were created in his experimentations. In -719 CY Vecna ﬁnally perfected the technique required for lichdom and transformed himself. He then corrupted and twisted his people, and, through his breeding program, now had a host that far outnumbered any of his possible rivals. Between -712 CY to -699 CY Vecna marched against Haradaragh and after six long years of siege, the ﬁrst Flan city fell. Those unfortunate residents who survived the siege were transformed into undead creatures to a man. After conquering nearly all the Flan tribes in the Sheldomar, he ﬁnally turned his vengeance to Fleeth, intentionally leaving that city as the last jewel to be plucked. Vecna laid siege to the city of Fleeth with an army of arcane spellcasters and undead. Legend has it that Vecna was nearly slain in this battle by clerics channelling the power of Pholtus, the god of light, however he was rescued and brought to safety by one of his apprentices, a cambion named Acererak. Vecna eventually recovered and on the verge of conquering Fleeth, the ofﬁcials of the city came before him to beg for mercy. They offered up the entire city and her wealth if only Vecna would spare the lives of her citizens. Instead, the lich had the entire city gutted, the governors’ wives and children executed before their very eyes, their staring heads displayed upon a vast pile of viscera and gore. As a ﬁnal show of “mercy,” Vecna then granted the ofﬁcials leave to depart, and promising them his protection for the rest of their lives. With his vengeance satisﬁed, Vecna retired to his tower and immersed himself in more arcane research. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 45 Decline and Fall Despite Vecna’s control over such a wide berth of land, his actual grasp did not extend far from his own Rotted Tower, said to be located in the Rushmoors, or the now-ruined town of Tycheron, along the northern banks of the Velverdyva, not far from modern Dyvers. Kas the Bloody-Handed rose to the fore among Vecna’s lieutenants and he was elevated to the position of supreme commander of all of his forces within a year of the destruction of Fleeth. As the arch lich’s body weakened, Kas became his instrument of rule. Though still supreme in his power, Vecna took less and less interest in the daily affairs of his kingdom. Kas pronounced Vecna’s judgments, presided over the Council in Vecna’s name, and heard the reports from Lord Vecna’s foul army. The Bloody-Handed commanded legions of undead, humanoid tribes and several tribes of debased Flan, who were all too happy to carry out the orders of Kas as though they were Vecna’s. Many otherwise good-spirited tribes, however, lived under the depravity of Vecna because all but subservience to the Whispered One led to certain death. After several centuries, Vecna made his ultimate arcane discovery: a means to achieve apotheosis. Vecna intended to become a god! In addition to an unnaturally elongated life, Vecna had granted Kas with a weapon of exquisite beauty and a heart as dark as the lich-lord’s soul. This blade, the Sword of Kas, whispered dark ambition into Kas’ ear, urging him to make a move for the lands his master had held for so long. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 46 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. As Vecna began the ritual to ascend into godhood, at last, emboldened by the sword’s sweet voice, Kas struck at his lord. No man saw the battle, but with its end Vecna’s dark tower crumbled into dust, leaving only the sword and a pile of ash. The body of Kas was never found. Of Vecna, all that remained were his lifeless Hand and Eye. Some of Vecna’s followers later founded a “Cult of Vecna” but Vecna’s empire collapsed. Acererak, Vecna’s loyal apprentice, moved to the Vast Swamp where he built a great underground temple. Centuries later, as indentured Flan dug the foundations of the city of Shiboleth, three remnants of the battle between Vecna and Kas rested upon the ﬂoor of the Rushmoors. A hand, an eye, and a sword black as death. Their story had just begun. Flannae Apex

Two millennia ago Flan civilization reached its zenith on the arid grasslands of Sulm. Here, the ancient Flan learned advanced techniques in agriculture, ironwork and engineering, and founded great cities and raised majestic temples to their gods. With its success Sulm grew, absorbing neighboring states like Nursia and Itar. And like many empires, hegemony bred arrogance and decadence. With those black seeds planted, an evil rot eventually disintegrated the Sulm civilization. Although never in direct conﬂict with the Empire of Vecna, the ﬁnal doom of Sulm came suddenly, in -700 CY, when its last ruler—another Ur like Vecna named Shattados—was granted a boon from his dark patron, Tharizdun. The dark god’s Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 47 gift took the form of a powerful artifact called the Scorpion Crown, which promised to allow Shattados’ true and everlasting dominion over all of his subjects. What it did was transform almost all of Sulm’s people into hideous manscorpions bound to Shattados, and precipitated the eventual decline of the Sulm’s lush grasslands to a wasteland of sand and rock (which is today known as the Bright Desert). Thus Sulm passed into history, languishing all but forgotten except by a handful of sages and adventurers foolhardy enough to brave its dangers. Prelude to War As the Flan kingdom of Sulm was consumed, across the Crystalmists, Oeridian tribes on the edges of the Suel Imperium began assuming more and more control of local affairs, some chieftains paying little more than token fealty to their imperial masters in Suendrako. In -882 CY Oeridian High Priest, Arnd of Tdon, forged the ﬁrst chain link mail shirt to honour the anniversary of the victory of Cuthbert over Zol. The shirt is known as The Invulnerable Coat of Arnd. The Oeridians began widely equipping themselves with chain hauberks and kite shields. In -728 CY plague broke out in the Bakluni Lands. This is the ﬁrst year of those known as “The Plague Years”. Many Bakluni blamed the Suel and began to speak of cleansing the south. Over the next decades numerous plagues swept through the Suel Imperium, some magical and some mundane. The population fell by over 40% , many towns were completely emptied, and border defenses were greatly weakened. Within 20 years the plagues passed and the Suel population began to recover, but the Bakluni peace had begun to break down. Under Padishah Halif the ﬁrst organized raids of the Bakluni into Suel territory occurred in -627 CY. Over the next hundred years, the Baklun prospered as the Suloise fell into confusion and strife between noble houses. The Baklunish courts grew wealthy and prosperous, while the northern Oeridian lands of Ull fell under Bakluni sway. In -604 CY the ﬁrst of the Succession Wars broke out. The Schnai were removed from the throne. After 100 years with the succession falling to nine different Houses, House Zolax regained control of the Imperium. Missionary monks from the hidden Temple of Tharizdun returned to the Suloise Imperium and began winning converts. The Bakluni Padishah withdrew his ambassador from the Suloise Imperium in -504 CY when Zunid-ad-Zol, the Prince of House Zolax was crowned Imperator of the Suel Peoples. The Great Wars The Baklunish-Suloise Wars were a decades-long conﬂict that profoundly altered the course of history of Oerik. The wars began in -484 CY. For many years, raiders on both sides of the Sulhaut Mountains had been pillaging the nation opposite them. The Imperator of the Suel, ad-Zol, sent nine thousand troops to punish the northerners. The ensuing battle on the Fields of Padyr lasted three days, and both armies were all but annihilated. This was but the opening salvo of a conﬂict that would last another 63 years. It was in one of the early battles that the Baklunish monk Zuoken, with 38 others, held off a critical pass from an entire Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 48 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. army of vengeful Suel, earning himself the sobriquet “the Survivor” and inspiring an entire generation. As the war grew more ﬁerce, it is believed that Suloise wizard/priests in the service of Syrul created the Skulk race to inﬁltrate their own government, though it is possible that they were intended as a weapon against the Baklunish. It is clear that, at the time, the Suel were as great an enemy to themselves as to anyone else. They also created the Derro race from foul experimentations with both Dwur and Humans. This slave race they used to tunnel under enemy cities and fortresses to wreak havoc from below not to mention as forced labour in Suel mines. The Thundering Horde Euroz, jebline and other humanoids were widely used as mercenaries by both the Baklunish and Suel Empires in their wars. At the time, most humanoid races were semi-nomadic tribal groups, moving from cave complex to cave complex, raiding nearby areas. Whole groups would simply be paid to migrate into the territory of the other side, and left to their own devices. Poorly organized, and with little supervision other than ensuring they did not migrate into the territory of their employers, these groups fought each other nearly as much as they fought the inhabitants of the empire they were paid to pillage. Their path took them generally north and east, and eventually into contact and conﬂict with the Oeridian tribes then living in what is now modern day Ull. The initial battles typically went in favour of the Oeridians, but the sheer mass of migrating humanoids began to wear them down through sheer attrition. The Oeridians would likely have continued to ﬁght, but two events changed the situation. Among the Oeridians, several prophets appeared, among them Joyhydee, who declared that their deities had ordered them to migrate east, towards fertile lands beyond the mountains. Led by the Aerdi tribe, the Oeridians began moving around -465 CY. Meanwhile, a warlord appeared among the humanoids, and somehow united the tribes, sweeping away their diverse racial, religious, and political differences. How is one of the greatest mysteries of the era, as the humanoids were less inclined to accept the leadership of those not of their race at that time. Indeed, the legends of the diverse groups all refer to this leader as an Orc. While this has long been dismissed as mere posturing, Oeridian legend says that their leader was in fact an avatar of Hextor. The Oeridian deities having indeed decided to send their people east. Hextor united the humanoids, and used them to drive the Oeridian tribes forward. Naturally, being Hextor, he took the opportunity to do so in as violent a manner as possible. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 49 The Thundering Horde, as it came to be known, swept into Ull, overrunning many Oeridian tribes and enslaving them  while driving the others forward at a pace that threatened to kill them as surely as the humanoids of the horde. The Oeridian migration reached its peak within eight years with hordes of non-humans entering the Flanaess behind  them. But having conquered Ull, a new target appeared and distracted the leadership of the Horde. The Twin Cataclysms The disasters in question, in -421 CY, were precipitated when the Suloise Mages of Power, who practiced a kind of magic unknown to the present day, created a terrible cataclysm remembered as the Invoked Devastation. A wave of invisible destruction swept over the lands of the Bakluni from the Sulhaut to the Dramidj and from the Crystalmists to the Tyurzi Mountains. Buildings crumbled as if being powdered by an oerthquake, only the ground did not shake. All living things within the area were sickened. Although some survived, the vast majority were less fortunate. The wind was black and howling, and under its strange force the work of the hands of man decayed as if time were running a thousand times faster for such non-living matter. Living things suffered increased aging, as well. Trees grew suddenly, depleted their soil, and died. Animals and people alike aged and died. Children became old men and women and soon died without Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 50 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. caretakers. The remains of the dead were visible for some period, but the habitations and cities were naught but powder and dirt. In a score of years however, the whole area became covered by weeds and struggling plants, and slowly, as the worms and insects made their way into the soil, the land became a steppeland of short grasses and sedges and became known as the Dry Steppes. The area worst affected appears to be the old Bakluni homelands of Ghayar which, even to this day, is avoided by all sentient creatures as its ruins are home to foul undead not found elsewhere on Oerth. In retribution, the surviving elementalists of the Bakluni gathered within the stone circles of Tovag Baragu and conjured a mighty working, bringing down the terrible Rain of Colourless Fire upon the Suloise basin. The Suloise lands were inundated by a nearly invisible ﬁery rain which killed all creatures it struck, burned all living things, ignited the landscape with colourless ﬂame, and burned the very hills themselves into ash, leaving the Sea of Dust as a monument to the hubris of Man. Together, the Invoked Devastation and the Rain of Colourless Fire are known as the Twin Cataclysms. Thus ended the Baklunish-Suloise Wars. Fall of the Dwur King For thousands of years a High King of the Dwur had ruled his people from a citadel in the northern Crystalmists Mountains. The wealth of the mountains, from the northernmost reaches of the Yatils, down through the southern Crystalmists, was gathered in his citadel. After forcing the Aerdi and other Oerdian tribes out of Ull, rather than pursue the relatively impoverished Oeridians, the Thundering Horde turned its attention to the mountains. For half a century, they fought, foot by foot, through UnderOerth passages, until, as the Twin Cataclysms destroyed the Suel and Baklunish Empires, the horde of Orcs and Goblinoids threw down the last High King of the Dwur, and  scattered the dwur clans ﬂeeing the destruction of their homeland. With the Axe of the Dwarf Lords lost, they would turn on each other, ﬁghting to establish who would rule, while euroz and jebline feasted in the halls of their fathers. Many dwur left to begin new lives in other regions, blending with the colonial clans already living there, whether peacefully or violently. Greedy and ambitious clan leaders in the Crystalmists, meanwhile, no longer bound by allegiance to the High King, fought with each other for control, with the trauma of the Devastation being too much for some dwarves to bear, becoming power-mad as a result of what they saw. Since then, the dwarves have more or less reacted to human settlements following the Great Migrations. Good dwarves had always been distant allies with those of the Flan who were of a goodly weal, and this continued even after the Aerdy Empire rose to its greatest heights. Led by lords and princes of differing noble houses, the dwur clans allied with olves and noniz during the Suel and Oeridian migrations, and even joined humans of reliable disposition to defend their territories. Dwur settlement beyond their homeland began naturally in the Sheldomar Valley and were concentrated in two areas. In the west, the Good Hills, already settled early on by Noniz, became a home for many Dwur clans who found living above ground not-entirely-unpleasant.  These became the ﬁrst of the Hill Dwur. In the Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 51 west, dwur became the primary colonizers of the Lortmils, extending into the Kron Hills and Drachensgrabs. In later years, Celene would blame the establishment of this nation, the Peaks of Haven, for the increase of humanoids below the Lortmils, and interfering with communications between Celene and Tringlee. Over the centuries dwur would settle new homelands as far away as the Tyurzi in the west and the Glorioles and Rakers in the east. Nobody is sure how or when these migrations occurred other than the dwur themselves however one legend speaks of several clans of Mountain Dwur that migrated from the Lortmils all the way to the Rakers, entirely by an underground route. While the leadership of the Thundering Horde had been distracted with the dwur riches, the Oeridians they had previously conquered began to free themselves from their humanoid masters, and ﬂee through the Fals Gap, seeking to follow the Aerdi and others who had left before the coming of the Horde. The Thundering Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 52 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Horde pursued them, following the Velondi, Perren and Ferond tribes into the Velverdyva Valley, and enslaving any they could catch. But once again, the Horde found a new target for their attentions. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 53 The city of Tycheron, located north of the Velverdyva River and once the northern capital of Vecna’s Empire of the Spidered Throne, was now the center of the Flan nation of Veralos. It was a stronghold of powerful magic, and immense wealth. This time the war would last most of a century, and drench the Velverdyva in blood. When it was over, Veralos was no more, the warlords of the Thundering Horde feasting in its ruins, burning them as an offering to their dark gods. When the feasting ended, the Thundering Horde began to splinter, as the warlords of the tribes began to ﬁght amongst themsleves for land, slaves and loot. As they fought, they lost control over the Oeridians, who had allied with the surviving Flan herdsmen and farmers. The Perren retreated into the Yatils and came to settle the lowlands around Lake Quag, pushing the native Flan tribes into the highlands. The Velverdyva Valley and the plains to its north were soon divided into dozens of competing tribal enclaves. These groups fought each other, as well as the olve of the Vesve and Celene for the next four centuries, gradually expanding as far as the Veng, and back to the Fals Gap. The largest state eventually grew up around Mitrik as a joint Oeridian-Flan nation, dedicated to the worship of Rao. Baklunish Resettlement By -406 CY a Bakluni holy man, a Priest of Istus, Ozsef Albaklun, gathered many thousands of refugees and led them to Tovag Baragu, an ancient stone circle of unknown origin, to seek guidance from Istus, goddess of fate, on how they should proceed.  Once there, Albaklun was visited by, and entered into bargains with, 4 genie nobles, one of each elemental type. The genies agreed to take a quarter of the Bakluni people each and act as their mentors and protectors, guiding them to new homes where they could rebuild their great Empire. In exchange, the Jinn demanded 1 day of service per year from every Bakluni... in perpetuity. After discussing it with the three surviving Bakluni Amirs, the deal was agreed upon unanimously. The ﬁrst group to depart Tovag Baragu in a massive caravan of camels, horses and ox-drawn wagons was under the guidance of the great Djinni, Risay.  She led them west along the coast of the Dramidj and founded her eponymous nation near the terminus of the Gulf of Ghayar. Ekbir, the Marid, led the second group to settle his people between the Blashikmund river and the shores of the Dramidj Ocean. It is said he built the magniﬁcent Old City of Ekbir in a single day. The third group followed the Dao, Tusmit, into the hills and mountains to the west of the Yatil Mountains and there the Dao aided them in killing or pushing out a tribe of Oeridians who had ﬂed to this region a generation before. Finally, the last massive caravans departed Tovag Baragu, this one guided by the great Efreet Prince, Zeif. Leading his portion of the Bakluni people to the north and the Dramidj coast, Zeif established his namesake city and declared Albaklun, who had travelled with his group, Sultan of the Bakluni people, a declaration largely ignored by the other groups for now. Rise of the Oeridians By the time the Velondi, Ferond and other Oerid tribes began intermingling with the Flannae in the Velverdyva valley, the Aerdi had reached the Veng after battling across the northern shore of the Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 54 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Nyr Dyv. There they found little opposition for their armies who, by this time, were experienced and very well trained. The humanoid tribes of the region were driven out, the main group of euroz going north to the Dulsi Plain (now the land of Iuz), and the jebline going to the prairies between the Opicm River and Fellreev Forest (now the northern part of the Horned Society). Smaller combined groups went south, settling the Low Road beneath the Lortmils Mountains, beginning the long struggle against the dwur of the Peaks of Haven, and plaguing the olve of Celene whenever they could. Stories of this time are favourites among the euroz and jebli, leaders using them to rouse their people into frenzies against the humans who “stole” their wondrous homeland, where the grass was always green, the game always plentiful, and everyone has their own slaves. In -395 CY the Oerdian warlord Baron Lum established the ﬁrst Oeridian kingdom in the Flanaess. With his disciplined troops and his power of a mighty artifact at his disposal, Lum carved out a mighty ﬁefdom. It is said that, with the artifact that later took his name (the Machine of Lum the Mad), he brought no fewer than 50 new species of monsters into the world. He thought nothing of barrages of ﬁre that annihilated large numbers of his own troops, so long as he carried the day. Lum’s reign was one of cruelty and horror, but it is credited in part for the impressive Oeridian successes in the days before their victories over the rival Suel and Flan were assured. Lum’s reign approached its twilight when his formerly loyal subordinate, General Leuk-O, discovered the Mighty Servant artifact that would become known by his name. Over the next ﬁfty to hundred years the Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 55 Suel and Oeridian migrants vied with each other and the native Flan for lands and territory. The olvenfolk continued to keep their borders shut to outsiders. Other Oeridian and Suel warlords would follow in Lum’s footsteps in the coming centuries. Yagrax Belcrux was an Aerdian High Wizard-Priest who established his own dominion extending out from the Isles of Woe in the Nyr Dyv. The Isles of Woe are most famed for the doom they suffered when the powers of the Codex of the Inﬁnite Planes caused them to sink beneath the waters of the Nyr Dyv. During the nation’s height, Yagrax used the powers of the Codex to conquer the surrounding realms, and even other planes, but the same forces that brought so much power also brought much destruction and woe. Yagrax’ forces also helped push the migrating Schnai, Cruskii and Fuztii Suel houses to the north, diverting them from their planned journey south. Oeridian settlement beyond the Veng began around the year -444 CY, when seven tribes forded the Ritensa and drove off the nomadic horsemen who wandered the area. This was unusual behaviour for the Oeridians; however, their folklore ascribed demon-worship, cannibalism, and worse to the folk who dwelt north of the Nyr Dyv.  A hundred years before, a wandering tribe had been massacred and enslaved by the nomads.  The survivors brought tales of fear and terror back to the west. Over the next few centuries additional Oeridian tribes arrived in the area.  Most often they passed through the existing settlements and settled further north and east (though not always peacefully).  This expansion was halted by the Flan of the Tenha Confederation, an alliance of Flan tribes in the valley of the Zumker River. Other tribes, including the powerful Aerdi, travelled between the Rift and the Nyr Dyv and settled further east. The Machine of Lum the Mad Baron Lum the Oeridian discovered a great artifact deep in the Abbor Alz. After years of experimentation he ﬁgured out how to operate it and with its power, he built the ﬁrst Oerdian nation-state on the Flanaess. What many don’t know is that the Machine of Lum the Mad actually propelled him 802,701 years into the future. There he discovered a strange world where only two humanoid species appear to have survived: the halﬂing-like Eloi and the subterranean, ape-like Morlocks. The rest of the world was teeming with all types of fearsome monstrosities and aberrations. Over several years, Lum used his machine to make many forays into different futures, with each journey however, Lum fell deeper and deeper into  madness. Lum the Mad is known to be responsible for introducing no fewer than ﬁfty new monsters to Oerth.

Early Suel Migrants The Suloise migrants to the Flanaess encompass three separate groups. The ﬁrst were a limited number of colonists sent by the Suel Imperium at its height to establish mining and lumbering colonies. Both were in increasingly short supply back home, and the prices on both were high enough to justify the transportation costs. The second are the dissidents, criminals, and exiles who ﬂed over the Crystalmists prior to the end of Suel-Baklunish Wars. The ﬁnal group were the refugees from that war, leaving to avoid the destruction that would culminate in the Twin Cataclysms. These latter two groups characterized the worst elements of the Suloise (although even the colonists were not particularly pleasant), and their actions have tainted the legacy of the Suloise ever since. Very little of these early migrants is known as most all of their settlements were overrun and absorbed by later refugees. Most of those settlements were in and near the hills and mountains of what is now the Yeomanry, although they had farming settlements across the plains to support them, and some few lumbering camps existed as far east as the Javan River, and south to Jeklea Bay. All of these colonies were established by force, seizing lands and mines from the native Flan, Dwur, and Olve. Oddly, the Imperial overseers preferred to use regular shipments of convicted criminals rather than locally captured slave labor in the deep mines, so aside from the initial violence in establishing the colonies, they managed to exist in relative peace afterwards. In many ways, this ensured their later conquest by the refugees, as they never had the need to build signiﬁcant fortiﬁcations against outside assault. This group also included intrepid Suel explorers; those bold enough to travel well beyond the bounds of Imperial authority, and charismatic enough to deal with the Flan and demi-humans they encountered. These men had explored as far the Pomarj, bringing back lightweight but valuable resources, as well as valuable information as to what lay beyond. Those who had worn out their welcome in the Suel Imperium had been ﬂeeing across the Crystalmists for centuries. Although few in number, they were just as vile as the larger groups that would follow. It was only the disorder of the Sheldomar left by Vecna that allowed them to seize what small areas they could. Their small numbers and violent racism limited their power and the number of people they Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 57 could control, with villages representing the upper limit of the settlements, and how far they could reach. But over the centuries those settlements stretched as far as the Jewel River beyond the Lortmils. The largest group came only in the last quarter century of the ﬁnal war between the Suel and Baklunish empires before the Twin Cataclysms. Some were legitimate refugees, their lands ravaged by the wars. Others were the losers in various internal conﬂicts, or disgraced military commanders, ﬂeeing to avoid the executions of their entire families. Some simply ﬂed, afraid of the losses they would suffer in the war, and hoping they could make conquests in the new lands beyond the Crystalmists at lower cost. A very few objected to the war on moral grounds. While admirable, such attitudes led to their swift destruction at the hands of the other refugees in the Sheldomar Valley. For the most part, the early Suloise migrants who came to the Sheldomar preferred to do as little as possible to build new homes. Wherever possible, they would conquer an existing settlement, enslave the survivors, and settle down to rule their new “ancestral lands.” If that was not possible, or if they lost such a battle, they would move on in an effort to ﬁnd someone less able to defend their lands than the last people. Only in the most extreme cases would they bother trying establishing new farms and plantations, carving them from the vast forests that covered the lower Sheldomar in those days. While this certainly saved time, it also outraged the people they enslaved. The Flan and demi- humans began a constant, low-level war against the invaders. This worked well for the demi-humans, and the Suel were soon barred from the woods and hills of the Sheldomar. The Flan were not as successful. Since the fall of Vecna, the old Flan tribal  associations of the region had been shattered, and they could do little to resist as wave after wave of Suel spread out across the Javan. Thousands were slain, and more thousands enslaved until the establishment of Keoland and the outlawing of slavery within its borders. Having conquered their new homes, the Suel saw to three critical elements. First, defense so they would not be expelled by the next refugees to come along. Second, to securing sufﬁcient slaves to maintain themselves in the lifestyle to which they were accustomed. And ﬁnally, to recreating the lifestyle they had enjoyed in the old Suel Imperium as best they could. Said lifestyle involving gaining more slaves, settling old scores with rival Houses, creating new ones, and engaging in magical research. All of this served to keep them weak. Unable to form alliances with the native inhabitants, unwilling to form them with their fellow refugees, they remained only as strong as their own resources could produce. As a result, most early Suel principalities were little more than the size of an average barony (about 1,000 square miles.) Some few managed to conquer a few of their neighbours, and leave enough of them alive to form “Kingdoms,” but the largest of these was less than half the size of the Duchies of Gradsul and Dorlin at the time of the founding of Keoland. Around -450 CY, Zellif, the son of Emperor Ad-Zol himself, ﬂed the Imperium. A high priest of Beltar, Zellif took with him over 8,000 fanatically loyal Suloise followers, and ﬂed the Imperium eastward after a failed palace coup. Imperator Ad-Zol diverted forces from the war in pursuit of his disloyal son, but the pursuers were never heard from again. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 58 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Zellif’s people scattered the Flannae before them, and continued north east and then south toward the Tilvanot Peninsula. One of Zellif’s minions, the High Priest Pellipardus, slipped away from the Zolites and took his minor family to the Ratik area, in the North in -443 CY . Even though Pellipardus absconded with a powerful Suel artifact, Zellif did not pursue him. Just prior to the fall of the Suel Imperium, in -424 CY, Kevelli Mauk founded the Scarlet Brotherhood in order to preserve the Suloise culture and bloodline from dilution. Mauk, his servants, and ten of his most ardent students managed to escape to the Flanaess just before disaster hit, where, after numerous travails, they joined Prince Zellif’s colony on the Tilvanot Peninsula. Slerotin’s Tunnel A ﬁnal wave of Suloise migrants entered the Flanaess after the Rain of Colourless Fire. These were actually members of a number of once-prosperous noble families and their retainers. Being on holiday at the time their civilization fell, they escaped the burning of Zinbyle, the ruined city in the Sea of Dust recently rediscovered in 570 CY by explorers from the Yeomanry. After the Rain died away, the survivors lived in barbarism, scavenging for food and stealing from the ﬂocks of goat-herders in the foothills of the bordering Crystalmists. It was in such a condition a decade after the disaster that the great wizard Slerotin, the Last Mage of Power found them, mistaking them at ﬁrst for actual savages. Slerotin heard the entreaties of the Suloise survivors, who could offer him nothing but gratitude in return for helping them cross the Crystalmists to the rich lands of the Flannae and demi-humans. Slerotin summoned his power and opened a great tunnel directly through over 70 leagues of solid rock. In this way did scions of seventeen Suloise houses enter the Flanaess with Slerotin, meeting some of their own kind who had earlier crossed the Kendeen Pass (later destroyed by a volcano) and settled along the Javan River. Among these were junior members of houses Neheli, Sus, Zelrad, Destron, Crix, Rhola, Lizhal, Malhel, Toli, Urnst, Linth, Lorinar, Salavarian, and others. An eighteenth house, the Lerara, entered late. Further delayed by a ﬁght between several nobles, the Lerara were trapped in the passage when it was sealed. After the journey through the Passage, the historian Uhas of Neheli wrote that Slerotin was “nearly consumed” and “at death’s door from his exertions.” Slerotin supposedly prophesied that the most powerful of the Suel tribes who came with him would combine with a “noble people” and found a great nation. Then he expired in a boom of thunder that levelled the nearby trees into the shape of an arrow pointing toward the future Kingdom of Keoland. The larger Houses began to seize signiﬁcant stretches of land, and expand those holdings into something approaching full sized nations. Among these were Houses Rhola and Neheli who came to settle the Sheldomar Valley and House Zelrad and Sus who found their way south of the Nyr Dyv to the eastern Flanaess. Unlike previous refugees, the Rhola and Neheli desired more than just recreating the incessant inﬁghting of the now dead Suel Imperium. They wanted to build something more, and they were willing to do what none of their predecessors had. They were willing to cooperate. First with various minor houses that had come to the Sheldomar through Slerotin’s tunnel Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 59 with them, then each other, and ﬁnally the native inhabitants that they found, primarily with the Flan and Olve. The nobles of House Rhola made for the Azure Coast, where in –368 CY they founded the city of Gradsul. While they began settling the southern coastal lands, the nobles of Neheli took their chances in the northern valleys. Their much feared Seers, who were among the few powerful apprentices of Slerotin to survive the cataclysm, closely advised the leaders of Neheli in all things. Niole Dra was founded by them within ten years of Gradsul’s creation.  The next few seasons brought many changes to the land, as the Oeridian tribes entered the Sheldomar Valley from the north. The Way In the west of Oeirk, for dozens of generations, the people of the Celestial Imperium had dwelled in peace under the protection and guidance of the Empyrean Jiao. For over a thousand years the old gods of the Suh were all but forgotten, their worship replaced with service to, and admiration of, the Celestial bureaucracy. Jiao, though not a deity, was all but a god on Oerth to the Suhfeng people and most of the Yokai and Spirit Folk of the region as well. Unlike the Flanaess or the Baklunish or Zahind lands, clerics in western Oerik rarely worship a single deity, instead worshipping the Celestial pantheon as Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 60 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. a whole.  This pantheon consists of the Celestial Emperor, Nine “Immortals” and hundreds of minor entities and spirits. Although there were rarely  famines or other causes of strife, all aspects of life were very regulated and regimented. One’s position in life is decided at birth and most Suh go on to work in the same profession as their parents.  The only exit from this fate is success in the mandarin exams. Engrained with these strict laws and rules for generations, most accepted them without question. However, humans being humans, there were bound to be some who questioned the status quo. By -2,002 CY some began to chafe at the benevolent yet strict laws that governed their lives. In that year a woman named Xan-Yae communed alone for 40 days with the Mist Dragon, Xinapheranak, who disclosed to her a new way forward for the Suhfeng people; one in which they were the architects of their own fate and not merely wards or playthings for outsiders be they demon or celestial.  Xan-Yae preached a doctrine of self-reliance and self-exploration for a release of power from within. Followers of The Way believe that reality depends upon three metaphysical ideals: the Universal Mind (the universe and all things in it exist because the mind created them and maintain them), the Perpetual Harmony (life is balanced, symmetry is in all things, achieving a similar state puts one in harmony with nature), and Internal Peace (martial and mental activities must be mastered to attain a higher level of existence). Flamboyance and wasted energy have no place in the The Way. The extremes of evil and good must be sought out and tempered with harmony to maintain balance. Clerics of the Way are agents of harmony and discipline. They seek out radical factions, alignments, and politics and bend them toward balance. They train others in the simple arts of war, hone the minds of those open to mental challenges, scour the world to ﬁnd evidence of the Universal Mind, and seek gurus of advanced physical and mental abilities for knowledge of self-elevation. They are not passive beings, but actively seek change to ensure the stability of the universe. Seeing the Celestial Empire as being out of balance, Wayists began preaching secession and rebellion within the Empire. Xan-Yae herself travelled deep into the Tyurzi Mountains where she established a monastery in the land of Be’how and there in -1,986 CY, after 364 days of uninterrupted meditation, she penned the 36 scrolls that make up the tenets of The Way and faded away in front of her disciples; Xan-Yae had achieved apotheosis. The people of Be’how, under the leadership of the High Speaker of the Way immediately seceded from the Celestial Empire and declared neutrality to all other nations, in all conﬂicts, in all times. The native Goliath population quickly took to the new faith and are today among its most devout followers. (The current High Speaker in 576 CY is a Goliath) Within a few centuries, The Way had spread across the entirety of the Celestial Empire. It took root most ﬁrmly on the edges of the Empire where several local lords began establishing their own demesnes outside the control of the Empire. Today the faith has not been outlawed within the Empire but its followers are generally looked down upon and often discriminated against by the Celestial bureaucracy. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 61 The Keogh and the Balance of Power The Oeridian migrations which had long been focussed east now began to drift south. The largest group of Oeridians that turned south from Fals Gap was an association of several smaller clans known as the Keogh. Indeed “keogh” means simply “allies” in their dialect of Old Oeridian. The clans were the Mearthe, Mandishehr, Maremehk, Blerkhaven, and Sedenna. Their power came mostly from their cavalry, which while only light cavalry by modern standards, greatly exceeded that available to anyone in the valley. Further, their horses were already of the exceptional quality that would improve over the centuries into the famous Keobred warhorses. After ﬁghting their way through the chaotic remnants of Vecna’s former center of power, they crossed the Sheldomar, and made peaceful contact with the Neheli. The Neheli gladly allowed them passage, directing them to the heartlands between the Sheldomar and Javan Rivers, hoping they would weaken some of the minor migrant Suel Houses there. This they did, but they also came into contact and conﬂict with House Linth, putative allies of the Neheli, although that was also to the advantage of the Neheli. They also came into contact and conﬂict with the Rhola, and this was deﬁnitely not to the advantage of the Neheli. As war loomed, the Neheli organized a meeting in their capital, the epic Council of Niole Dra in -342 CY. There, an alliance between the Keogh and Houses Rhola and Neheli was formed, and the Kingdom of Keoland declared. Rise of the Aerdi Perhaps the proudest, most warlike, and powerful of the Oerdian tribes were the Aerdi, their name meaning “sky people” in the old tongue. Being the strongest and largest Oeridian tribe and its leader bearing the mantle of Herzog, the Aerdy Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 62 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. led the other Oerdian tribes through the Fals Gap, where they ﬁrst encountered the Flan. Pushing ever east, the Aerdi eventually came upon the impassable barrier of an ocean. They named that vast ocean the Solnor (literally, “the birthplace of the sun”), and along its shores the petty kingdoms of Thalland and Medegia were founded shortly afterwards. Other petty empires formed, including those of Tuerny (see sidebar above). These small principalities accomplished little under their loose confederation, as they were individually unable to take on the  more powerful Flan confederations nor the nascent Suel settlements, so they quickly gathered under a single banner. Tuerny The Merciless Tuerny was born in approximately -316 CY into the Oerdian Cranden clan of the Aerdi tribe, in what is now the South Province. He became a great wizard, one of the most feared in all of history, and a counsellor to the ruler of the Aerdi principality of Thalland that preceded the rise of the Great Kingdom. As ambitious as he was, he slew his liege and the rest of the royal family, founding an expansionist tyranny in his own name. Tuerny used his magic to charm or enslave those among his generals who resisted him, and summoned demons to bolster his armies. Unfortunately, he had little control over them, and though his efforts created great terror, notoriety, and disgust, his kingdom grew little. He created his Iron Flask artifact circa -266 CY, binding within it an aspect of Graz’zt himself. As Iggwilv would do centuries later, Tuerny forced Graz’zt to aid him in his conquests but Graz’zt ultimately turned the tables on Tuerny. The demon prince transformed the warlord into a dretch, a kind of minor demon, and dragged him into the Abyss to be his slave. After centuries of indignities, manipulations and schemes, Tuerny has managed to migrate his form up the Abyssal hierarchy and is currently a vicious Nalfeshnee in the employee of an un- known Demon Prince. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 63 In –216 CY the scion of House Garasteth, Lord Mikar, became the ﬁrst grand prince. He ruled a land now called the Kingdom of Aerdy. The Aerdi made their capital in Rel Astra, and spent the next few decades conquering the neighboring Flan and driving the Suel to the south. Due to the cooperative effort of the various Aerdi tribes settling in the Flanmi basin, they expanded quickly. Grand Prince Mikar’s army won victory after victory, and by the time of his death in -175 CY, the boundaries of the Kingdom of Aerdy stretched from Relmor Bay to the Spindrift Sound and from the Blemu Hills to the Glorioles.  Thus began a march to empire that would not slow for almost 300 years. First the Aerdi conquered the crumbling kingdom in the southwest. The ancient Flan kingdom of Ahlissa was founded by the legendary Queen Ehlissa the Enchantress. This state lasted some 700 years but was crumbling by the time the Aerdi reached it in approximately -400 CY. After they conquered Ahlissa and absorbed it into the growing realm they continued on to ravage the Suel petty kingdom of Zelrad (in modern Idee) along with the lands of multiple minor Suel houses in the Pawluck Valley (modern Sunndi). Other Oeridian noble families, such as the Naelax and Torquann, desired their own territories and looked to the northlands. By all accounts, the Flan of these lands were vile and decadent, worshipping dark powers and draconian overlords, and they had preyed upon their neighbours for centuries. The gentler folk were quick to ally with the Aerdi when their armies marched up the Flanmi River and conquered those Flan kingdoms in the second century CY. Most of these lands were soon consolidated as North Province of Aerdy, with the Naelax in the primacy. After eradicating most of the vestiges of the previous Flan culture, they founded the court at Eastfair in –142 CY, and began setting up a state heavily steeped in the dogma of Hextor. Kingdom of Keoland Under the plan conceived at the Council of Niole Dra, rulership of the new Kingdom of Keoland would alternate between House Neheli and House Rhola (the other Suel houses, while part of the Kingdom, were reduced to a secondary status), while the representatives of all noble houses would meet as a permanent advisory and legislative body: the Court of the Land. Representation was set so that the Keogh would be the swing votes in critical decisions where the Neheli and Rhola were split, which, given their natures, was expected to be most of the time. The Keogh would not rule, but they would determine whose policies, the expansionist Rhola or the isolationist Neheli, would be followed. Not merely arbitrators of policy, they could also be the king makers, and the Rhola and Neheli would have to court them constantly if they wished the prestige of the Lion Throne. As a federation of allied tribes, the Keogh had an internal system similar to that which had been adopted by the Kingdom as a whole. The clans making up the Keogh were led by Hetmen, chosen from the heads of powerful families, who led their cavalry in the ﬁeld. The Hetmen would choose one of their number to speak for all of the Keogh during time of uncertain peace, but more profoundly for war. During the negotiations at the Council of Niole Dra, much time was spent deciding on the equivalent of each title, and their precedence. In the end, the Hetmen would be of higher rank than the heads of allied Suel houses and cadet branches of the main Suel Houses. The Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 64 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Hetman though would be of equal rank to the heads of House Rhola and Neheli, although he would not be considered as an eligible candidate when voting for the King. Indeed, in the oldest records of those families he is referred to with the same title as they are, Duke instead of Hetman. Less than two years after the founding of Keoland, the Neheli and Rhola had their excuse to begin eliminating the other Suel houses. It came from the Malhel, another house that had come to the Sheldomar through Slerotin’s tunnel. The House of Malhel had rejected the decisions of the Council of Niole Dra, as they would have left them in a subservient position to the Neheli. Realizing they would swiftly be destroyed if they stayed in the Sheldomar, they decided to get what they could, while they could, before ﬂeeing. This involved an assault on the Lonely Tower, a strange ediﬁce that the Neheli had found and turned into the stronghold of a new organization for those who had been the apprentices of Slerotin. They called this organization the Silent Ones, and they gave over many artifacts of power to this group for safekeeping. During the assault on the Lonely Tower the Malhel captured a number of artifacts, including the fabled Hand and Eye of Vecna. Following the attack on the Lonely Tower Nyhan I of House Rhola decided to proceed with the uniﬁcation of the valley under the banner of the new Kingdom. Called The House Wars because they were primarily directed at the various independent Suel noble houses that had established themselves in the valley before the coming of Slerotin. They were typically among the early Suel migrants, and most of them were of the worst kind of Suel: cruel and treacherous in the extreme. The new Kingdom fought not to incorporate them, but to destroy them completely, or expel them if they ﬂed quickly enough. By -336 CY House Malhel was all but wiped out with only a handful surviving, unbeknownst to their foes. These ﬂed to the Dreadwood, beyond the borders of the Kingdom, where they raised a tower called Valadis and plotted their revenge. A number of Flan clans were also subdued during this period, though many chose to ﬂee to the three main valleys of the Hellfurnaces. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 65 After a generation of relative peace, Malv the Defender resumed the House Wars and the uniﬁcation of the valley under the Lion Banner in -312 CY. By the time they ended nine years later, no signiﬁcant opposing forces were left between the Little Hills and the Lortmils, and from the Rushmoors to the Dreadwood. By this time the Malhel had come into increasing conﬂict with the Dreadwood olve over their years there. In a ﬁnal bid for power, Malhel sorcerers attempted a ritual to gain ultimate victory that instead consumed them, and scattered the few surviving members of the House to the winds. Malv’s successor Lorgyr the Seer, of House Neheli made contact with the olve of the Dreadwood around -289 CY. Although individual meetings had occurred previously, this was the ﬁrst time their rulers had met with any of the human rulers of the surrounding lands. These olven leaders had experienced the Suel Toli and Malhel houses ﬁrsthand, and were convinced that all the humans that had come with them now posed a threat to the valley. As a result of the negotiations between Lorgyr and the Dreadwood olve, a number of political changes were enacted. This included a large number of demi-humans joining the Kingdom as partners, and the founding of the Barony of Grayhill as a sign of unity. Some of the early Suel migrants pushed out by the House Wars  went east, following previous losers of battles in the Sheldomar, and settling the Pomarj (the Poor March) and Wild Coast. More went south, settling in the ﬁelds south of the Javan where they came to be ruled by the Necromancer-Pirates of House Toli, spreading hatred of the invaders who had displaced them, or crossing Jeklea Bay and trying to settle the Amedio Jungle, where they became locked in a struggle with the Olman that destroyed both peoples. Some few went further, settling the mysterious Pirate Isles further south, but little is known of them. Rise of the Great Kingdom After the conquest of Ahlissa, Aerdi rulers learned of the riches of the Iron Hills and moved immediately to forge alliance with the Dwur Kingdom of the Iron Hills. After moving forces to the northern edges of the hills and the commencement of mining operations there, the remnants of the Suel Kingdom of the Zelrad attacked resulting in a long and bloody war before the last Zelradi settlement of Karnosa was sacked and burned. The Aerdi established Zelradton as a military stronghold. By the time Grand Prince Mikar’s grandson, Nalaster, rose to power in -191 CY the dynasty had largely become effete and corrupt. Through the clever application of politics, Almor of Rauxes of House Cranden assumed the mantle of Grand Prince becoming Almor I. His son, Ferrend I added the lands of the Flan Onwi tribe who had been under the domination of Suel overlords for several generations and established the city of Scant.  Under the following Grand Prince, Ferrend II, the City of Irongate was established and complete Aerdi control of the Headlands was achieved. Onwal became a ﬁef of South Province. A pivotal event in the inexorable expansion of the Kingdom of Aerdy occurred when the Aerdi turned north west and came into contact with the ﬂedgling state of the Oeridian Nehron tribe, centered around the city-state of Rel Mord on the Duntide River.  They controlled a substantial territory up and down the Duntide from Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 66 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. the Flinties to the Gnatmarsh.  The rulers of Rel Mord were distant kin of the Aerdi house of Rax, descendants of those Aerdi clans who had not continued to the east. Their rivalry came to an end when Grand Prince Almor II of the Aerdi led his forces against the Nehron at the Battle of a Fortnight’s Length in -110 CY. It was a pivotal historical event that solidiﬁed the power of the Oeridian kingdom of Aerdy. The Oeridian hero-goddess Daern may have been present at the battle, for her mortal life is said to have ended shortly thereafter. Following this seminal battle, Grand Prince Nasran of Cranden declared “Universal Peace” and was crowned as the ﬁrst Overking of The Great Kingdom of Aerdy in Rauxes marking Year 1 of the Common Year calendar. Being a pious man, Nasran founded the See of Medegia not long after his declaration and granted it to the Church of Pholtus, entrusting the sacred heartlands of the Aerdi into sacred hands. The Overking also appointed viceroys to oversee the administration of the expanding empire. The House of Cranden was granted the Viceroyalty of the South Province, with its capital at Zelradton. The House of Naelax gained the Viceroyalty of the North Province, based in Eastfair. The viceroys had near total autonomy within their realms to efﬁciently deal with local problems, answering only to the Overking. Over the rest of Nasran’s reign and that of his son, Serran, the Aerdy armies won victory after victory. The Overking’s reach extended into what would become The Pale, the Urnst states, and the Shield Lands, and the Tenh Confederation was forced to pay tribute to avoid absorption. Nasran was by all accounts a wise and dutiful ruler, and few openly begrudged him his new title. However, it quickly became clear to all the Celestial Houses (as the major noble houses of the Aerdi had come to call themselves) that power in the Great Kingdom was being centralized in the hands of the rulers of Rauxes, and that the fortunes of the Great Kingdom would now rest with them. The needs and intrigues of the Celestial Houses would soon become subordinate to the politics of the Malachite Throne. It was the prudence of the Cranden dynasty that solidiﬁed the realm’s power structure over the next century and it continued to expand and absorb smaller tribes and nations and became a potent force for order and good in the Flanaess Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 67 now stretching from the Yatil Mountains in the west to the Solnor Ocean in the east. In the year 75 CY, Overking Tenmeris of Cranden, grandson of Nasran died. Tenmeris was widely viewed by the other Celestial Houses as a dullard who had a “brain as small as his ﬂatulent belly was vast.” It was a well known secret that his wife, Yalranda of House Nehron was the power behind the throne for at least the last decade of Tenmeris’ reign. As a formidable diplomat and mediator, Yalranda was able to manipulate the other Celestial Houses and adopted the title of Overqueen upon her husband’s death. She accepted the compromise that she take an Aerdi husband but she maintained her authority as Overqueen.  She married her counsin, Marren of House Rax who became King-Consort of the Great Kingdom. Upon Yalranda’s death in 86 CY, her son Manshen ascended the thrown as Manshen I of House Rax-Nyrond. In his ﬁrst two decades on the throne Manshen I expanded The Great Kingdom’s borders all the way to the Fals Gap and the mountainous Quaglands. The Overking divided these marklands in 100 CY, forming two vast provinces around the Nyr Dyv, one in the east and one in the west. The Viceroyalty of Nyrond, which eventually included the Suel state of Urnst, was ruled from Rel Mord by a junior branch of House Rax. A viceroy in Dyvers administered the Viceroyalty of Ferrond, including its Northern Reaches (nominally including Perrenland and lands north and northeast of the Vesve Forest). In the year 122 CY the General, Sir Pelgrave Ratik of Winetha, led an expeditionary force to push the Aerdy frontier to the foothills of the Griff Mountains. He defeated the Frutzii, who by this time resembled little of their Suel high civilization having turned to barbarism along with the Schnai and Cruskii in order to adapt and survive in their new northern homes.  Ratik drove them into the northern fastness of Timberway. He then established a fort overlooking Grendep Bay at Onsager Point that he named Marner, after one of his fallen soliders. Two years later the fortress- city of Irongate was completed to project Aerdian presence into the Azure Sea. Over the next decade the Frutzii and Schnai continued to launch a concentrated naval attack on Marner; always repelled with heavy losses by Ratik and his forces. In 130 CY the Overking of the Aerdian Empire elevated Pelgrave to Baron, and gifted him Timberway as a personal ﬁef.  The walled town of Bresht is renamed Ratikhill. Origin of the Rhenee While the other races generally trace their origins to other regions of Oerik, the Rhenee do not.  Though they rarely speak of this to outsiders, their legends claim that the race came to Oerth accidentally from their home world of Rhop. Although the Rhenn-folk have only a few ideas of what their home plane was like or how they got here, they know that it was quite different from the Flanaess. They ﬁrst appeared around the Adri Forest in 150 CY, moving west to avoid harassment by Aerdy soldiers and citizens. The Rhennee increasingly left the land to become migrants on the central rivers, until few wagon tribes exist. The majority of Rhennee now live exclusively on the waterways, making their homes on large barges capable of navigating the Nyr Dyv. Rhennee earn their living primarily through transportation of goods and passengers, with some supplemental hunting, ﬁshing, trading and craftwork. They are renowned acrobats and entertainers.

Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 69 Ryuujin Rebellion Seeing the limited success of the spread The Way had in reducing the overall power of the Celestials on Oerth, the Lords of the Nine began to put other schemes into action.  Kurutan the Red was a minor military commander from the city of Eta in the backwater Kozan Province of the Celestial Empire. Long under the inﬂuence of the Lord of the Nine, Asmodeus, Kurutan saw an opportunity to corrupt many daimyo (the Suh word for Lord) away from good and toward a more lawful evil mindset. After the secession of Minyeo and some of the other far western marches of The Empire, Kurutan began whispering sedition amongst the daimyo of his homeland in Kozan Province.  The Kozan Archipelago had long been a hinterland of the Celestial Empire having little impact on the politics of the wider empire.  The sprawling province was only nominally under the control of an Imperial Governor with the local daimyo long being left to their own devices in most things. Aided by his dark patron, Kurutan corrupted the powerful daimyo Kem Lamtun of Eta. Through diplomacy and deception, Kurutan was able to turn 8 other powerful daimyo to his cause and these eight, each guided by one of the Lords of the Nine, turned on the uncorrupted daimyo of the isles gaining supremacy by military might or the assassins blade. With the fall of the last independent daimyo in the Decimation of Lintao  in late 168 CY, the Ryuujin Empire was declared by Emperor Kem Lamtun. This act was barely noticed by the Celestial bureaucracy in Kian La. The Ryuujin Islands were redistributed to the Nine Loyal Daimyo (which included Kurutan who was elevated as daimyo of Eta). Granted an unnaturally long life, Kurutan insinuated himself  into all aspects of the government of the Empire. Within a generation Kurutan had completed Asmodeus’ plans when he manipulated the 2nd emperor Kama Lamtun into naming him Sogon, or Warlord, the supreme commander of all military forces in the Ryuujin Empire. From this point until present, the Emperor has been but a ﬁgurehead in the Ryuujin Empire. All true power is vested in the position of Sogon; one held  by descendants of Kurutan since its inception. All citizens of the Empire view the Emperor as their head of state and worship him as a near divine being. The Sogon acts on behalf of the Emperor. Those who question the Sogon’s inﬂuence on the Emperor and imperial family quickly disappear never to be seen again. Continued Aerdy Expansion After the burning of the shipyards of Pontylver  by the Suel pirates of Duxchan in 166 CY, Overking Erhart II ordered the conquest of the Duxchan Isles. Lord Admiral Aedorich of Atirr lead the armada and founded the port of Dullstrand to act as its base. When the pirates of Duxchan were ﬁnally defeated a few years later at the Battle of Ganode Bay, the survivors ﬂed to Ekul on the Tilvanot Peninsula. Sulward was founded and the Duxchan Isles became a ﬁef of the South Province, ruled by the Aerdi Prince of Diren. A generation later, in 189 CY, the northern Urnst lands were established as a protectorate by Overking Jirenen of Aerdy and reformed as the County of Urnst. Southern Urnst lords were forced to sell their holdings to the Great Kingdom, and the Duchy of Urnst was established from these lands. A few years later, Overking Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 70 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 71 Jirenen disbanded the Senate of Urnst and placed authority of southern Urnst in the hands of a Duke palatinate selected by the native Suloise nobles. By 200 CY the Landgraf of Selintan had begun building walls around the town of Greyhawk and 209 CY saw the assassination of both the Landgraf and the garrison commander of Greyhawk. The next ofﬁcer in line, Ponjes the Bull, led the “Expulsion of Evil” (the burning of evil temples and a massacre of evil cultists) Ponjes was thereafter appointed the new Landgraf of Selintan by the Overking, but instead began using the title Mayor of Greyhawk. A surge in trade in Greyhawk City followed with both the textile and meatpacking indutsries exploding in value. By this time The Great Kingdom had extended its hegemony over Hardby and annexed the burgeoning town of Verbobonc south of the Velverdyva River. In 203 CY the Order of the Knight Protectors of the Great Kingdom, which had been in existence since the ﬁrst year of the Great Kingdom, was shaken when their Lord Commander, Sir Kargoth, entered into a pact with Demogorgon, and unleashed a demonic terror upon the Great Kingdom. On midsummer 213 CY the abomination was destroyed, but Kargoth had already swayed thirteen other Knight Protectors to follow him. They became the ﬁrst of the death knights. With the death of Overking Jiranen in the spring of the same year succession became a matter of intrigue. His fatuous son Malev was uninterested in the ofﬁce and proceeded to secretly auction it off to the highest bidder among his relatives. He did not care who took the throne, and it came as some surprise when his cousin Zelcor reportedly met his price. During Zelcor’s coronation in Rauxes later that year, an ominous sign appeared in the sky, a complete eclipse of the noontime sun above the capital. The Royal Astrologers proclaimed it as a great portent, conﬁrming the sign of a coming Age of Great Sorrow prophesied by Selvor the Younger ﬁfteen years earlier. Overking Zelcor promptly abolished the astrologers’ order for trying to recreate earlier hysteria and banished the members to Rel Astra. So proceeded an inexorable decline that began as the rulers of House Rax became progressively neglectful, decadent, dimwitted or all three. Taking advantage of the new Overking’s greed and inexperience, the Mayor of Greyhawk was able to negotiate a deal whereby Aerdian troops began withdrawing the garrison from Grehawk and in year end 213 CY, Greyhawk became a Free City. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 72 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. The Age of Great Sorrow When the Aerdi came to the Flanaess, they answered a “manifest destiny” to reach the east end of the continent. Those that did established the Great Kingdom, but other Oerdian tribes driven by the Thundering Horde had come to settle the lands behind them as they migrated. The Velverdyva Valley and the region between Lake Whyestil and Woolly Bay were such places where the Oeridians quickly became the majority and this region was named after the  most successful tribe to settle: the Ferrond. Much like Keoland, the people of Ferrond exempliﬁed all that was best about the various human cultures then in the Flanaess. In those distant days, Ferrond consisted of modern-day Furyondy and the Horned Society (Ferrond tribe), Veluna (Veluni tribe of the Velverdyva), the Shield Lands, Bandit Kingdoms and Iuz (March of Northern Reaches) and Perrenland (then known as The Quaglands). The viceroy ruled fairly from Dyvers, where he was attended by scores of noble families culled from the Great Kingdom, as well as ennobled Flan who served Aerdy. Ferrond followed Aerdy’s feudalistic model, resulting in considerable proﬁt for Rauxes though creating extremely difﬁcult lives for the majority of Ferrondians. As the Aerdy empire faltered under incompetent Overkings, the nobles of Ferrond withheld their imperial tithes, ruling by their own writ more than by the commands of their distant liege. In 240 CY, the Aerdy legion was withdrawn from Verbobonc to reinforce the plains south of Whyestil Lake where several magnates were in open rebellion. This left Verbobonc in a state of administrative and political turmoil. Into this vacuum stepped the Noniz. Under the leadership of the legendary gnome adventurer Nigb Cyrbos, the city government was reorganized. Noniz artisans, merchants, and labourers ﬂocked to the city in response to Nigb’s calls for aid, and within a year the situation was stabilized. In 242 CY Nigb formally established the Viscounty of Verbobonc, encompassing most of the previously Aerdy lands in the region. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 73 Back in the Aerdi heartland, in 252 CY, Overking Toran II removed the Holy Censor of Medegia, chief administrator of the Courts, from ofﬁce, as Pholtusians fell out of favour with the House of Rax, because of the perception that the religion was attempting to curb the power of the Celestial Houses through the courts.  The new Holy Censor installed was from the priesthood of Zilchus.  Pholtusians began abandoning inner Aerdian lands around this time as a result. Two years later, the death of the aged Viceroy Stinvri of Ferrond in 254 CY signaled a change in Ferrondian politics. No longer would the nobles of Ferrond bow to the “dangerous incompetence” of Rauxes. Instead, they installed Stinvri’s heir as Thrommel I, king of Furyondy. Thrommel and his descendants had to allow their original set of vassal states independence over the following decades and centuries. Bissel was annexed for a time during Furyondy’s expansionist phase, but with the secession of Veluna, Bissel could not be retained within Furyondy’s grasp. Early in the fourth century CY the Shield Lands took form, the local rulers banding together to oppose the growing frequency of bandit raids from the northern barons and then proclaim- ing their independence. Perrenland had always been governed more in name than in practice, and was formally proclaimed independent in 400 CY. The Highfolk, always chaotic of bent, were allowed self government to the point where the Furyondian king’s authority in that land was reduced to a formality. Although the Town of Highfolk is technically a part of Furyondy, and there has never been a treaty formally proclaiming its independence, no Furyondian king would try to exercise his rulership there.  Finally, Dyvers became a Free City in 526 CY, still paying taxes and tithes to Furyondy. During these many years Furyondy was rarely engaged in warfare (the Short War with Keoland in the early ﬁfth century CY being a rare exception). With a shortage of external enemies, and given its ﬁne armies and exceptional naval strength on the Nyr Dyv and Whyestil Lake, Furyondy‘s kings felt secure in letting go of their old vassal states. Just as Furyondy freed itself from Aerdi, why shouldn’t other states become independent of Furyondy? Because of that enlightened attitude, the former vassal states generally kept warm relations with Furyondy. This was especially true of the Highfolk, and of Veluna, a growing power of good closely allied with Furyondy. Perrenlanders were suspicious of Furyondy, but knew the value of their trade route through the valley of the Velverdyva and through the fertile rivers and plains of the Kingdom. Furyondy was a better place to trade than Ket. The Shield Land nobles were an exception, always fearing a re-annexation of their lands by Furyondy. Furyondy‘s lands were ruled by seven noble houses during those early times. Six of those families survive today. When Furyondy was a great, sprawling state, the king needed powerful local noble vassals; but as decades went by and the lands shrank, the nobles kept their taste for strong local rulership and gradually they became almost as powerful as the king himself. The courts of Furyondy’s dukes and barons often rival the splendour of the king‘s. Although the nobles are all legally granted their lands by the king, they rule each of the seven provinces of Furyondy much as they please. Indeed, the king of Furyondy does not directly control any lands of his own and this would prove a source of strife and trouble for successive kings in the hard years to come. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 74 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Citing religious persecution, the migration of Pholtusians from the Great Kingdom increased as Furyondy seceded in the west.  Many refugees travelled through Nyrond to settle in the western valleys of the Rakers among the Flan in a semi-independent Flannae state. By 260 CY, the Great Kingdom had ended its opposition to Furyondy independence, although it took almost another century for the Aerdian Court of Essences to recognize Furyondian independence formally and in 283 CY Thrommel constructed the city of Chendl  and the capital was moved there from Dyvers 5 years later. Many noble and good Aerdi were expatriated by these secessions, leaving the heart of the kingdom to opportunists. Nyrond Secedes When Ferrond seceded the Overking needed soldiers to fuel violent skirmishes on the borderlands north of the Nyr Dyv. He drew from the armies of Nyrondal nobles with little concern for the ultimate futility of their charge. Thousands of Nyrond’s men and women fell in those conﬂicts. Perhaps due to incompetence from Rauxes, or perhaps because Nyrond offered a convenient scapegoat on which the Overkings could heap their frustrations regarding the loss of Furyondy, life in Nyrond was far from ideal. For a full century, the nobles of Nyrond’s junior branch looked upon the affairs of their Rax cousins with open contempt. Finally, in 356 CY, bickering between the Aerdi and Nyrondal nobles exploded into violent political conﬂict; the local lords declared Nyrond free of the Overking’s rule and named one of their own number, the wily Medven I, king of Nyrond. Every Nyrondal lord sponsored troops to an enormous gathering on the nation’s eastern border. All watched the Flinty Hills and Harp River, expecting the banners of the Overking behind every hillock. History does not speculate on whether the Suel barbarians who then surged south through Bone March and into North Province did so at the behest of Nyrond silver or by their own estimation of Aerdy’s critical situation. Regardless, they presented the sitting Overking with a difﬁcult option: crush the rebellion in Nyrond or lose the whole of North Province. When the Nyrondal princes declared the end of their allegiance to the Overking, the duke of the Tenha was persuaded to follow suit. The Battle of Redspan signaled the end of the duke’s fealty to the Overking of Aerdy. The Aerdy force was routed by the Tenha cavalry and pushed down the “Red Road to Rift Canyon” in an action made famous in the ballad of the same name. The army of the Great Kingdom was not actually swept into the Rift Canyon, as the ballad proclaims, but they were so thoroughly defeated that many of the Aerdi ofﬁcers and soldiers chose exile in the Bandit Kingdoms over the punishments awaiting them at home. Tenh’s independence brought with it renewed challenges. The Bandit Kings across the Artonsamay and Zumker rivers pushed at the duchy’s western borders, while the newly formed Theocracy of the Pale threatened their eastern border. The Rovers of the Barrens continued to raid, as always, and with greater effectiveness after their encounters with the Baklunish nomads. The duchy maintained its sovereignty in all its holdings until the rise of the outlaw Rover called Stoneﬁst. The Brazen Hoard For many centuries, the Baklunish nation of Zeif faced challenges from her Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 75 Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 76 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. neighbours on land and sea. The Zeifans were usually triumphant, yet the sea- lanes continued to grow more dangerous, as did the plains. The marauding of the Paynims became so incessant that by 290 CY, Sultan Melek II sought a permanent solution in the form of nomads from the far western steppes, beyond the Gulf of Ghayar. The Brazen Horde were a mixed Suh  and centaur nomadic nation long at odds with the Risayni, the Baklunish cousins of the Zeifans, and these horse nomads found the promise of new lands to be irresistible. Their relocation to the plains bordering Zeif was intended to provide a buffer zone between the indigenous Paynims and the lands of the sultanate, and the strategy was brieﬂy successful. Many Paynim tribes were initially displaced and forced out of their traditional ranges. These refugees initially raided through Zeif but as they crossed Zeif’s northern border, they were forced to the north and west by the combined forces of Ekbir and Tusmit which funnelled them between the Yatil Mountains and the Dramidj Ocean. They ﬁnally emerged on the great northern  steppe between the Burneal Forest and the Yatils in defeat and disarray. Yet, within a few years, they grew strong enough for their ilkhan to command the whole of the western steppes as the great Kha-Khan Ogobanuk of the Relentless Horde (c. 320 CY). The Horde were the terror of the north, from the Dramidj coast to the Griff Mountains displacing and absorbing more than one Rover band on the northern Barrens. After Ogobanuk was laid to rest in the Howling Hills, the Wolf and Tiger Nomads became separate nations, though still bound by language and tradition. Both the ilkhan and tarkhan have followed the kha-khan’s decree and studied the art of beguilement, for “any ruler who cannot deceive his enemies is not clever enough to lead a free people.” Zeif again was ravaged in retaliation in 300 CY when the Sultan failed to pay the Kha-khan of the Brazen Horde his annual pension as agreed upon.  Zeif was near bankruptcy at this point as it was recovering from the depredations of the displaced Paynims who would become the Relentless Horde. The Brazen Horde swept into Zeif from the plains and conquered Ket in 301 CY. Tusmit avoided entanglement through the judicious use of bribery but Ket was lost to the sultanate, reducing Zeif’s eastern borders to their current limits. Diplomacy proved ineffective in restoring these eastern holdings to the Padishah’s rule, and several expensive military disasters caused the government of Zeif to abandon efforts to regain these lands. The bey of Lopolla claimed the Brazen Horde as his allies and was allowed to remain in ofﬁce, but the nomads conceded authority only to their great Kha-Khan. From here the Brazen Horde swarmed past Thornward in late 301 CY, and threatened both Veluna and the northern part of Dorlin in Keoland. Aribok, the Kha-khan of the Brazen Horde was killed in combat while besieging the Velunese town of Hadrian on the Fals River in 303 CY.  Upon his death, the Horde fractured into numerous warbands. Many of these rampaged over the western Flanaess for another generation causing trouble for nations and nobles from Keoland to the Shield Lands. Others opted to return to the Dry Steppes raiding through Zeif once again while a minority actually opted to settle and merged with the local Baklunish population in Ket. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 77 Ryuujin Empire Expands Inﬂuenced as they had been for generations by ﬁends of the Nine Hells, the daimyo of the Ryuujin Empire had warred and fought amongst themsleves since the Empire’s inception.  Each daimyo secretly mentored by a Lord of the Nine with the Sogon pulling the strings in most circumstances. In 351 CY Sogon Otomi sought an outlet for his warlike lords and ushered in Ryuujin’s expansionist period. In that year Otomi launched what would end up being the ﬁrst of two invasions of Minyeo, with the intent of conquering that nation and eventually the Celestial Empire. Initially, the Ryuujun forces saw overwhelming success on land, capturing both Sulan, the capital of Minyeo, and Yangkun, and completing the occupation of large portions of the nation in three months. The Ryuujin forces, well trained, conﬁdent, and experienced after the numerous battles and conﬂicts on their home islands, typically held the ﬁeld in most land engagements. Normally unconcerned with events on the fringes of the Empire, Celestial Emperor Jiao quickly interpreted the Ryuujin invasions as a challenge and threat to Celestial rule. The celestial’s interest was also to keep the war conﬁned to Minyeo and out of its own territory; they entered into the conﬂict by dispatching reinforcements to attack from the south. This success on land, however, was constrained by the naval campaigns of the Minyeon navy which would continue to raid Ryuujin supply ﬂeets in its coastal waters, hampering the Ryu advances as supply lines were disrupted along the northern Minyeon coast and Ryu naval reinforcements were repelled. These trends, with some exceptions on both sides, held true throughout much of the conﬂict. In the engagements that followed, the majority of the Minyeon army was focused on defending the northern provinces from Ryuujin offensives, while also supporting Celestial army campaigns to recapture territory occupied by the Ryu in the south. Consequently, it was the combination of these celestial-led land campaigns and Minyeon-led naval warfare that eventually forced Otomi’s army to withdraw from Yangkun to the Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 78 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. south. The Ryu continued to hold what they captured in the north. Afterwards, with supply difﬁculties hampering both sides, neither the Ryu nor the combined Celestial and Minyeon forces were able to mount a successful offensive or gain any additional territory, resulting in a military stalemate in the areas between Seong and Kaeseong. The war continued in this manner for ﬁve years, and was followed by a brief interlude between 357 CY and 362 CY during which Otomi and the Celestials engaged in ultimately unsuccessful peace talks. In 363 CY, Otomi renewed his offensive by invading Minyeo a second time. The pattern of the second invasion largely mirrored that of the ﬁrst. The Ryu had initial successes on land, but the contribution of the Celestial forces, as well as the Minyeon navy’s disruption of Ryu supply ﬂeets, resulted in a withdrawal of Ryuujin forces towards the coastal regions. The pursuing Celestials and Minyeon forces, however, failed to dislodge the Ryu from their fortresses and entrenched positions in the northern coastal areas where both sides became locked in a ten-month long military stalemate. With Otomi’s death in Patchwall 364 CY, limited progress on land, and continued disruption of supply lines along the western and southern coasts by the Minyeon navy, the remaining Ryuujin forces in Minyeo were ordered to withdraw making the old capital of Sulan as their new colonial headquarters. Everything north of Sulan became Ryuujin territory.  While they lost their capital, the Governor of Free Minyeo moved his government to the city of Seong but his control now extends little beyond the Minyeo headlands themselves. This state of detente continues to 576 CY. Imperial Keoland In 286 CY, Gillum the Mad sat on the Lion Throne of Keoland. His family, the House of Neheli, had held the throne for more than two hundred years. During that time they led the Kingdom through an artistic and technological renaissance, taking the Kingdom to new cultural heights. What they neglected was expansion. So many areas close to the Kingdom holding incredible wealth were ignored. Alliances that could have been made were spurned. Enemies that could have been eliminated were allowed to rebuild. While the Kingdom stood strong even as the Great Kingdom collapsed, it remained fragile, and had the Great Kingdom lasted another quarter century, or the Brazen Horde come a score of years earlier, the Kingdom would have been vulnerable. Into this stepped Tavish Vilchar Rhola. When Gillum was removed from the throne by a Court unwilling to see him destroy the Kingdom in his madness, the only choice to replace him was the young Duke of Gradsul. Even before becoming King Tavish I, he had reached out, expanding his Duchy south, rebuilding the ports between Gradsul and the Hool Marsh to use as bases against the resurgent Lords of Toli. And he had made a friend of the young Olinstaad Corond of the Lortmils Dwur. Sharing a vision, they both looked to build an empire of man and demi-human. Tavish the Great’s political victories were his ﬁrst and last. In 292 CY he signed the treaties that brought the Ulek states into the Kingdom, a mere ﬁve years after he became King. In that, he was helped greatly by Olinstaad Corond. The demi- humans of the Lortmils had long had close ties, and typically acted in concert. They were also long dominated by Celene, and as the third century drew to a close, Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 79 most of them had become fed up with the arrogant attitude of the Gray Olve rulers of that realm. It was enough that when Corond brought them the pledges of Tavish, and his intentions of working with the human, those living in the peaks and on the western slopes agreed to join him. That Tavish and Corond had already cooperated in building Stoneheim in the Drachensgrabs, as well as Corond’s new capital at Gryrax, made it little more of a formality for the Principality of Ulek to join, but it served to show the others that Tavish was committed to working with them. When he also agreed to cede the eastern ﬁefs of both his family and the Neheli to the new provinces, they saw his further commitment to a long and binding alliance. That his relative was recognized as Count Palatine of Ulek mattered little, as the Noniz and Hobniz of that region had long had good relations with that branch of the Rhola family. The High Olve of the new Duchy of Ulek were also pleased to have their independent power recognized by someone, if not the haughty Gray Olve of Celene. Still, the greatest gift the alliance brought to them was Keoish troops to help guard the passes of the Lortmils, and the entrances to the Underoerth that honeycombed them. Controlling the humanoid hordes that dwelled beneath them was a constant drain on the long lived, slow breeding demi-humans, and the military aid provided a great boost to their countries. His second political victory was the last to expand the Kingdom under him. In 316 CY his representatives in the County of Hochoch signed an agreement with the independent Flan tribal nation of Gyreff of the upper vales, creating the March of Geoff, and bringing them into the Kingdom centuries after Sterich and the Yeomanry had been incorporated. The conﬂicts with the rulers of Hochoch had delayed the expansion for too many years during the years before the Slumbering, and the Neheli had no interest in pursuing the political missions necessary during the Slumbering. Finally incorporating it meant that the whole of the Sheldomar Valley, Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 80 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. from the Hellfurnaces and Crystalmists to the Lortmils, from the Fals Gap to Jeklea Bay, were ﬁnally united under the Lion Banner. In eleven short years, the Pomarj, Bissel, and what is now the Hold of the Sea Princes all fell to his armies. And in each case, he used the same tactic. First he built a city, Thornward in 289 CY, Stoneheim in 291 CY, and Monmurg in 301 CY. Each controlled valuable trade in the area, and to each he invited the various nobles of the Kingdom to send their family merchant companies to share in the proﬁts that ﬂowed in. Then as soon as a crisis broke out, he used their support to secure the areas through conquest to safeguard their new wealth. The ﬁrst, in Stoneheim, came from a minor incident with a trade caravan passing through the holding of one of the minor lords living in the region. Those nobles were all early Suel migrants, refugees from the House Wars who went far enough to avoid being hunted down. They had enjoyed the wealth of the Drachensgrabs for centuries, and while decadent, had little desire to give it up. But that was all the excuse Tavish needed. With heavy infantry provided by Corond, he sent his family troops marching into the Pomarj. Within three years they were swept away. Those nobles that had sent troops to assist in the conquest were rewarded with some of the new ﬁefs created there, though the whole was made subject to Prince Corond. The second conquest was in Bissel. In 301 CY, as Tavish was overseeing the founding of Monmurg, the Brazen Horde swept through Ket and into the Fals Gap. The trade through the Fals Gap, from Baklunish west, Ferrondian east, and Keoish south provided fabulous wealth. And after seeing the rewards doled out in the Pomarj, nobles were nearly ﬁghting to be in on the new conquest. As a result, the Brazen Hoard was expelled within the year, and Tavish attached the new area to the Gran March, charging a refocussed Knights of the Watch to ensure the Suh Horde and their Baklunish allies did not return. The speed of that conquest was critical, as the next war began a year later in 303 CY. The Lords of Toli, threatened by Keoish ships sailing to the Amedio from Monmurg, declared war, but by then it was too late. With Monmurg as a base, and the war in Bissel ended, and nobles still eager for new lands, Tavish raised his third army and marched south. It was then he engaged in probably the most legendary of his military feats. Marching through the Hool Marsh, he completely avoided the ships of the Toli besieging Monmurg. He then raised Westkeep, giving him control of the Javan River as it ﬂowed through the Hool Marsh. Able to bring supplies in by this route, his army marched overland, raising the siege of Monmurg, then storming Toli, ending a rivalry that began 460 years previous with his ancestor Sanduchar the Navigator. With Toli taken, the ﬂeet had nowhere to resupply, and those who did not ﬂee the region were hunted down and destroyed. Afterwards, Tavish made Monmurg a Duchy, and hoped his heirs would use it as a base to expand into the Amedio. Following the death of Tavish the Great in 346 CY, the throne was taken by his eldest son, Tavish II (called “The Blackguard”), a move that was grudgingly approved by the Council of Niole Dra. During the early summer of 348 CY, the new king made his so-called “Wealsun Proclamation”, over the objections of the members of the Council. In it, he asserted the manifest destiny of the Keoish to hegemony over the Sheldomar Valley and all its borders. Within a handful of years, Keoland had Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 81 marched armies into western Veluna and annexed the Pomarj from the prince of Ulek. Using the added support he gained from early victories in the Kingdom of Veluna, Tavish II quickly drove the ill-prepared rulers of Ket to the Tusman Hills. In late 362 CY, he ordered the extension of a formal trade road from Thornward to Molvar and eventually to Lopolla. Earlier the previous year, the Yeomanry had closed its borders to the Keoish, withdrawing its forces in protest against the “wars of aggression,” while Celene expelled royal garrisons from within its borders and the Kettite expedition began unravelling within a few years. The disorder caused by the mutinying Yeomen delayed the start of the road being built from Thornward to Molvar and Lopolla, and so gave the Kettites a chance to rise up. For the next thirty seven years they would ﬁght a brutal campaign to liberate themselves from Keoish rule, the Knights of the Watch becoming increasingly savage as the campaign progressed, as two generations of the best of the Baklunish west and Keoish south fought and died for a forsaken cause. The collapse of the campaign in Ket also led to the collapse of Tavish the Blackguard and his legacy. He ended his reign a bitter, resentful old man, cursing the world that had given him a father too great for anyone to match up to. End of Keoish Imperialism With the death of Tavish the Blackguard, the Keoish Court of the Land refused to acknowledge his infant son as King. Instead, they selected Nemonhas of Neheli. But in an unprecedented act, he spurned the crown, and declared he would join the Silent Ones. The Court was thrown into chaos, as no one could convince him to return, and the Neheli refused to sanction his removal. Finally, Luschan Sellark, son of the general who had taken Devarnish, stepped forward and forged a compromise among the factions. He was named Regent, with a promise of ending the wars, and rejecting any future plans of conquest. He was as good as his work, completing the withdrawal from Ket in ﬁve years. And with that withdrawal, he split Bissel from the Gran March, setting it up under the rule of a secular noble with an eye on trade rather than conﬂict with the Baklunish. He also ended the conﬂict with the Yeomen, and began a diplomatic initiative to woo them back. Unfortunately, while his political policies were achieving the goals he desired, his personal affairs were deteriorating at an even more rapid pace. He had taken in the son of Tavish the Blackguard, Luschan Vilchar, and was raising him with his own son, Malv Sellark. But as the two reached adulthood, it was clear there would be a conﬂict between them for who would follow Luschan as ruler of Keoland. Each had their supporters and detractors. Luschan was favoured as the “true” heir, but tainted by the deeds of his father. Malv was favoured as the son of the regent, but many feared he hid a madness worse than that of Tavish the Blackguard. And regrettably, they were correct, and fear of a memory overcame caution for what was present, including the rumours that he had hastened the election that raised him to the throne. Luschan the Regent held the throne for nineteen years before what many felt was a premature death. His son Malv was elected King, though he chose to rule as Tavish, third of the name, called the Boy King for his youthfulness. He revealed himself almost immediately, Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 82 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 83 appointing the near-psychotic Berlikyn Commandant of the Northern Marches, which incorporated Gran March, Bissel, and Devarnish. Berlikyn had one mission, squeeze the people of those territories for every silver piece, and squeeze the merchants passing through even harder until wars with Veluna and Ket were inevitable. Berlikyn took to the task with glee, using the Knights of the Watch as his primary tool. Under him, their reputation sank even lower, until few regarded them as anything but night riding thugs. Within Keoland itself, Tavish III demanded greater and greater taxes to fund the army he hoped to unleash to ﬁnish the conquest of Veluna. His demands, and the excesses of Berlikyn drove the Olve, Noniz, and Hobniz of the Uleks to near revolt, and alienated everyone not bound to him by positions of power they had received from his hand to near revolt. All they needed was a leader, and in 433 CY, his own foster brother, Luschan V, Duke of Gradsul, acted to become that leader. Staging his disappearance within the Amedio, he began to organize forces, subverting the majority of the ﬂeet (an easy task as he was Admiral of Keoland), and preparing for civil war. He began slowly, seeming to be a mere pirate plaguing the Jeklea Bay at ﬁrst. But before he could make his move, Tavish, ﬁnally freed of his opposition in court, unleashed Berlikyn. The result was the disaster known as the Short War. While the initial assault into Veluna in 436 CY achieved some success, Furyondy quickly came to the aid of Veluna, and by 438 CY they had not only pushed the Keoish forces out of Veluna, but had taken Bissel. Tavish was forced to cede both, and with the death of Berlikyn he had to agree to let the nobles of Gran March elect their own Commandant. As the Kingdom reeled from the ﬁrst real loss in an external war, Luschan, known as the Sea Prince, began overrunning the March of Monmurg, taking Port Toli and Monmurg, and closing the Jeklea Bay to merchants from Keoland. His ships began to harry merchants throughout the Azure Sea, and he issued a direct challenge to his foster brother. But as the campaign began, Tavish was distracted by events in Geoff. Discovering that the Royal Herald sent there during the Short War to demand reinforcements had been murdered, he diverted half of his army, under the command of his son and heir Luschan VI, to Gorna, to avenge the insult. The action drove the Margrave of Geoff to declare for Luschan the Sea Prince, and civil war now consumed the entire Kingdom. In the south, the ﬁnal act was being carried out. Tavish marched his army across the Hool Marsh, losing thousands to disease along the way, to meet his foster brother at Westkeep. Responding to taunts, he led an attempt to storm the walls, and died before them, his body trampled in the mud, as the man he played with as a child looked down from the battlements, and ordered a counterattack. With the death of Tavish, the Boy King, the Kingdom was on the brink of collapse. The Court rejected all overtures of Luschan the Sea Prince, and demanded he lay down his arms and submit to judgement. The Neheli wished to make the disgrace of the Rhola complete, and so allowed the election of the younger son of Tavish III, the fourth and last Tavish to rule Keoland, called the Weary for the thankless tasks the Court set him. Tavish IV was given one command, and told to fulﬁl it without limit. He was to make peace, at any cost. And he did so. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 84 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. In 460 CY he negotiated the separation of the Uleks from Keoland. (The Pomarj declared independence from the Prince of Ulek two years later.) In 461 CY he made the separation of the Yeomanry law as well as fact. Through the early 460s he began the construction of a line of forts intended to secure the Hool Marsh in an attempt to make the war with his uncle end in a stalemate. However, peace would come there in another way. In 464 CY, leading a ﬂeet, Tavish the Weary met the ﬂeet of Luschan the Sea Prince off Jetsom Island. Despite Luschan having been known as the greatest Admiral since Malv the Explorer, his ﬂagship went down as night approached to end the day long battle, ending the Keoish Civil War although Keoish forces were never able to regain hegemony over much of the southern lands. Tavish the Weary would live for twenty four years after the Battle of Jetsom Island, his reign ﬁlled with little more than rubber stamping the declarations of the Court, and mourning his shattered family and empire. Turmoil Between Crowns While some Overkings had been less than masters of warfare or diplomacy, the House of Rax produced a succession of inept rulers. Galren, Portillan’s son, was a half-wit. In turn, Galren’s son and heir, Sonnend, was a drunkard who left all affairs of state to his advisors. Further ineffectual and weak rulers followed their dismal reigns. Some were said to be insane, but this was mostly untrue—save for feeble-mindedness now and again. This produced a vital change in Aerdi society. Local rulers who were members of other royal houses began to use their titles of prince rather more aggressively. They began to enact more laws of their own, to administer local taxes increasingly independently of the Overking, to build fortiﬁcations not only for themselves but for their own leigemen who came less and less to answer to the Overking and more and more to obey only their own local lords. Mercenary armies became more common, and some princes conquered slices of other princes’ lands. The drunken, enfeebled, or effete Overkings allowed this to happen. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 85 The House of Naelax was the ﬁrst to use humanoid mercenary troops around the Adri Forest for provisioning raids late in the fourth century. And it was this royal house which came increasingly to the fore. At this time, the Great Kingdom still had a relative freedom and equality of many priesthoods, although those of law and order were dominant. In Rauxes itself, the priesthood of Pholtus still played a commanding role as advisers, judges, and mediators. However, Naelax aligned itself ﬁrmly with the burgeoning priesthood of Hextor. In a land with increasing strife and struggle, this aggressive, evil priesthood became more inﬂuential as the decades passed. Before many years went by, Prince Ivid of Naelax acted decisively to oust the wretched Rax ruler. The Turmoil Between Crowns is the name given both to the decade of internal schisms under the rule of the last Rax Overking, and to the civil war which followed Ivid’s ascension. Overking Nalif was the last of the Rax line descended directly from the Overkings. A ﬂock of misbegotten cousins, exiles and ne’er-do-wells of Rax could lay some claim to the title of Overking when Ivid had Nalif assassinated, but after a century of hopelessly ineffectual Rax rule all of the royal houses agreed that another Rax Overking was simply unacceptable. Ivid proclaimed himself Overking immediately (in 446 CY) and plunged the Great Kingdom into civil war. With few exceptions, no simple picture of the role of royal houses in the civil war can be given. Most of the House of Naelax allied with Prince Ivid. But a few of his cousins—who disliked and distrusted him—did not. Among the competing houses, the House of Cranden opposed Naelax, as did many elements of the House of Garasteth and the remnants of Rax. But in all houses princes were busy using the civil war as a cover for settling old scores and attacking their in-house rivals. Ivid certainly had some such princes assassinated; the blame would be laid upon their own blood for this, increasing within-house divisions and making opposition to him less organized. Alliances shifted during the war, but the decisive event was the decree of the House of Darmen in CY 449 to back Ivid’s suit wholeheartedly. This wealthy and pragmatic house believed Ivid was coming out ahead, so the house sprang a surprise with the sack of Rel Deven in Harvester of that year and a series of brilliant lightning strikes aimed at securing provisioning for the coming winter. Their armies allied with those of Naelax to secure the central lands of the Great Kingdom, and the war was won. In Planting, CY 450, all houses agreed to accept Ivid as Overking, and their leading princes paid homage along the Great Way in the Parade of Crowns. The House of Naelax was triumphant. Ivid may have won a kingdom, but he paid a high price. The South and North Provinces, and Medegia, became in effect semi-autonomous provinces of the Great Kingdom. Ivid had to accept this as part of the bargain for accepting his ascension to the throne. While North Province was ruled by the House of Naelax, Medegia in particular became increasingly independent and often failed to support the more aggressive schemes of later Overkings. But the independence of these sub-states could only delay the ﬁnal fate of the Aerdi. The House of Naelax changed Aerdy forever. The ﬁve Overkings it produced, and most of its noblemen and women, were Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 86 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. dangerously insane and “ﬁend-seeing.” Dangerously insane because the typically paranoid form their madness took did not take any toll of their intellect; they were usually smart, piercingly observant, especially with ﬁendish aid, and utterly ruthless. The title “ﬁend-seeing” ascribed so often to them is, nowadays, not such an unusual aspect of Aerdi. Many rulers trafﬁc with ﬁends or have ﬁends in their armies. However, at the time, the House of Naelax assumed dominance by being very unusual and pre-eminent in such fell dealings, and it gave them a decisive edge. The Iron League Forms Long-standing pressures upon South Province to bring the southern ﬁefs into line drove Damalinor of Naelax, the new herzog appointed by Ivid, to attempt to break the rebellion with an infamous act of villainy. In 446 CY, the lord mayor of Irongate petitioned to have his grievances heard in Zelradton and accepted an invitation to attend the herzog at his palace. When he and his party arrived, they were imprisoned and tortured to death for the Overking’s entertainment. Their remains were on display for weeks in the Traitor’s Garden in Rauxes. So horriﬁed were the people of Irongate by the account of the mayor’s demise that the city revolted against the herzog and the Overking. South Province was plunged into civil war and chaos. Aerdy garrisons and ofﬁcers were expelled from much of the region by the end of 447 CY, with only the core of South Province, that region called Ahlissa, left in imperial control. In response, Herzog Damalinor declared open season on the rebellious states. He targeted Irongate in particular as the keystone of the rebellion. He called up a force composed of hundreds of his vassals and kin (most of whom were landless, errant knights) and as bounty, he offered them a piece of the conquered states as spoils. So numerous were the so- called “privateers” and their men- at-arms that the ensuing siege of Irongate would be called the Battle of a Thousand Banners. However, the force was stymied by the success of the kingdom’s own design of the fortress-city. Irongate was impregnable, designed to withstand siege and repel invaders like no other city. The herzog’s commanders failed to quickly penetrate the city, and the Provincial Expeditionary Force was slaughtered by a combined host of men, olves, and dwurs; the surviving invaders were hunted down in the Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 87 hills and slain over the next few weeks. Word of the success of Irongate’s defense quickly spread, and a great conference was called in the city, including representatives of other various rebellious states once a part of, or governed, by the vast South Province. Irongate, Onnwal, Idee, Sunndi, and the Lordship of the Isles declared independence from the Great Kingdom, witnessed by ambassadors from Nyrond and dwarf nobles from the Glorioles, Hestmark Highlands, and Iron Hills. This was followed by the formation of the Iron League by Irongate, Onnwal, and Idee in late 447 CY. With chaos and madness ruling from Rauxes, Nyrond’s King Dunstan I knew that no enemy of Aerdy would ever be safe again. Nyrond, he noted, needed allies, and it needed them quickly. By 450 CY, Aerdy had survived two distinct civil wars. Ivid and his court had defeated their enemies in the aristocracy, and had entrenched themselves in the empire’s political machine. With a stabilized foe, Dunstan realized in his old age that he still needed willing allies, should Aerdy take the offensive. In Harvester, he called the Great Council of Rel Mord. Delegates from every Nyrondal principality and subject state attended, as did representatives from Almor, the Iron League, the Duchy of Urnst, and even Greyhawk. After a month and a half of negotiation, Dunstan the Crafty withdrew Nyrondal troops from the Pale and the County of Urnst, and realigned the internal borders of his subject lands. Furthermore, he publicly threw his considerable support behind the Iron League, and rebuked the Great Kingdom of Aerdy as a “corpulent reanimated corpse, spreading contagion and sorrow to all that it touches.” Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 88 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Thereafter, Nyrond entered a period of supremacy. Castle-building programs dotted the central plains with fortiﬁcations, cities expanded, and commerce boomed. The nation gained a reputation for powerful mages and skilful artisans. As evil grew in the east, Nyrond became a reﬂection of the good folk of the eastern Flanaess. The Witch Queen: Iggwilv Iggwilv is said to have once been named Natasha, and it is under this name that she was “adopted” as a child by the Hag- witch Baba Yaga. Under Baba Yaga’s tutelage, Natasha grew into a talented spellcaster, and soon became known as “Natasha the Dark,” perhaps in contrast to another adopted daughter of Baba Yaga, Iggwilv’s “sister,” Elena the Fair. Iggwilv next appeared in Ket some 300 years ago, in the 3rd century CY, where she was known as Hura. After being driven from Lopolla for plundering the Vault of Daoud (where it is assumed she acquired Daoud’s Wondrous Lanthorn), Hura made her way to the Free City of Greyhawk. Now using the name Tasha, Iggwilv encountered the wizard Zagig Yragerne, who quickly (and scandalously) took her on as an apprentice. Sometime during this period (early 4th century CY), Tasha also served as a member of the Company of Seven, Zagig’s adventuring band, and developed the spell Tasha’s Hideous Laughter. Zagig and Tasha’s relationship culminated in the imprisonment of the demon lord Fraz- Urb’luu. When Zagig was unaware, Tasha spoke to the imprisoned demon lord, and learned many secrets. Shortly thereafter, Iggwilv absconded with many of Zagig’s magical tomes, including the Tome of Zyx, which she would later make additions to and rename The Demonomicon. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 89 Iggwilv travelled to the Yatil Mountains, in the unclaimed wilderness near the Velverdyva River, to a twisted mountain now called Iggwilv’s Horn, said to be the last resting place of the ancient mage Tsojcanth. There, using the lore and power she had stolen from Fraz-Urb’luu and Zagig, she bound Tsojcanth to her service, using him as her slave for generations. Iggwilv next appears in the historical records of Perrenland in 460 CY. Using what she had learned (and stolen) from Zagig, Iggwilv summoned and imprisoned the demon lord Graz’zt. She managed to seduce the demon lord into helping her with her plans of conquest and went on to bear him a son, Iuz. In 480 CY, she assembled an army and attacked Perrenland from her base in the Yatils known as the Lost Caverns. Iggwilv’s conquest of Perrenland was complete by 481 CY and she held a ﬁrm grip on that nation until 491 CY, when Graz’zt escaped her control. Graz’zt had suggested, maliciously, that Iggwilv bind Tsojcanth to use as a living seal against the alarmingly spreading rift to the Abyss beneath Iggwilv’s Horn. Iggwilv was caught off guard when Tsojcanth fought back for the ﬁrst time in years. Weakened by the battle, she was doubly unable to resist Graz’zt’s subsequent attack of his own. Iggwilv herself was forced to battle Graz’zt, just barely managing to slay his earthly form, banishing him to the Abyss. Iggwilv was left shattered and powerless, enabling the native Perrenlanders to defeat her forces and regain their nation. After the loss of Perrenland, little was heard from Iggwilv for decades, and for a short while, she was presumed dead. Rise of Iuz Iuz was conceived around 460 CY, shortly after his mother Iggwilv imprisoned the demon lord Graz’zt. He ﬁrst came to prominence in 479 CY, when the handsome youth gained control of a petty ﬁef in the Howling Hills. Ostensibly beholden to Furyondy; in practice it was independent. It had been left to Iuz upon the death of his “father,” a human ruler who had supposedly claimed that Iuz was his son. Almost immediately, Iuz transformed his estate into an armed camp, and began cultivating alliances with the other local lords. Using cunning and guile, Iuz manipulated his “allies” against one another and against stronger opponents, weakening all of the cambion’s rivals. Slowly Iuz’s forces increased in size as humans and euroz gathered under the banner of the Child of the Evil One. The humans cared little for the orcs, but they liked how their opponents feared the euroz shock troops. Jebli, similarly, began rallying to his cause as well. By 480 CY, Iuz had earned the title Lord of Pain as his conquest began against Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 90 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. his weakened neighbours. The atrocities he committed during these early campaigns made it clear to all who witnessed those battles that whoever his parents were, Iuz certainly had no humanity. Before long, Iuz controlled three neighboring ﬁefs in addition to his original one. King Avras III of Furyondy called his southern nobles for aid against the warlike upstart, but the nation fell into internal squabbling and in the end did nothing to restrain the cambion’s ambitions. Iuz’s true mother Iggwilv was conquering Perrenland at the same time, but she found time to aid her son with her magic. Iuz, as a marquis cambion, had magic of his own that he used to great effect in intimidating his followers and enemies. Soon Iuz’s capital of Dorakaa had become a charnel house, with a road made from the skulls of the young leader’s enemies leading up to it. Watchtowers built along the road by chained slaves were used to burn the living ﬂesh of prisoners en masse. By 500 CY, Iuz had conquered the westernmost Bandit Kingdoms and named the city of Molag his “summer capital.” As far away as the Principality of Ulek, contingency plans were drawn up in case Iuz should invade. In 491 CY, Iuz was present at his mother’s court when his father Graz’zt made his bid for freedom. Iggwilv had, at Graz’zt’s suggestion, decided to use her pet ﬁend Tsojcanth to seal an ever- growing hole leading to the Abyss. Tsojcanth rebelled unexpectedly, and as Iggwilv was recovering from his attack, Graz’zt attacked as well. Caught between the uncontrolled magic of both his parents, Iuz was inadvertently split into his human and ﬁendish halves. From then on, Iuz’s once-handsome visage resembled a withered old manikin or a bloated, bestial-faced demon. He took the former form when he wished to put his supplicants at ease, and the latter when he wished to intimidate his foes. Although Graz’zt was ultimately banished, Iggwilv’s powers were exhausted by the melee, and she retreated to other worlds to recover. Without his mother’s magic, the progress of Iuz’s empire slowed, though it did not stop. Iuz began the process of transforming himself into a deity, gathering powerful wizards or extra-planar beings beneath the Soul Husks Caverns in the Howling Hills. With horriﬁc magics, he drained them of their power, incorporating them into his own being. He also cultivated an alliance with Zuggtmoy, the demon queen of fungi, laying the foundations of what would become the Temple of Elemental Evil. The rise of Iuz was not noted by Furyondy for some years, but as refugees ﬂed to the northern provinces of Crystalreach and Kalinstren the tales they told were so terrible that eventually they had to be attended to. These refugees spoke of massacres, a road of skulls built to Dorakaa, watch-towers belching smoke, ﬁre and acid into which slaves disappeared by the score. Such horrors made the northern nobles, and the king, shiver. The Hateful Wars Aptly named, this war was nothing less than an attempt to exterminate the humanoids of the Lortmils, once and forever. As such, it was a failure, as it only resulted in the humanoids escaping and re-grouping in the Pomarj. Each of the lands around the Lortmils claimed the leadership role during the war, and each graciously acknowledged the limited role played by the others. Truth be told, no one race or land held the predominant role. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 91 Although the dwur in their citadels had planned this war of extinction since the ﬁrst stone of the ﬁrst stronghold was cut and placed, they did not have the force of numbers to drive out the humanoids, even with the assistance of their noniz allies. Realizing this, they turned to the humans and noniz of the lowlands, breaking their long isolation. Even the olves of Celene were contacted, although the meetings were frosty and often in danger of falling apart due to racial tensions. The dwarves were conﬁdent of an easy victory—they had spent patient centuries mapping passages in the deeper mines, and were the most familiar with the locations of the jebline citadels. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 92 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. However, when ﬁghting ﬁnally began in 498 CY, the dwur found that their maps constantly led them into traps and ambushes. There are also rumours that during the years of battles, magical forces of unknown origin constantly deﬂected or distracted those of the olves. Humanoid warbands would appear as if out of thin air to strike unlikely targets in the lower elevations, and vanish before a retaliatory force arrived. Elven and human wizards attempted to scry the plans of their opponents but found they were blocked, or worse, that a false vision would be gained. It was clear that the humanoids had magical assistance far surpassing the ability of their shamans and witch- doctors. Olven chroniclers hypothesized that one of the elder liches of Oerth, such as Lerrek of the Vesve, could have lent assistance to the cause of the humanoids. They discounted any possibility of the participation of a goblinoid avatar, as they held ﬁrm to the belief that should their foe have such a powerful ally, that their own Powers would have alerted them of the danger. They also doubted that it was simply a mortal mage, for the sheer intricacy and skill of the defenses encountered. After years of futile effort, the magical onslaughts of the olves ﬁnally broke through whatever magical defense had shielded the humanoids, and the route was on. Citadel after citadel was left populated only by dead goblinoid warriors. The shamans, realizing their imminent defeat, urged a massive break-out attempt to escape the encircling humans and demi- humans. Some tribes, as noted by others, attempted to ﬂee into the Yatils and were caught and destroyed. The vast majority of the tribes raced through the tunnels of the southeastern Lortmils, towards the Pomarj. A diversionary force was sent to besiege the city of Jurnre in 506 CY in the hopes that any pursuit would be thrown off the main body. The tactic worked— enough of the Ulek forces abandoned their positions in the foothills to defend the city that the humanoid army was able to sweep through without serious resistance and overrun the Pomarj. The ﬁnal chapter has yet to be written on this subject; even now it is rumoured that the latest war leader, Turrosh Mak, is once more attempting to forge the tribes into a united force, and the humanoids again have magical support. Items such as the Goblin Shield of the Pomarj are beyond the power of their shamans to construct, yet this is only a sample of the new power ﬂowing into the hands of the humanoids. The Godtrap In 505 CY, Iuz was captured by the wizard Zagig Yragerne and his allies. Along with eight other demigods, he was incarcerated in Zagig’s Godtrap beneath Castle Greyhawk until released by Lord Robilar in 570 CY. In the cambion’s absence, several “false Iuzs”—illusionists, demons, and demodands with delusions of grandeur—began dividing the empire between them. Further south, the landholders of Iuz’s former lands dedicated themselves to the worship of Nerull, Anthraxus, and the Lords of the Nine. Iuz’s disappearance was met with a sigh of relief in Furyondy. The current king, Belvor II, was all too happy to forget about the ﬁend. In the meantime, the euroz of the northlands had named him the Old One, and their worship helped increase the demigod’s power. Loyal and opportunistic humans joined the cult, and soon some were rewarded with clerical powers in spite of their patron’s imprisonment. Uneasy with the growth of Iuz’s faith, many southerners joined together to form Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 93 the Horned Society, making Molag their capital. No one knows the true age of the Horned Society. Most scholars believe its Hierarchs were opportunist bandits who ﬁlled the void in Molag left by the disappearance of Iuz in 505 CY, only to be swept away in 583 after the demigod’s return. More ominous speculation places the roots of the organization well before the great migrations of old. Certain old druids speak of the dreaded “Horned Ones,” cultists who stalked the night in ancient times and preyed upon the Flan tribes. It is not certain if the modern Horned Society is actually a descendant of this dark sect or simply an imitator exploiting old legends. In any case, the Horned Society came to prominence in 513 CY, a few years after the disappearance of Iuz in the north, when the cambion’s malign kingdom went leaderless. The group seized the city of Molag and set about consolidating the territory around under its rule. Hochjebli, euroz, and other non-humans ﬂocked to the Horned Society’s dark banner. The Horned Society is made up of thirteen leaders, called Hierarchs, including powerful ﬁghters, clerics, rogues, and wizards. The philosophy of the Horned Society is rulership through fear and might, with overtones of human supremacy and the subjugation of lesser races to achieve their goals A New Keoish Dynasty The monikers of each Keoish monarch between Tavish the Weary and Kimbertos I nearly tells a tale: the Listless, the Dilettante, and the Afﬂicted; their reigns were deﬁned by plague, division and madness. Nyhan IV became King on the death of Tavish the Weary. He was expected to return Keoland to the quiet it had known during the Slumbering, focusing on rebuilding the infrastructure that had been disrupted during the later stages of the civil war. But Nyhan had little time to attend any affairs of state. Within the year of his coronation, the ﬁrst cases of a new illness appeared in the Duchy of Salinmoor in the south of Keoland and its severity explains why Keoland had little to do with The Hateful Wars around the Lortmils. Baron Anladon of the Axewood and Duke Sanduschar IV of Gradsul sent their own household troops but Keoland as a nation sat this war out. Through all this Nyhan devoted himself to dealing with the plague. His efforts mattered little, as the plague continued unabated, doing little but distracting him from the Court. After the death of Nyhan IV, his son Senestal III was elected King. Senestal had grown up in the shadow of the plague and he witnessed his three children and all four of his siblings die Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 94 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. from it which placed the Neheli bloodline near collapse. Senestal gave himself to pleasure. House Neheli might fall, but he would go out in style. While this led to the only signiﬁcant accomplishment of his reign, restoring and expanding the Court at Niole Dra, it more than earned him the appellation of the Dilettante. When Prince Corond of Ulek requested aid in retaking the Pomarj from the humanoid survivors of the Hateful Wars, Senestal replied that he was occupied with “affairs of state”, and could not be bothered. His reign ended as it began, in one long celebration in Niole Dra. Senestal’s passing without and heir meant the throne passed to his cousin Trevlyan. By now the plague had claimed more than half of House Neheli. Worse, Trevlyan himself was afﬂicted, leaving him barely capable of doing the few things left for the King with provincial rulers taking on most tasks. His reign was unremarkable and the years limped by until his death. House Neheli suffered many losses to the plague, more so than their Rhola rivals. Without House Neheli as a balance, House Rhola had none to oppose them and balance their expansionist tendencies. To maintain balance, Mohrgyr, Wyrd of the Silent Ones took the young Cedrian Neheli, the closest cousin of Trevlyan the Afﬂicted to the Silent Tower when he was just a baby to guard him from the plague, and raise him to lead House Neheli through the recovery. The Silent Ones educated Cedrian and prepared him for the tasks ahead of him. The ﬁrst came when Trevlyan manifested the ﬁnal stages of the disease. The  King announced his retirement to the family estate, followed by his quiet death there over the winter. It had fallen to Cedrian to end his cousin’s life as gently as possible to save the family from the public disgrace of his madness. Cedrian gave his cousin a hero’s funeral. The second came when it was time to choose a new King. House Neheli was in no shape to rule the Kingdom and rebuild itself. But they could not allow House Rhola to take the throne either during such a vulnerable period. It was Cedrian who chose an obscure relative of House Rhola, the little known ruler of a backwater Barony. And it was Cedrian who convinced the other lords of the Court of the Land into listening to him as he presented an alternative to the scions of either House Neheli or House Rhola as a candidate for King. Breaking an eight century long accord, Kimbertos Skotti- Lizhal was elected to the Lion Throne in 564 CY. Ivid the Fiend-Seeing Ivid V was born in 532 or 533 CY, the second son of Ivid IV. He was forced into the priesthood of Hextor by his father as a form of discipline. To solidify his position as heir to the throne, Ivid had murdered 122 of his siblings, until only his elder brother remained. The two spent many years waging a war of intrigue and assassination in their prison-palace until the younger brother ﬁnally prevailed. It was around this time that  Ivid developed a slowly progressive wasting disease that would gradually make him physically weaker and weaker. Ivid V would eventually gain the Malachite Throne in 556 CY by hiring one of his father’s concubines to pour acid in the Overking’s ear. Ivid was no military genius, but he was a brilliant intriguer and politician, and he knew how to stage a good public execution or, still better, utilize torture to encourage any possible rivals to re-think their plans to oust him. The Screaming Column in Rauxes is one of the most colourful Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 95 testimonies to Ivid V’s innovation in the realm of cowing opposition by fear. It is an open secret that Ivid V has devils within his Companion Guard, and the Fiend-Knights of Doom struck fear into all. Their name itself was a ﬂamboyant, excessively-stated mockery as were their uniforms. They wore gold visors to mock knights and warrior-priests of good deities such as Heironeous. By 565 CY Ivid was increasingly confronting important priesthoods in the Great Kingdom. Temple taxes were greatly increased, and when priests and worshippers tried to get around them by holding simple services of reverence in private homes, Ivid proclaimed a “worship tax” on such gatherings. Around the Great Kingdom, priests of non-evil deities were harassed, assassinated, and persecuted. An inevitable showdown followed. The Patriarch of Pholtus in Rauxes, Emasstus Carcosa, pronounced heresy on Ivid, denouncing him openly as being insane and allied with ﬁends. He called upon the servants of all non-evil powers to ally and oppose the Overking. Perhaps the old patriarch-sage thought that by stopping short of openly inciting insurrection and overthrowing Ivid he might escape with his life—he did not. Ivid had him arrested for treason and subversion and organized the systematic looting of temples of Pholtus in all lands (though in Ahlissa and Medegia have thus far been deﬁant in this matter). Fall of the Bone March For centuries, the descendants of Caldni Vir, 1st Marquis of Spinecastle had ruled the Bone March for the Aerdy Overkings. This durability was attributed to the general effectiveness and honour of the marquises of Spinecastle. Having survived even the Turmoil Between Crowns and constant Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 96 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. raids from the Thillonrian barbarians, little concern was shown when non- humans from the Rakers began raiding the nation with increasing frequency in the late 550s. In 560 CY, the raids took a dramatic upturn, and in 561 a full invasion began. By most accounts, Clement, the last marquis of the march, was a just and effective ruler, noble and forthright, a throwback to Aerdi lords of old. He had close dealings with the archbaron of Ratik, and talk of formal alliance, even union, was always manifest. However, in what is sure to go down as black betrayal if proven true, it has been whispered that Clement’s defenses were compromised by none other than His Grace Grenell, Herzog of North Province. As motive, one need look no further than his ambition to annex Bone March, expanding his holdings all the way to the Rakers. Centuries of hatred between House Naelax and House Vir undoubtedly played a role as well. In 563 CY, euroz invaded Spinecastle by secret ways that offered its defenders little warning or means of preparation. Within just three years, the nonhuman masses had laid low the nation from the outside in and the inside out, dominating the realm from Johnsport almost to the Flinty Hills. A raid into Ratik was attempted, but an alliance between Lexnol and the Fruztii prevented its success. By the end of 563 CY, the whole of the Bone March had settled into a new normal, one of humanoid dominance. All the human settlements had been conquered except the County of Knurl, which was loosely allied with Breka leader of the Vile Rune Orcs prior to the invasion. Those humans that could escape had already done so streaming into Ratik, Nyrond, and the North Province. Knurl itself saw its population more than double. Temple of Elemental Evil Sometime in the late 550s the village of Nulb, on the edge of the Gnarley Forest, began to fester with all manner of evil folk, culminating with the founding of the soon infamous Temple of Elemental Evil. Before long local caravans, noniz clans and the neighboring village of Hommlet became easy targets for bandits from that region. Following many years of these simple raids and complacency among the rural folk, matters grew steadily worse by 568 CY. First was the construction of a moathouse, an outpost east of Hommlet meant for further raids, then agents of Good also discovered that not only was the Temple mustering a small army but that the cult of Elemental Evil was actually under the direction of a powerful demoness. News of this Evil quickly spread from the Viscounty of Verbobonc to the ears of Prince Thrommel IV, Marshall of the combined armies of Furyondy and Veluna and also a renowned paladin. Compelled into a quest, the Prince left behind his concerns to the north, and promptly called upon his most pious knights, clerics and his own picked guards to help bring down this profane temple. Shortly after crossing the Velverdyva River in the spring of 569 CY, the host of Prince Thrommel joined with waiting contingents summoned from Veluna and Verbobonc. Accompanying these forces was Serten of St. Cuthbert, the lone member of the Citadel of Eight to volunteer aid to Thrommel’s cause. Not long after the allied column began their slow march to the southeast they were met by a welcome council of demi-human bands from the Lortmils, Kron Hills and the Gnarley Forest, who had similarly decided to deal with the growing presence of evil at their borders. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 97 When the allied forces closed to within a day of the Temple they ﬁrst encountered the enemy on the open ﬁelds several leagues east of Verbobonc City and north of Hommlet called Emridy Meadows. The bulk of the Temple’s human forces, comprised of mostly mounted bandits, brigands and mercenaries had moved to stall Thrommel’s advance. Elven scouts then reported that a much larger than expected army of creatures was approaching from the south. Knowing the Temple might empty its entire horde early, Thrommel went with a contingency plan drawn up in council. In an attempt to draw this Horde of Elemental Evil away from any population centers, he ordered the withdrawal of the entire allied column north, to a strategic position near the east bank of the Velverdyva River. Despite some later historical accounts there was no signiﬁcant ﬁghting at Emridy Meadows, for the only action that day was light cavalry skirmishes screening the withdrawal to a more favourable battleﬁeld. Outnumbering their foes by more than three to one and eager for their ﬁrst combat victory in the region, the Horde of Elemental Evil predictably pursued Thrommel’s forces north. It was at dawn when the horde was roused early from their rest by the signal horns of the allies preparing their formations for battle. The packed ranks of the allied contingents were arrayed so that 500 pikemen were protected on their ﬂank by the Velverdyva River while at the center was displayed the colourful banners of 400 light cavalry and 100 heavy cavalry led by Thrommel himself. Finally, on the allied left were deployed blocks of 100 Lortmil dwarves and 300 Kron Hill gnomes, with about 50 olven archers of clan Meldarin positioned in between. The Horde of Elemental Evil was comprised of two forces. On the hordes’ left ﬂank rode 550 human cavalry made up of bandits and Nulbish thugs with little experience in warfare beyond raiding lightly defended caravan trains. To the bandit’s right was a much larger force of humanoid infantry, a host of 3500 orcs drawn from the dark forests to the southeast and even the very depths of the Oerth. Also among them howled frenzied warbands of kell some 500 strong, and towering over all nearly 20 crudely armed eiger culled by the Temple from the surrounding wilds to provide heavy support. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 98 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. With reckless abandon the cultist lieutenants commanded their human cavalry ranks to engage the right ﬂank and center of the allied forces, not that the rabble of humanoids gave them much choice. The majority of the Horde immediately charged the allied left ﬂank once they saw the shields and heard the taunts of their traditional enemies. The enraged mass of humanoids was allowed to push aside the smaller demi-human ranks in a hasty attempt to encircle the rest of the allied army. Thrommel’s pikemen and screening cavalry also allowed the charging bandit cavalry to penetrate their line leaving them between the bend of the Velverdyva River and packed in with the encircling mob of humanoids. This of course sprung the trap planned by the Prince. At once the whole allied army pivoted counter-clockwise to encircle the Horde in this pocket. As Thrommel’s knights quickly turned to counter-attack the humanoid main body from the rear, 150 more olven warriors came from hidden reserve in the Gnarley Forest to close the killing arc. With their backs to the river and their leadership in disarray, the Horde of Elemental Evil was completely routed. While most fought to the death, scattered groups did manage to break out of the allied lines only to be hunted down or drowned in ﬂight. However some survivors were allowed to ﬂee south back to their Temple as a message of what was to come next. After the ﬁeld was won Prince Thrommel wasted little time in rallying his weary troops and collecting their fallen. The most storied among those slain at Emridy was Serten of St. Cuthbert who fell during the ﬁnal moments of the battle zealously defending the Prince to his last breath. This would later be a major loss to the Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 99 allies’ plans for their next phase in the campaign, the siege of the Temple of Elemental Evil. Fall of the Temple News of the victory at Emridy Meadows spread fast to Hommlet, the ﬁrst evidence coming as strange men dressed in ochre were sighted running through the village in panic. The Temple of Elemental Evil lay within a couple days march for the allied host. Their coming emboldened the local villagers and farmers, knowing the end of the Temple was at hand. The allied forces, having met no resistance on their march were refreshed and well supplied once they ﬁnally laid siege to the walled fortress of the Temple. Inside the cult of Elemental Evil futilely held out with a scant garrison of troops, falling within a fortnight as the army threw down the upper works of their fortress just short of damaging the central Temple itself. Only a few of the vile leaders of the Temple managed to escape, and it is said these vengeful individuals were later to blame for the sudden disappearance of Prince Thrommel IV in 573 CY. Fearing a raid on the dungeons of the profane Temple would be too costly given the presence of a major demoness (Zuggtmoy), Prince Thrommel summoned all his mages and clerics to cooperate in creating great seals to bind this evil within the deepest parts of her own dungeon. Four pairs of large bronze doors starting with the Grand Entrance of the Temple were each bound with heavy iron chains and their seams ﬁlled with softened metal. Lastly runes were carved into the bronze portals bearing abjurations of arcane and holy power. With the ﬁnal spells in place Evil was contained at last, but in the following years, agents of Good would remain nearby to keep an eye on the Temple for its inevitable resurgence. Nearly inconsequential during the siege of the Temple, the raiders’ moathouse was the last piece to fall before Thrommel’s quest was complete. While the Prince oversaw the binding of the Temple, he sent a splinter force with their leftover siege machines to take the small outpost. Remarkably a mob of villagers from Hommlet, long terrorized by the evils of this place, joined in to help surround and raze the moathouse. There was no shortage of heroes at the Battle of Emridy Meadows. Viscount Wilfrick attained fame for his part in commanding the campaign. His fortune and gratitude was shown to Hommlet through the construction of a temple of St. Cuthbert and the beginnings of a walled castle bestowed upon Burne the wizard and his friend the warrior Rufus, both veterans of Emridy. Finally brave Serten was given a grandiose funeral service in Verbobonc attended by many who fought with him at Emridy. Ironically, also in attendance were all his former companions from the disbanded Citadel of Eight whom for their own selﬁsh reasons, had failed to take part in the most historic battle of the century. Iuz’s Return In the half-century

since

the disappearance  of their dark master, the cultists of the imprisoned Iuz had eliminated their rivals in Dorakaa and established a tenuous peace with the Horned Society to the south. In 570 CY, Robilar, his orcish henchman Quij, and the priest Riggby ventured to the Godtrap at Mordenkainen’s urging. Using magics Mordenkainen had given them, they freed Iuz with the intent of slaying him. Tenser and Bigby showed up shortly thereafter, Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 100 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. and a ﬁve-against-one melee ensued. Bigby might have crushed the weakened Iuz to death using his famed Hand spells, but Iuz’s magic lashed back at him, leaving him catatonic for days. Iuz returned to Dorakaa, slaying impostors, dissidents, and those whose bodies exploded particularly entertainingly, their skulls adding to Iuz’s grisly road. Iuz established himself as a living god, and the Oerth trembled. Though aware of the return of his nation’s old foe, King Belvor IV of Furyondy seems to be avoiding it, concentrating on uniting the quarrelling factions within his own country instead. Iuz, for his part, has spent some time ensuring he has absolute mastery of his kingdom before making whatever his next move may be. Global Village The year 571 CY will long be remembered across Oerik as the year the world got a little smaller with the opening of two major trade routes: the Mithril Road between the Baklunish West and the mysterious Suhfeng lands and the “discovery” of the Flanaess by Touv explorers from Hepmonaland. In 571CY, the renowned Touv explorer and adventurer, Zakn Boku, took to the skies in the latest experimental invention of the Azandes School of Technomancy: the airship. Difﬁcult to control in even moderate winds, Boku managed to successfully navigate two of his three airships north of Hepmonaland where they made landfall in Lordship of Isles. His other craft, The Lion’s Pride went down in a storm somewhere in the Pelagio Swamp. Initially met with fear and trepidation, the Lords of the Isles soon changed their attitude when presented with lavish Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 101 luxury gifts from Great Zundali and offers of future trade and peace. In recent years, Boku has made an additional 4 voyages north, gaining great wealth in the process. In the west of the Flanaess, two great caravans, following separate paths, made their way across the treacherous and inhospitable Dry Steppes from east to west. Taking a northern route that skirts the horrors of Old Ghayar, members of the Mouqollod House Ashmol, with a train of over 400 camels and horse drawn wagons, entered into the city of Sa’han and brokered trading rights between west and east. Concurrently, pilgrims from the Theocracy of the Pale, followed a path through Ull and along a southern route that eventually saw them through to a lush valley deep in the Tyrurzi Mountains where their prophet, Prestorus the Great ordered his followers to settle. Thus the nation of Prestoria was formed. In the intervening years, messengers have been sent back east to invite true believers of the Blinding Light to make the pilgrimage to the far west. These two new routes have stirred the local Paynim tribes who see both opportunity in banditry and danger in the encroachment on their traditional lands. Recent Events Most recently, in 573 CY, a secretive monastic group called the Scarlet Brotherhood was discovered to exist on the Tilvanot Peninsula when they began sending out ambassadors and offering their sages as advisors and teachers to the courts of nations from Irongate to Zeif. Whether their motives are as altrusitic as they appear has yet to be revealed. Finally, as the calendar turns to the year 576 CY the most recent news from around the Flanaess is grave. The lands of Sterich and Geoff have been coming under increasing more numerous incursions by bands of giants and humanoids. Much of these territories have already been lost to the creatures as Keoland dithers in its response to the pleas for aid coming from its once dependent vassals. In the central regions of the Flanaess new rumours are circulating of a return of evil to the Kron Hills and bandit and monster attacks on caravans have increased greatly of late causing concern for both the Viscount of Verbobonc and many a gnome laird in the Kron Hills. In the Aerdi lands evil is afoot. To stave off the wasting disease that was threatening to ﬁnally kill Ivid V, Zenor Redhand, High Priest of Hextor, with the aid of powerful ﬁends, performed a dark ritual over the decrepit form of Ivid V. Ivid emerged to sit upon the Fiend-Seeing Throne as Ivid the Undying. With the opening of trade routes between the Flanaess both west and south, the exploration of foreign lands is on the rise, trade is surging upward, and opportunities for heroism (and proﬁts) are unlimited. Embassies are being opened in far off lands, factions are jostling for position and power, and Oerik awaits those who would seize its adventures and shape its future. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 102 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Chapter One: The Continent of Oerik 103 Greyhawk establishes its theme and tone, largely based on six important factors. Be- low is a primer to explain these key areas in order to give the reader a broad idea what the setting has to offer you as a dungeon master or player. Maps: The ﬁrst thing you’ll notice about the original Greyhawk books are the maps are works of art. Darlene (she legally dropped her surname in 1984)  created the ﬁrst maps, given a hexagon overlay. They are vibrant in colour and evoke the style of hand drawn explorer maps. These maps are simple, elegant and full of potential for development by DMs. The original maps are two part, poster sized and encompass the eastern half of the continent of Oerik on the planet Oerth. Then what do we mean by the World of Greyhawk? The Free City of Greyhawk is the largest city on the map and is the central hub for all knowledge, intrigue, and adventure in the setting. It’s through the lens of Greyhawk that we view or play out the events unfolding in the world. More recently, Anna Meyer began recreating these Greyhawk maps using modern graphic design software and gave the World of Greyhawk maps a fresh, modern appearance.  Anna also worked tirelessly adding details such as the locations of dungeons, ruins, towns and villages mentioned in the plethora a Greyhawk-related publications since its original release date in 1980.  Her maps were used extensively as references in the creation of this book and are an invaluable resource to the Greyhawk community. (Thank you Anna!) History & War: The World of Greyhawk has a backdrop of ancient history and ongoing war. The perfect comparison for this in today’s pop culture is the Game of Thrones series. East Oerik was once populated by peaceful Flannae nomads, elves, dwarves and their like. Wars in Western Oerik and a pair of twin cataclysms forced Suel and Oerid migrants eastward where, after centuries of colonization, nation building and more wars, resulted in the current political landscape. To further lend to the medieval fantasy feel, Greyhawk is home to many noble Houses and Knighthoods such as the orders of the Hart, Holy Shielding and the Watch. There are several main regions of Greyhawk (such as the Great Kingdom, the Sheldomar Valley or the Baklunish West) and all are constantly on the edge of some conﬂict with one another. Greyhawk Rebooted assumes a campaign start date of 576 C.Y. which is before the Greyhawk Wars so material from that boxed set and everything that was published after, is not automatically assumed in the Greyhawk Rebooted setting. Magic: Greyhawk by virtue of its age and being based on Gary Gygax’s home campaign, is the origin of hundreds of notable D&D spells, magic items, artifacts and more. Whether you play 1st Edition or 5th Edition, you will immediately be immersed in a Greyhawk campaign once you cast a Tenser’s Floating Disk or equip your ranger with a Quiver of Ehlonna. Greyhawk Set and Setting Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 104 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Despite comparisons, Greyhawk is a high magic world (posing as a low magic one). It is quite full of wizards, sorcerers and warlocks like Mordenkainen’s Circle of Eight, the Silent Ones of Keoland or the Guild of Wizardry in the City of Greyhawk, and of course evil spell-casters in the service of Iuz the Old. The World of Greyhawk is full of ancient buried empires, tombs of brooding liches and more, all with magic yet to be discovered by adventurers. Deities: Clerics and paladin players will rejoice at the abundant lists of deities for the World of Greyhawk. These pantheons are divided into a few cultural pools, the Suloise, Oeridian, Flannae, Baklunish, Murian, Zahindish, Touv and other gods. Just like gods of our mythologies, Greyhawk has a deity for just about everything if you’re inclined. These pantheons have mixed over the centuries however, so now the more interesting and commonly known ones are focused on. Do a quick perusal through any D&D book, and you will ﬁnd references to great Greyhawk deities that cover every character alignment option, like Pelor the sun god, Wee Jas the goddess of death and magic, Nerull the reaper, Heironeous the god of justice and his evil brother Hextor god of war. Evil, Good and the Balance: Thematically, the World of Greyhawk is a struggle of balance between good and evil with some NPCs just trying to play both sides. Evil is always ascendant in this setting. Liches (Acererak), cultists, witches (Iggwilv) or plain bandits are a constant here. When one villain falls, there always seems to be another ready to rise. Iuz is undoubtedly the greatest of these villains; a despotic demigod in the ﬂesh, ruling over an empire of orcs, undead and demons. When you hear of Iuz just think of Sauron and the land of Mordor from Lord of the Rings. Up against such odds, adventurers are often thrust into the role of heroes for the cause of Good especially paladins and clerics of good gods like St Cuthbert, but this is by no means the only option. Greyhawk is literally gray in its tone. Characters can easily be amoral and content looting dungeons and raiding towers, enriching and empowering themselves without heed to the bigger picture. Iconic Adventures: And lastly, Greyhawk is best known for its adventure modules. By now, what D&D player hasn’t heard of the Tomb of Horrors, Against the Giants or the Temple of Elemental Evil? Searching dungeons, ruins and caverns is a way of life in this setting. The ruins of Castle Greyhawk, Maure Castle or the Temple of Elemental Evil are mega-dungeons that can occupy a characters entire career. Many other modules require great treks being set in remote jungles, icy mountains, deep swamps or far below in the UnderOerth. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 106 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Playable Races H umans are the most common people, by far, on the World of Oerth, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halﬂings, gnomes and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples. Dwarves, elves, halﬂings, gnomes and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties. Half-elves, half-orcs, and even half-ogres are less common as adventurers. Unlike other game worlds, Drow, a subrace of elves, are unheard of above ground, save in legend and rumour as are Duergar and, to a lesser extent, Svirfneblin. And then there are two default 5e playable races that pose a particular problem: Dragonborn and Tieﬂings. Neither of these races existed during the formative or heyday years of Greyhawk development. At ﬁrst glance, they simply don’t ﬁt with that traditional Greyhawk “set & setting”. The same can be said for nearly all of the additional playable races from sourcebook such as Volo’s Guide to Monsters (VGtM), Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide ( SCAG), and Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes (MToF) let alone racial options presented in setting and adventure books such as The Elemental  Evil Players Companion (EEPC), The Guildmaster’s Guide to Ravnica (GGtR), Mythic Odyssey of Theros (MOoT), Eberron: Rising from the Last War (ERftLW), the Tortle Package (TTP), and the Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount (EGtW). As mentioned in the ﬁrst paragraph of this chapter: Oerth is a human-dominated world. This is especially true of the region known as The Flanaess.  This region is the original home to most of the common demi-human races and also the ancestral homelands to the the majority of the classic Greyhawk human ethnicities like the Oeridians, Suloise, Flannae and Baklunish. In fact its this human-centricity that helps set the World of Greyhawk apart from other well known settings like The Forgotten Realms world of Toril. While a Dragoborn, Firbolg, Tortle, Kenku or Tieﬂing walking down a main thoroughfare in Waterdeep may be no cause for concern, such an event in the City of Greyhawk, Mitrik or Niole Dra most certainly will raise more than a few eyebrows.  In fact, the character may be run out of town or violently attacked on site under the worst circumstances. Similarly, monstrous races like the Chapter Two: Playable Races 107 orcs, goblins and gnolls (euroz, jebli and kells in the Flan tongue) are generally not available as player characters in traditional Greyhawk games. These folk are the ancestral enemies of humanity and demi- humanity alike and hatred between them runs deep. This was the default approach to game design in the early days of D&D. Much black and white with fewer shades of gray.  Today, the game has evolved and there is more room for moral relativism. To that end, and since this publication is intended to update the setting to 5e, all playable races available from the above listed sources are also presented here, sometimes in a modiﬁed format to help them ﬁt better into the set and setting of Oerik. It is still highly recommended that games played in the traditional region of the Flanaess try to maintain that human (demi- human)-centricity. Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY covers more than just the Flanaess however so those interested in playing more exotic races will ﬁnd plenty of opportunity in the far off realms of Hepmonaland, Zahind, Mur or the Celestial Empire. There are many other species on Oerik that are sentient and have cultures of their own although folk in most civilized lands might view these others as strange or barbaric at best, or monsters to fear and run from at worst. Note: Only races not considered “outright evil” by the majority of “civilized” humans and demi-humans are presented. Races like Orcs, Goblins, Gnolls, Yuan- Ti and Drow are generally not playable in standard Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY campaigns. That said, please see the DM’s Guide to Oerik book for information on playing a humanoid or underoerth-centric campaign in Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 108 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Monsters? The ﬁghting of monsters is the bread and butter of adventurers, whether they be intelligent beasts like goblins and ogres, or stupid and ravening creatures like gorgons and grell. Hoarders of treasure, kidnappers of maidens and nobles, weavers of dark plots and keepers of goodly wisdom, monsters ﬁll all sorts of roles in the wilderness life of Oerik. Many monsters are stupid, ravening predators that are nothing but enemies to humans and demi-humans. Most of these will cross paths with adventurers when they are the minions of some intelligent evil, are preying on innocents, or simply meet adventuring bands on their travels. Relishing battle and violence, chances are they must be immediately destroyed, as they will give and expect no quarter from their enemies. Of course, unintelligent predators have much more important roles than to simply destroy and kill. They are important parts of an ecological chain, often feeding on excessive numbers of game animals or amounts of vegetation. They thus fulﬁll the position that wolves, bears and other natural carnivores do, only on a larger scale. They also attack and feed on each other freely, and these habits keep the monster populations more manageable. Not all monsters are evil or vicious— some, such as the rust monster, the almir’aj or the infamous ﬂumph, are as innocuous as deer, rabbits or moles. Many of these could conceivably be kept as pets, but their abilities or wild nature often prevents this. Most of them do not attack sentient creatures, since they know instinctively that they would be killed. Many are herbivores or feed on minerals, fungi, or metal. Those that eat metal and minerals might attack humans to get their food, but are quite happy to leave their would-be opponents alone if these give them what they want, Those who are carnivorous usually eat small game such as rabbits, voles, or other creatures like them. Intelligent monsters are another matter entirely. Intelligent humanoid creatures such as orcs, goblins, and giants all have their own communities and their own social structures. Some of them have organized systems of government and politics, with hereditary kings and chiefs, and live in their own cities and villages. These may be constructed by the monsters as any human would do, and sometimes they are taken by the monsters from human victims. Humanoids and giants are the most persistent and most evil of raiders and those nonhuman creatures who plague mankind, but others are far worse. Demons, devils, and daemons (i.e. yugoloths) all have their own powers and plots for causing mayhem and suffering on the material plane, and they are masters of using both bloodied swords and honeyed words to get what they want. The derro, the illithids, the aboleth, and other creatures such as the fabled drow rarely interact with surface dwellers on a regular basis, but still pose threats to those who travel through their domains. Other creatures are of course of goodly nature and may help heroes and those working for noble means who pass through their domain. The members of any demi- human race, certain members of the fairy-folk such as sprites or nymphs, and otherworldly creatures of good such as ki-rin, lammasu, and devas may all offer assistance. However, this aid is usually token at best, as most of these creatures fear retaliation if their complicity in defeating any great evil is made known. Chapter Two: Playable Races 109 Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 110 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. The creatures of good from the upper planes must aid heroes indirectly or in a secondary role outside of the area covered by the Celestial Empire; to act directly both goes against their purpose and invites retaliation from enemies. Only when they are threatened directly will these races aid in a direct fashion. This aid will usually take the form of assistance in any military battles that are to come, or to ﬁght beside the heroes against whatever enemy threatens them all. Needless to say, not every monster will be an ally or enemy of those they meet, or be caught up in some epic struggle of good and evil. There have been times when monsters have lived in mutually beneﬁcial relationships with humans and demi-humans. One of the most famous examples is the otyugh—humans will feed the otyugh all their waste and garbage. The monster gets a life of luxury and an unlimited food supply, while the humans are saved having to burn or sort through their waste, and can live in clean streets and homes. Monsters such as griffons can make very effective mounts, while giant eagles can make ﬁne spies. Creatures such as centaurs and fairies may work in tandem with humans, living together off the land in partnership. These monsters, in addition to rarer creatures like goodly giants and fantastical creatures such as guardian naga, may dwell in the courts of certain lands such as Tenh, Geoff and some circles of Perrenland. Orcs, goblins and giants may hold particular places in the social structures of evil realms, most infamously in the Great Kingdom and its component states. Demi-humans commonly live in the social structures of almost every human realm, and are commonly merchants, entertainers, and warriors in their own right. Local human settlements might have alliances with them, and be entertained by their actors. What is surprising is that evil creatures may live in this way as well. A few very daring humanoids have set themselves up as mercenaries, entertainers and even merchants, although these are rare and usually serve their own kind or the people of realms who readily accept their presence, such as the Horned Society or Great Kingdom. Evil humans often have no qualms about entering into treaties with lawful monsters such as orcs and goblins, just as their goodly counterparts might do with dwarfs or elves. Humanoids can also be found in free cities such as Greyhawk, Dyvers and perhaps even Dullstrand, although they rarely ﬁnd any true acceptance in the free cities as opposed to those overtly evil countries. Usually they are panhandlers and rufﬁans who are forced to live with other rogues and thieves in the gutter. They may ﬁnd work as assassins or the members of press-gangs, and some of them join street gangs to ﬁnd the money, power and respect they otherwise lack. The merchants and entertainers of the humanoid races are also conﬁned here, forced to work in shoddy stalls and perform in rat hole inns. Mercenaries are luckier- those few that survive long enough to join a mercenaries’ guild will generally have a better time of it, although by nature they are hired and employed by evil families and unethical merchants. With all of this diversity in sentient races, it becomes obvious that there are playable options beyond the normal human, elf, dwarf, etc. paradigm. 5e has a plethora of races and, with a little work and imagination, we’ve tried to integrate in as many as possible.  The original Greyhawk didn’t provide the freedom to do this so many of these other races have been worked into the development of the lands beyond the Flanaess. We doubled down on the “Here there be Dragonborn!” concept. Chapter Two: Playable Races 111 Friendly or hostile reception? Although charisma is often overlooked when ﬁghting dragons or engaging in magical research, it can be critical in determining whether one spends the night in a warm and comfortable inn or a leaky, rat-infested stable. This is especially important in rural areas, where the goodwill of the townsfolk usually determines whether you may even be allowed into the village in the ﬁrst place! Depending on your character, peasant villagers will treat you in different ways; grim and taciturn peoples will take your money and give you service, but no more. Friendly and jolly peoples can fete you with songs and ale, provided you repay them with tales and news, as rural folk often get little news besides what travellers bring to them. Coolly hostile peoples will either make you sleep on the outskirts of town, ignore you altogether, or simply chase you off. Charisma determines how good or bad a reception one may get, but many other factors come into play. Racial relations can be a factor—dwur mines and olven tree-villages often show low-key hostility to each other when travellers of the other race attempt to pass through their lands. National alliances and prejudices can also change one’s mind—the people of Geoff will greet olves and citizens of Sterich with open arms, although be merely friendly to those from Keoland or the Uleks. People from the Aerdy states will either be ignored or harassed by many in Nyrond and the Iron League states. How one behaves is another important thing to consider. Being excessively nosy, boastful, rude, arrogant, or greedy turns off many potential friends, and people who act this way often get higher prices and worse service as a result. Being friendly, courteous and generous with your money has the opposite effect. Minding one’s own business and not angering village elders or other important ﬁgures are also important. All of the above notwithstanding, the sad, simple fact is that some people do not like or trust the presence of adventurers, and are so prejudiced against them that they will order all such people to leave voluntarily or run out of town. In large cities, most people tend to ignore visitors, unless they are of a race or nationality the inhabitants dislike, in which case they may suffer the same mistreatment as described above. Otherwise, if a person breaks no laws and does not offend anyone powerful, they will generally be served and treated like any other travellers. Monstrous Races The impact your character’s race has on ﬁrst impressions depends on the speciﬁc location of your campaign. Races considered “exotic” or “monsters” on the Flanaess may be common place in other regions (a Lizardfolk PC in an Amedio Jungle campaign for example). In more traditional campaigns, those set in the civilized lands of the Flanaess for example, playing a character of an exotic race would require careful cooperation with the DM to ﬁt the character’s back story into the campaign. Players of such characters should also be aware that your choice of race could have a signiﬁcant impact on in-game play. A player playing an Lizardfolk character in a game set in and around Verbobonc, or Highfolk, or Sunndi will likely face challenges that those playing humans, elves or gnomes would not. This is also true in the inverse. Characters playing elves and dwarves may Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 112 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. need to take special care when travelling through humanoid dominated lands to overcome the racial prejudice felt toward them. This is a signiﬁcant difference between 1e and 5e and between Greyhawk and other settings like The Forgotten Realms. Things tend to be more black and white in 1e Greyhawk than they are in 5e Forgotten Realms for example. Moral relativism has taken a more prominent place in the 5e game, and that is not a bad thing. Many shades of grey can be as fun as good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. But again, the traditional set and setting of Greyhawk has leaned heavily on that binary approach heroes vs.villains. Similarly, sensitivity to racial stereotypes and cultural appropriation is the way forward as the game evolves and adapts to an ever-changing society. As designers, we fully support this approach to game design especially as it relates to each player feeling welcome,  safe and represented at any gaming table. In the traditional world of Greyhawk, Orc = Bad. Racial prejudice can be a signiﬁcant obstacle. Similarly, things like slavery, while abhorrent in our real world, is not uncommon on Oerik although only amongst typically evil cultures and cults.  And therein lies the most important point, Orc = Bad because Orc = Evil and it is assumed that most, if not all PCs are ﬁghting the forces of evil, not because Orc = Different. Aasimar It is normally extremely rare for a celestial to take romantic interest in a mortal human outside the Celestial Empire where it is uncommon, but not unknown. The products of these pairings are known as Aasimar. Aasimar run the full spectrum of human appearance, though they tend to be beautiful and lithe, with a ﬂicker of divine warmth in their smiles. Aasimars are usually tall, good- looking, and generally pleasant. Some have a minor physical trait suggesting their heritage, such as silver hair, golden eyes, or an unnaturally intense stare. While the non-human or demi-human races listed in this section can be viable player characters, such PCs may face challenges  that those of the more traditional races do not. Whenever these characters openly enter into a civilized settlement they will be at disadvantage on all Charisma and Charisma-based skill checks. Any failed roll should be fully role-played by the DM potentially even to the level of torches and pitchforks at dawn depending on the character’s actions. Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. The following races are open to play in a GREYHAWK5e campaign. The following are the standard, traditional races from The World of Greyhawk. (with a few twists) Chapter Two: Playable Races 113 Aasimar are found almost exclusively in the Celestial Empire where they form the upper echelons of the major ministries of the Celestial Bureaucracy. Most are descendent of Suhfeng ancestors who fell in  love with celestial warriors who aided in the winning of the Demon Wars. Some descend from Mist Dragons, others from Devas or other even more obscure celestial beings. Most Aasimar are decidedly good-aligned. They ﬁght against evil causes and attempt to sway others to do the right thing. Occasionally they take on the vengeful, judgemental aspect of their celestial ancestor, but this is rare. Aasimar excel as clerics and paladins, and tend to favour these classes. Aasimar and all sub-classes can be played as described in Volo’s Guide to Monsters (VGtM). Aarakocra The Aarakocra of Oerik differ from those outlined in VGtM.  Like those, Aarakocra of Oerik resemble humanoid birds. They differ in their physiology however. An aarakocra is vaguely humanoid in appearance, resembling a human-sized, bipedal eagle whose wings fold into over- long arms. Aarakocra plumage varies from tribe to tribe and region to region, and also varies with respect to gender; the males are always crested and gaudier than the females. Within the race, aarakocra plumage serves no purpose other than a means for identiﬁcation. Aarakocra have 5” grey-black beaks which resemble a cross between that of a parrot and an eagle. Their faces are birdlike, except that the eyes are placed frontally to provide binocular vision. Facial shape varies little; the bird-men identify their peers by their plumage, not by their faces. The only known exception to this is the sub-race of Stryx whose different visage may be the result of outsider inﬂuence. Halfway along the edge of each wing is a hand with three human-sized ﬁngers and an opposable thumb. An elongated fourth ﬁnger extends the length of the wing and locks in place during ﬂight. The hands cannot grasp while ﬂying, but are nearly as useful as human hands when an aarakocra is perched and its wings folded back. Most aarakocra prefer clothing that allows their wings to be unfurled at will but some do wear long cloaks or robes over their wings at times. The bird-men are a timid and reclusive race, living far from humanity and civilization. Yet, like humans, the aarakocra have some exceptional individuals who ﬁnd this peaceful and pastoral life a little dull. It is these individuals who become adventurers. Such individuals are generally believed to be insane by the rest of the race. It is a curious fact that some adventuring aarakocra do suffer from a mild form of mental malady. Most bird-men adventurers share the usual racial distaste for enclosed places and underground environments, but some claim to have no fear of such places at all. These latter aarakocra are the insane ones. Aarakocra who venture into any enclosed environment become unusually quiet and peer about with wide eyes, though they otherwise seem calm. The vast majority of Aarakocra live high in the peaks of the Yatils and Barrier Peak ranges. Some aeries are also known to exist in the Sulhaut mountains but there are few to none known in the Crystalmists and Hellfurnaces. Aarakocra are unknown further east on the Flanaess. Beyond this region one well know population of the Stryx sub-race exists in the Tyurzi Mountains to the east of Behow. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 114 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. With regard to personality, the bird- men vary almost as much as humans do,though all manage to retain one element of character common to their race: a strong love of freedom. This love results from the airborne lifestyle of the aarakocra. As a result, they ﬁnd urban life con- straining and uncomfortable, and all are afﬂicted with very strong claustrophobia.  As noted above, however, some adventuring aarakocra are able to restrain or overcome this fear, and are thus able to enter a town or city at least for short periods of time. Still, even these bold adventurers refrain from extended stays in closed-in, urban settings and enter dungeons only under the gravest circumstances. Of course, this doesn’t mean that a fellowship must be broken every time the PCs stay at an inn or have a town adventure; aarokocra are happy to sleep on the roofs of inns or other buildings (Skraaaak! A few feathers and the place’ll be cozy enough!). They may also serve as aerial surveillance troops, since it is being in cities, not above them, that the aarakocra dislike. A problem with the footloose and f r e e d o m - l o v i n g lifestyle of the aarakocra is their lack of respect for the ground-based “walkers,” as they call most humans and demi-humans. The bird-men cannot believe that grounded individuals have any freedom at all, or that such individuals can be anything other than boring, depressed dimwits (the psychology of dwarves is totally alien to them). Of course, this opinion often changes with time and familiarity, but still leaves room for some good jokes. As a monotheistic culture, the Aarakocra worship the minor god Krocaa as their only deity. To the Aarakocra, their deity is the divine representation of the sun. Aarakocra worship the sun because it provides them with the thermals they need to soar in search of food. The shaman also leads the mystic rituals used to summon an air elemental. Summoning an air elemental is usually done only in preparation for the tribe’s most sacred ceremony, the hunt. Small tribes must band together for this ceremony to allow the triumvirate to be formed. The ceremony to summon an air elemental must be conducted at dawn and requires the oldest male and female to emit a high- Chapter Two: Playable Races 115 pitched keening whistle. The shaman conducts an intricate dance around them, simultaneously chanting an ancient summoning mantra. Aarakocra are staunch enemies of cults of Elemental Evil and the ﬁend lord Pazuzu and let very little distract them when they are close to unravelling their enemies’ plans. Aarakocra ﬂocks are generally led by an elder, typically a druid or cleric but occasionally a great warrior. They have little experience with arcane magics. An interesting feature of the aarakocra is their extra pair of “hands”, i.e., their feet. These netherhands are used for ﬁghting when an Aarakocra is in ﬂight, but serve as feet when on the ground. Consequently, having four hands does not affect their number of attacks per round. What it does allow is for the Aarakocra character to wield weapons like javelin, swords or even a bow with their netherhands while maintaining ﬂight. Aarakocra Traits As an aarakocra, you have certain traits in common with your people. Being able to ﬂy at high speed starting at 1st level is exceptionally effective in certain circumstances and exceedingly dangerous in others. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Alignment. Most aarakocra are chaotic in alignment with the majoirty leaning toward good. Size. Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall. They have thin, lightweight bodies that weigh between 80 and 100 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Although they are excellent ﬂiers, aarakocra are clumsy on the ground. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Flight. You have a ﬂying speed of 50 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor. You can wield weapons or use object using your feet without penalty while in ﬂight. Eagle Eyed. You have advantage on Perception rolls related to vision. Hollow Bones. A major disadvantage for the bird-men lies in their hollow, fragile bones, which make the aarakocra very weak in grappling combat. Any damage sustained by an aarakocra during grappling is considered a critical hit. Languages. You can speak and read, Aarakocra, Common and you’re able to communicate with all forms of birds. You cannot write. Sub-races

There is only one know aarakocra sub- race on Oerik and that is the vulturine folk of western Oerik. The Stryx sub-race inhabit most of the mountain ranges of western Oerik but are unknown on the Flanaess. Stryx From a distance, a Stryx resembles a huge vulture. Its black eyes, set in the front of the head, provide excellent vision over a long range. The plumage is generally black with a white collar for adult males and black or brown with a smaller grey collar for females. Adolescents are a mixture of brown and black. The beak is large and covers most of the head. Plumage begins at the crown of the head and is darker near the head, except for the collar. Due to their vulturine appearance with featherless heads and dull plumage, Stryx tell each other apart by their faces as do most humans and demi- humans and not by their plumage as do eastern aarakocra. Unlike their eastern cousins, Stryx aren’t unhappy in enclosed spaces, and they they take refuge in caves (or buildings if available). Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 116 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Stryx live in tribes with between 12 and 36 members, depending on the prestige of the leader. The largest tribe ever recorded had nearly 100 members. The tribal hunting territory depends on the size of the tribe, usually about 500 square miles for a tribe of 10 me]bers. Stryx tribes do not recognize boundaries with other tribes and treat other tribes as inferior beings to be eliminated. The largest known ﬂock in 576CY nests in the peaks above the capital city of Behow. Stryx aren’t friendly toward intruders in their territory, especially caravans through the Taklan Pass. They try to extract a toll from caravans for passage through alpine passes and deserts. Neutral-aligned ﬂocks allow unhindered passage of caravans that pay a tribute. If someone refuses to pay the tribute, the Stryx try to capture scouts or outriders from the party and hold them until an even larger tribute is paid. The payment may be either livestock or shiny objects. Stryx are smart enough not to be taken in by glass baubles instead of gems, though most cannot tell the difference between the more common gems and the rare ones. Evil ﬂocks ask for tribute and often attack a caravan whether it pays or not. Stryx frequently raid the Behow valley from one end to the other and some have even been seen gliding high on thermals above the Great Flame Desert of Risay and Komal. Stryx do not venerate Krocaa as do the aarakocra of the Flanaess.  Instead most worship a being known and the Kichan, Lord of Carrion. Warlocks of Kichan lead ﬂocks to trail armies and bandits with the intent on looting, and devouring, any corpses they ﬁnd.  They are a people widely despised by the civilized people of the west who often hunt Stryx for sport. Chapter Two: Playable Races 117 The normal Aarakocra traits are  modiﬁed as follows for Stryx characters: Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Alignment. Most Stryx are chaotic in alignment with the majority leaning toward evil or neutrality. Speed. Although they are excellent ﬂiers, stryx are clumsy on the ground. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Flight. Compared to your eastern kin, you are a clumsy ﬂyer. You have a ﬂying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor. Unlike your eastern kin, your netherhands are not dexterous enough to wield weapons while in ﬂight but you are free to use your natural talons to attack  while ﬂying. Eagle Eyed. You have advantage on Perception rolls related to vision. Hollow Bones. A major disadvantage for the bird-men lies in their hollow, fragile bones, which make the aarakocra very weak in grappling combat. Any damage sustained by an aarakocra during grappling is considered a critical hit. Talons. Your talons are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modiﬁer, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Beak. Your sharp beak can be used offensively in melee. Your bite attack does 1d6 +  your Strength modiﬁer. piercing damage. In addition, the target must  make a successful CON saving throw vs. a DC of 8 + your proﬁciency bonus or be poisoned.

Centaurs Legendary hunters and skilled warriors, centaurs are part man and part horse. They are found primarily on the Dry Steppes and in the lands of the Rovers, Tiger and Wolf nomads, in the lands of Mur and Pesh in the far west and a zebra-like variety is rumoured to exist in southern Hepmonaland. These stoic people vary widely in appearance, their skin tones typically appearing deeply tanned but similar to the humans who occupy nearby regions, while their lower bodies borrow the colorations of local equines. Centaur hair and eyes trend toward darker colours and their features tend to be broad and below the waist, they have the bodies of small horses. Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies—like those of horses— can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs favour long, ﬂowing hair while many tribes in the Wastes of Pesh cut their hair in rough, spiky styles. The upper bodies of centaurs are comparable to human torsos in size, and their lower equine bodies average about 4 feet tall at the withers. Though they are smaller than a human rider mounted on a horse, they ﬁll similar roles as cavalry warriors, messengers, outriders, and scouts. Centaurs typically live to be about 60 years old. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 118 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Centaurs are typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their ﬁnely honed hunting skills to inﬂict deadly wounds. Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups. Chapter Two: Playable Races 119 Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs’ honour, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonour led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth. The Centaur religion is focused on spirit worship and their nature god, Skerrit, while their magic is generally of the natural sort, not the book and lab sort practiced by wizards. The centaurs make little distinction between priests and mages: both serve the same role and have the same stigma. Druids represent the bulk of centaur spell casters. Centaurs suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110).

Centaur Traits The following traits are shared by player characters who are centaurs. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Centaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans. Alignment. Centaurs are inclined toward neutrality. Size. Your size is Medium, 4 feet at the withers, around 61/2 - 7 feet overall. Speed. Your base walking speed is 40 feet. Charge In. Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack as a bonus action. Hooves. Your hooves are natural melee weapons, with which you’re proﬁcient. If you hit with a hoof, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modiﬁer. In addition, you have disadvantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks while walking on hard surfaces such as rock-ﬂoored caverns or cobblestone streets. Equine Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag. In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difﬁcult for you because of your hooves. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 5 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot. Finally, a Medium or smaller creature, that does not have the Power Build trait, can ride on your equine back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue to act independently, not as a controlled mount. Survivor. You have proﬁciency in the Survival skill. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) rolls made in a plains, steppe, or savannah environment. Hybrid Nature. You have two creature types: humanoid and monstrosity. You can be affected by a game effect if it works on either of your creature types. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan Sub-races Rather than playing a normal Centaur, players may optionally choose to play as the Hybsil sub- race below. Chapter Two: Playable Races 121 Hybsil Hybsils appear as a cross between a small antelope and a small human or halﬂing, like a centaur but with the bodies of small deer instead of horses. The colour of a hybsil’s body varies from dark grays and browns to beige and copper. Like normal antelopes, hybsils also often had spots or stripes. They have pointed, elegant ears with a small tuft of hair at the tips. Both males and females have forked antlers, with the males rack being bigger and more impressive. The normal Centaur traits are  modiﬁed as follows: Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Size. Your size is Medium, 3 feet at the withers, around 5 to 51/2 feet overall. Hybrid Nature (fey). Your hybrid nature is humanoid and fey. You have advantage on saving throws vs charm and sleep magic. High Alert. You have proﬁciency in Perception.  You have advantage to detect traps and snares in a  natural, outdoor environment. Antlers. Rather than your hooves, your antlers are your natural melee weapon, with which you’re proﬁcient. If you hit with your antlers, the target takes piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modiﬁer. You do not suffer disadvantage on any Stealth checks due to your hooves. Cervine Build. Any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difﬁcult for you because of your hooves. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 5 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot. Survivor. Your Survival bonus applies to forest instead of plains. Demi-Eiger (Half-Ogre) The half-ogre, or demi-eiger as the Flan refer to these brutes, is a rare creature, generally born from a forced union. In very rare instances, half-ogres are bred to serve in a particularly vicious army. In either case, a half-ogre’s upbringing is rarely a happy one, as they are tolerated for their usefulness and shown little love. Human mothers rarely survives the birth of a demi-eiger offspring. An adult half- ogre stands on average 71/2 to 8 feet tall and weighs 300+ pounds. Skin colour and hair colour is variable but tends to be brown, grayish, black, dull yellow (skin only) or one of the above with a slight grey-green hue. Most demi-eiger have human-like eyes, though about 20% have the white pupils common to eigerkind. There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to being a demi-eiger. On the positive side, their large size allows half-ogres to use two-handed or versatile Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 122 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. weapons one-handed without penalty. Luckily, protective rings, bracers, and amulets may be used by the race, despite their size. On the negative side, demi-eiger characters are usually viewed with fear and suspicion by most civilized folk they come upon. Furthermore, the cost and weight of specially-sized armor and clothing required by normal-sized creatures is twice normal. They are also too big to ride anything but a warhorse, elephant, or other extra-large mount, none of which are of low cost or easily accessible. Those demi-eiger that do manage to survive to adulthood with their sanity intact are solitary creatures, putting their muscles to use while understanding that most civilized folk will give them a wide berth. The demi-eiger much prefers the country to the city, where urban architecture rarely accommodates their bulk. Half-ogres usually have miserable tempers and are quick to anger, but those that show them kindness will never have a more loyal friend. Demi-eiger are usually solitary creatures since, unless they were bred, there are no known half-ogre communities. Most demi-eiger are born into roving ogre bands and are too frail in such instances to live very long. Other demi-eiger are raised in human communities but rarely treated as an equal. Perhaps due to their shame, demi-eiger prefer the company of humans or eiger rather than with other demi- eiger. Demi-eiger  get along well with demi- euroz, especially since they share similar life experiences. Demi-eiger also get along with humans who ﬁnd their strength useful for labour and military purposes. The smaller races tend to be intimidated by half-ogres and the feeling is mutual; demi-eiger fear that noniz or hobniz can play tricks on them or steal their stuff without getting caught. Demi-eiger don’t enjoy the company of olves or demi-olves, as they often have the beauty, grace, and acceptance that was denied to the demi- eiger. Chapter Two: Playable Races 123 A demi-eiger tends to follow the same religion as does the human or eiger community in which she grew up, usually choosing a deity that favours strength or war. Half-ogres tend to be neutral creatures, remaining aloof from society while relying on others for needed supplies, offering their strength in return. For the obvious reasons, demi-eiger gravitate toward the martial classes, such as barbarian and ﬁghter. Demi- eiger usually lack the temperament to be monks, paladins, or rangers. While generally not spell-casters, half-ogre sorcerers, and warlocks are not unknown. Half-ogres are far rarer than other “half breeds” like half elves and half orcs. They are not frequently found in civilized realms in groups but are known to live in cities like Rauxes, Greyhawk, Dyvers and others as individual mercenaries, pugilists or adventurers. It should be noted that unlike the rest of the Flanaess, half-ogres are only uncommon rather than rare in the nation of Ull where they are accepted by society and not simply tolerated.  The current ruler of Ull is half-ogre himself. Half-Ogre Traits

Your Demi-eiger character has an assortment of inborn abilities, some received from your human side with others obviously ogrish in their origin. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength and Constitution scores increases by 2 each to a maximum of 20.  Your Charisma and Dexterity scores are reduced by -1. Age.  Demi-eiger mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years. Alignment. Demi-eiger inherit a tendency toward chaos from their ogre parents. Demi-eiger raised among eiger and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil. Size. Demi-eiger are between 7ft and 8ft in height and weigh between 315 and 425 pounds. Powerful Build. You are considered one size larger with regards to carrying capacity as well as pulling and pushing objects. Unfortunately no ordinary mount can bear your bulk and prodigious weight. Big Hands. You can wield two-handed weapons in only one hand. You ignore the two-handed weapon property. In addition, when wielding weapons with the versatile property in one hand, you may roll the two- handed damage die instead. If you have the dual wielder feat, you gain this beneﬁt with both hands. Darkvision. Demi-eiger can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Imposing Figure. You gain proﬁciency in the Intimidation skill. Strength is your associated ability score instead of Charisma. Iron Stomach. A demi-eiger can consume just about anything without ill effects: Rotting food, carrion, infested food, stagnant water, etc. They are immune to all poison and disease effects from ingesting such fare. Bend Bars/Lift Gates. Due to their great size, prestigious weight, and strength, half-ogres are “the best darn door-openers in the whole universe. Those wimpy little kobolds clutch their ridiculous little spears and whine in unison when 7’6” of solid muscle smashes their door to splinters and walks in, and even other larger monsters have serious reservations about attacking unless they belong to the kamikaze school 1.

You can speak  Common and Giant (but not read or write). Half-Ogres suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Demi-Euroz (Half-Orc) Usually born under questionable circumstances at best, Demi-Euroz, Flan for half-orc,  will usually retain some properties of both species, human and orc, wherever they are raised. Those brought up in orcish society (the male ones, at least) will be immersed in the brutal and militaristic orcish social philosophy. Though orcs have some degree of dislike for “half-humans” among them, they are also aware that such creatures generally possess more adapt- ability and cunning than a full orc, if they don’t  have the potential to be as strong as the average orc. Unless rivalry between the half-orc and his peers ends his life at an early age, the half-orc will usually achieve a quite respectable position of power and inﬂuence in his tribe. Aware that he is not a full orc, the half-orc will probably feel much superior to orcs and assume added arrogance and pride—thus successfully mixing the worst of human qualities with the “best” of the orcish. These sorts of leaders are exceptionally dangerous, possessing enough foresight and intelligence to lead their tribes on much more widespread raiding, banditry, and war- making than is usual for orc bands. Chapter Two: Playable Races 125 Life is not all rosy for this type of leader, of course; rivalries, jealousies, and intrigues will probably continue within the tribe against him unless he becomes powerful enough to command immediate obedience at the risk of swift destruction. Orcish society is generally a male oriented one however, a few cases are known of half-orc women rising to positions of power within a tribe, or a cleric for one of the few orcish religions that permit female priests. In no known cases have female half-orcs become as widely feared or powerful (personally or politically) as male half-orcs, though this is not through any fault of their own. Orcish sexual prejudice is deep and strong. Half-orcs raised in human society, usually without the orcish parent present, have a greater likelihood of adopting a variety of non-orcish attitudes and lifestyles, but even then will have some less savoury aspects to their nature as well. The average human has a dislike for orcs and anything with orcish ancestry; half- orcs will ﬁnd themselves the objects of prejudice in most human communities. Many half-orcs react to the local expectations of them in predictable ways (incidentally reinforcing those stereotypes). In other words, treat a half- orc as if it were dangerous and bad, and they will probably become dangerous and bad if they weren’t already. Half-orcs raised in a human community are very unlikely to be able to speak orcish unless they have had formal study in it. The major exception to the inherent prejudice  most demi-euroz face is the Baklunish nation of Zeif where half-orcs form a respected part of their society in the form of the Eurozary Corp. This elite military unit serves as the personal guard of the Padishah himself. Descendants of the humanoid mercenaries used in the Suel Baklunish Wars, these ﬁerce warriors form an honoured place in Zeifan society. Raised from birth to know nothing but battle and discipline. The Corp is made up exclusively of demi-euroz and demi- eiger, the oldest and more skilled in battle are rewarded for their long service to be mated to specially selected Zeifan women to produce the next generation of Eurozary. Overking Ivid V of Aerdy has recently established a similar personal guard recruited from the humanoid tribes of the Bone March. Other than these, the vast majority of the half-orcs on the Flanaess live lives on the fringes of society, often in not exactly legal professions, many falling to murder and brigandage. Dark of mood and nature, many half-orcs achieve renown despite their rejection by their parents’ folk and many others. Half- orcs are played as described in the PHB. They are found throughout the Flanaess but are especially common in the Pomarj, the Wild Coast, the Horned Society, the lands of Iuz, the Bandit Kingdoms and increasingly, the Great Kingdom.  In civilized lands they are tolerated at best and run out of town on sight at worst. The City of Greyhawk has a sizable half- orc population where they are viewed more with disgust or pity and not outright hatred. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 126 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Demi-Olven (Half-Elves) Half-elves are the offspring of humans and elves. They are highly versatile but not always welcome in elven or human society. They are disproportionately represented among adventurers as a result. The vast majority of Half Elves  on the Flanaess are born of High, or less frequently Sylvan, Elves with Human parents. They are seldom, if ever, born from the union of humans and gray, valley, or wild elves due to the isolationist outlook of those elven sub-races. Half Drow are not uncommon, usually resulting from the unfortunate side effects of a Drow raid upon a surface village or town. Half-elves form a signiﬁcant minority in the Celestial Empire with the vast majority being descended from pairings of olven mandarins and Suhfeng nobility. Half-Elves can be played as presented in the PHB.  Though found most commonly in human areas, half elves face social stigmas among both their kind, which results in many of them becoming traveling adventurers. Dragonborn Dragonborn exist exclusively in western Oerik (and Hepmonaland (see DM’s Guide to Oerik).  They are unknown on the Flanaess and one walking through the streets of Greyhawk, Rel Mord, Mitrik or Niole Dra would likely send citizens running for safety and city guards drawing their blades to defend their wards. In their homeland they serve the Celestial bureaucracy as soldiers, body guards and law enforcement. In the Zahind lands they are almost exclusively elite warriors in the forces of one Raj or another. They have even been employed as mercenaries by the Shah of Risay in her near-constant state of war with the tribes of the Great Flame Desert. Dragonborn came into existence on Oerth some 2000 years ago in the ﬁnal Chapter Two: Playable Races 127 days of the Demon Wars of western Oerik. After a nearly ﬁfty year stalemate in the ﬁght against the demonic and bakemono hoards and ﬁnding their lines at risk of collapse on multiple fronts, the Celestial leadership was becoming desperate for a resolution. That resolution was proposed from an unexpected source.  Convincing the celestial leadership that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” Tiamat agreed to sacriﬁce the life essence of all chromatic dragons in western Oerik to create warriors that would push back the hated forces of chaos in western Oerik. Of course, Tiamat had a condition; Bahamut had to agree to the same bargain. Both dragon gods pledged the life essences of both chromatic and metallic dragons in western Oerik. Thus Dragonborn came into being on Oerth with dozens, if not hundreds, of dragonborn coming into being as each true dragon blinked out of existence.

This inﬂux of draconic troops decidedly turned the tide of the Demon Wars and allowed the Celestials to push the demon lord Ablis and his forces north into the wastelands of Pesh. With the completion of the Dragon Wall after the wars, Tiamat displayed her true plan; she teleported, en masse, all surviving chromatic dragonborn away from the Celestial Empire, never to be seen in the west again.  Few sages know what became of these chromatic dragonborn. Today the remaining Metallic Dragonborn are found almost exclusively in the areas around the Celestial Empire but many have also found a home serving the Rajs of Zahind where they form a well-entrenched warrior elite. Some still serve as faithful servants, especially as soldiers, but many more are now without a purpose and try to ﬁnd a reason for their existence. Dragonborn resemble humanoid dragons complete with limited breath weapon abilities. They’re covered in scaly hide, have long non-prehensile tails but lack the great wings of their draconic ancestor. They are tall and strongly built, usually standing between 6 and 7 feet in height and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talon-like claws with three ﬁngers and a thumb on each hand. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 128 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. A dragonborn’s head features vary as much as those of real metallic dragons but all dragonborn have a blunt snout and a strong brow, and distinctive frills around the cheek and ear. Some may even have short, horn-like protusions A dragonborn’s eyes are a shade of red or gold. During the Demon Wars, ﬁrst generation dragonborn more strongly resembled their ancestors, especially in terms of scale colour, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniﬁed appearance in modern times (i.e. 576 CY), with common scale colours being brassy, pewter, brownish-gold, or copper-green. Strongly blooded individuals, whose coloration (and sometimes appearance) again calls to mind their metallic ancestors, do occasionally appear and are considered marked by destiny. Outside of Zahind and the lands of, and bordering, the Celestial Empire, Dragonborn

suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or monstrous appearance (See page 110). Metallic Dragonborn Traits Dragonborn with metallic ancestry lay claim to the unﬂinching tenacity of the metallic dragons—brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver—whose hues glint in their scales. Theirs is the ﬁre of hearth and forge, the cold of high mountain air, the spark of inspiration, and the scouring touch of acid that cleanses and puriﬁes. You have the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Age. Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80. Alignment. Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil. Metallic dragonborn are most often good. Size. Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Metallic Ancestry. You trace your ancestry to a metallic dragon, granting you a special magical afﬁnity. Choose one type of dragon from the Metallic Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits as shown in the table. Ancestry Breath Weapon Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Gold Fire Silver Cold Breath Weapon. When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of a magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modiﬁer + your proﬁciency bonus. A creature takes 2d8 damage of the type associated with your Metallic Ancestry on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (3d8), 11th level (4d8), and 17th level (5d8). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proﬁciency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you ﬁnish a long rest. Chromatic Dragonborn ? The creation of the Dragonborn was always a ploy of Tiamat’s to check two enemies at once: the forces of the demon lord Ablis in the west and the demon- worshipping Torhoon in the east. With the Empyrean Jiao remaining on Oerik following the binding of Ablis into the Demon Wall, Tiamat opted to loose her creations in the lands once ruled by the ancient Torhoon where they slaughtered and replaced the native Olman. Few sages on Oerth know of their existence and what the evil Dragon Queen has in store for her creations remains unkown. See the DM’s Guide to Oerik. Draconic Resistance. You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Metallic Ancestry. Metallic Breath Weapon. At 3rd level you gain a second breath weapon. When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of a magical gas in a 15-foot cone. The save DC for this breath is 8 + your Constitution modiﬁer + your proﬁciency bonus. When you use this ability, choose one:

❉ Each creature in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked prone.

❉ Each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn. Once you use your Metallic Breath Weapon, you can’t do so again until you ﬁnish a long rest. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Suh and

Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 130 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. so  dwarves are known as staunch defenders when their communities are threatened. Dwur have found themselves almost constantly thrust into this role throughout their history. Other races, particularly euroz and jebli, have long coveted the dwur mines and homes. The history of these wars is ancient, but largely unknown to non-dwarves because the battles have been fought underground or in remote mountain ranges. Every dwur is taught enough history to hate orcs and goblinkind, and at the age of 30, every dwarf capable of holding a weapon receives gruelling training in the ﬁghting techniques most useful to counter orc, half-orc, goblin, and hobgoblin standard ﬁghting techniques. In everyday life, dwur are taught to be loyal to the clan and the gods ﬁrst, the dwur race second, and other allies third. They typically spend their days either defending against or raiding enemy humanoids, travelling to conduct trade with humans or noniz, making music, telling tales and drinking, or prospecting down a mine (or harvesting ironwood for the Korobokkuru). Mining and the attendant riches are the most critical part of the hill and mountain dwarven economy, as they use both standard mining technology and their own particular forms of magic. Both Bwan and Korobokkuru are unlike their Flanaess kin in that they eschew life beneath the oerth and instead focus their artisan skills to forestry and woodworking pursuits. The dwur of the east recognize twelve deities, the most commonly worshipped being Moradin the All-Father, Clanggedin Silverbeard (god of battle and honour), Dunathoin (god of mining), Berronar (demi-goddess of home and clan), and Ulaa (goddess of hills and mountains). Bwan have no known gods instead being led spiritually by Shamans while the Korobokkuru clerics are all of the Nature Dwur (Dwarves) The dwur of Oerth, as is commonly known, are a highly structured, lawful society, usually based on clan lines. Those of the Flanaess being materialistic, grim, and hard-working, are a militaristic people, endlessly engaged in wars against each other, humans, and many different humanoid and giant races for control of the vast mineral wealth in the mountains and hills where they make their home. Communities of hill dwur can be found across most of eastern Oerik and their cultures will vary depending on region. These hardy dwarves also have established colonies as far west as the Tyurzi mountain range. The mountain dwur are exclusive to the Flanaess region of eastern Oerik while the enigmatic Korobokkuru are exclusive to the far west, hailing from the wilderness regions of Pesh, Wunan and Minyeo. Finally there are the jungle and cloud forest dwelling Bwan hailing exclusively from Hepmonaland. Amongst themselves, the dwur can show a capacity either for great solidarity (such as among some elements of the Hateful Wars, in the Hestmark and Hollow Highlands, the Principality of Ulek, the Yatils, the Iron Hills, etc.) or great civil war (the Hateful Wars, the Crystalmists, deep within the Rakers, etc.) Interclan politics are of the highest importance to dwarves, and great politicians have been able to form lasting bonds between them, such as the clans who eventually united under a dwur prince to form the Principality of Ulek. Dwur in the west tend to be insular and often avoid interactions with outsiders. The community is highly valued by dwur, often valued over the individual, Chapter Two: Playable Races 131 domain (they worship the divinity of nature as a whole and not a single deity). Hill and mountain dwur live in either grand citadels and mansions carved from the stone, or tunnel networks made from older mine shafts. They have the same businesses you will ﬁnd in any human city, and indeed some innkeepers proﬁt from renting accommodation to the taller humans who may come to visit.  For matters of food, they have little problem with looting the food supplies of their enemies, hunting underground monsters (minotaur lizard is surprisingly delicate and succulent) or even growing their own limited supplies of grains, tubers, fungi and hardy vegetables. Gathering water is done by tapping melt-water glaciers in both cold and temperate zones, and/or by drawing Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 132 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. water from underground streams and channels. The dwur constitution is such that they need less water than humans to live on. Needless to say, the dwur can also trade gems and gold for additional food or water if needed.  Korobokkuru and Bwan, both living above ground, ﬁnd resources as other surface  races do, usually by foraging in the forests or growing their own vegetables and herbs on small garden plots (note Korobokkuru have vegetarian diets). Eastern dwur do not view gender as other races do. In fact, for many non-dwur, it can sometimes be difﬁcult to discern between a male dwur and a female.  Both sexes have similar external appearances; both are usually muscular and robust and both have facial hair although on females it tends to be sparse and ﬁner than amongst the menfolk. Males normally wear intricate beards. In fact, one form of criminal punishment enacted by dwur is the shearing of the convicts beard. While some Korobokkuru have beards, many instead favour long, pencil- thin moustaches. Bwan generally remain clean shaven with short tufts of a beard showing through on some individuals.

The status quo is very important to dwarves. What is important to dwur today is important because it was centuries ago. Traditions tell a dwur when to wake up in the morning, when and what to eat, and how to comb his beard. There are at least 300 beard styles, each with signiﬁcance in dwarven culture. While dwur form marriage  bonds and procreate as other races do, their culture also not only allows, but encourages, intimate and deep bonds between members of the same gender. Many dwur form such bonds with their brothers in arms during war and these relationships can be as committed and important as the relationship between husband and wife. Paradoxically,  in some of the more evil mountain dwur clans, these same-sex relationships amongst males are preferred and   women are sadly forced into very repressive roles in which they have little social freedom. They are expected to be child-bearers and little else, either working at the loom, the forge, or other means of producing food and goods while the men conduct all the affairs of political and social life. These are thankfully the exception however as the vast majority of dwur culture is as egalitarian as an elf or halﬂing community would be. Dwarves can either deal with other clans as brothers, or with a poisonous hate that exceeds even that of their enmity with the jebli and the euroz. They generally get on well with gnomes, although some gnomes resent the perceived paternalism they receive at the hands of some dwur. Most dwur and olves prefer to avoid each other at all times, the exceptions being some of the Chapter Two: Playable Races 133 dwur of the Yatils and their elven friends in the Vesve, or the dwur of the Hestmark and Hollow Highlands, the olves of Sunndi, and the dwur of the Iron Hills. When it comes to humans and halﬂings, the attitudes can vary from great friendship to great dislike, depending on the attitudes of the other race. The Korobokkuru of the far west tend avoid interactions with all other races though they are regularly forced to deal with humans for trade. They are the tireless enemies of the bakemono (the Suh word for goblinkind). Dwarves also love mining, especially for precious metals. Copper, silver and gold are okay, but every dwarven miner dreams of ﬁnding a new vein of adamantine. This preoccupation extends beyond mining. Dwarven craftsmen pursue the strongest and sturdiest building materials. Aesthetic value is often forsaken as dwarven architects strive for durability. Despite rumours to the contrary, most dwarves are not superstitiously afraid of magic, nor are they envious because they cannot cast spells themselves for despite their reputation, dwarves are not “non- magical”. They do not, for instance, hate and loathe all magecraft, but rather the kind normally practiced by most humans and elves. Dwarves favour magic which wards, such as the spells they used to protect their ancient tombs and mines, or which protects. Dwur use magic to convert rock into fertile soil for cultivation, to search out veins of ore underground, to gather water, and of course when crafting their incredible weapons and armor (see the Moradin’s Blood bloodline under the Sorcerer subclass in Chapter Five: Magic). Gnomes might solve many of these problems with their “technology”, but dwur use actual spellcasting in this regard to aid them. Dwur elders hold the race’s history. In eras past the entire history of clans would be recorded on massive stone slabs. Since the Cataclysms the original histories have been lost, and histories are now recorded on parchment in ink. Traditionalist dwarves are distressed by this recent change, fearing how easily such records can be destroyed. During the Age of Great Sorrow, some dwur, such as those allied with what would become the Iron League, were happy to assist their human allies in throwing off Aerdi-imposed shackles, while others, who had proﬁted greatly from trade with the honourable lords of Ratik and Bone March, assisted the other way. The Crystalmist clans continued to ﬁght each other, as always, while with the rise of Iuz in the 450s CY, dwur leaders in the Yatils gathered in a grand conference in 495 CY. Most of them signed a document declaring support for Furyondy and their olven friends in the Vesve against Iuz, a pact they have kept to this day. Many also aided the Perrenders in overthrowing the Archmage Iggwilv in Perrenland, and also worked with many in Ket to block her advance southward. The dwur of the Yatils have always been among the most honest, good and friendly in the Flanaess. The worst event to occur to the dwarven race occurred in 498 CY, with the incursion of the Hateful Wars. Historical sources correctly report that the dwarves acted in concert with the gnomes sharing the Lortmils with them and the elves of Celene and the surrounding forests to defeat the humanoids in the mountains. However, what they do no tell is of the tremendous greed for power many dwarven chieftains and kings engaged in. Playing deadly political games with the lives of their citizens, each other, and their allies in the war to attempt to gain the best vacated halls for themselves, or increased political prestige and power, or simply to Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 134 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. avenge old feuds that had existed since time immemorial. By 509-510 CY, when the war was all but won, some dwarves were more concerned with ﬁghting each other than the humanoids. As a result of this, the dwur of the Lortmils and the olves of Celene do not, in large part, speak to each other. Some clans have become sworn enemies, and do not speak to each other. Some noniz resent the paternalistic attitude and ruthless manipulations of their dwarven “allies”, and those offending dwarves do not receive aid from the gnomes, either. Their open kin in the Principality of Ulek are yet another party that has a score to settle with them. Sub-races

The dwur have four main subdivisions. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years. The hill and mountain dwarf sub-races are described in the PHB and may be played as presented in that tome. The Duergar, as presented in Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes, can be playable as well assuming the campaign is largely centred on the Underoerth and/ or evil-based.  As a subterranean race, the Duergar rarely venture to the surface world. Hill Dwarves The Hoydar-Dwur, or hill dwarves, are the most inﬂuential on the Flanaess. This is mostly due to their holding of the Principality of Ulek (they are also found widely in the Pomarj and Wild Coast). Humans have long claimed that a human king bequeathed this land to the dwarves, but the dwarves claim older rights. The Principality is famous for its gemstones, but more greatly prizes its adamantine mines. Those in the Little Hills of the Yeomanry, the dwarves have a strong presence and control that kingdom’s silver mines. The dwarves of the Abbor-Alz are believed to control a great wealth from gold, silver, and gemstone mines, but they are the most reclusive of the southern hill dwarves and hoard much of what they have. The dwarves of the Iron League control the gem mining in the Headlands of Onnwal, and the gold mining of the Hollow and Hestmark Highlands which circle the County of Sunndi. They are hard pressed by the South Province of the Great Kingdom, but maintain good trade with Ulek and human kingdoms along the Azure Sea. The Hoydar-Dwur tend to have dark Chapter Two: Playable Races 135 brown skin, black or grey hair, and average a little over four feet in height. Most other hill dwarves are called the Bydar-Dwur, or hill dwarves. These dwarves have adapted most closely to human civilization, living in or near human cities. Though proud of their dwarven culture, they are ﬂexible enough that they can ignore dwarven customs that would prove inconvenient when trading with other races. The Bydar-Dwur make the best dwarven PCs, as their ﬂexibility makes them best suited for multiracial parties. The Bydar-Dwur tend to have light- brown skin; brown, black, or grey hair; and average four feet in height. Eyes of hill dwearves are of any colour save blue. They are solidly built, though seldom exceed 4 feet in height. Hill dwarf populations are mainly found in the east of Oerik but some communities are known to exist along the Sunelan Coast Mountain Dwarves The Fjelldar- Dwur are the isolated mountain dwarves. These dwarves live as if under a state of siege, forgoing contact with most other races. The mountain dwarves of the Barrier Peaks truly are besieged by monsters, while the dwarves of the Glorioles have chosen to shut themselves off from the oppressive Great Kingdom rather than seek other allies as the hill dwarves in that region have done. This mentality of being “dead to the world” makes the dwarves both fatalistic and forlorn. The dwarves of the Crystalmist also consider themselves Fjelldar, but they are not so cutoff from the outside world. The Crystalmist dwarves maintain good trade with Sterich. The Fjelldar,-Dwur tend to have deeply- tanned skin, brown or grey hair, and average four and a half feet in height. The Isdar-Dwur are the mountain dwarves of the northeastern ranges. They are the most militant of the dwarves. Perhaps someday they will end up like the Fjelldar-Dwur, for these dwarves are equally besieged by monster kind. However, the Isdar-Dwur of Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 136 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. the Rakers, the Griff, and the Corusk Mountains have never been isolated from each other, and draw on enormous strength from their numbers. They are known throughout the Flanaess as powerful ﬁghters and dragonslayers. The Isdar-Dwur tend to have lightly- tanned skin, brown hair, and average four and a half feet in height. Wild Dwarves Bwan-Dwur, also known as Jungle or Wild Dwarves, are a reclusive race of dwarves  found only in remote, hot jungle areas and cloud forests of Hepmonaland. Wild Dwarves are mahagony-skinned, short, and stout. Their bodies are often covered with ritual scarring and they use a foul-smelling grease to coat their skin  which serves to keep off insects, and also makes them hard to hold. Due to the climate of their homeland, they wear little clothing except their animal skins and grass or foliage woven skirts, which they plaster with mud. Wild Dwarves dwell in jungle trees and caverns. They are polygamous and do not form tribes or clans, but live in hunting bands with ever-shifting membership. Each group carries a large water-bladder and a “talking drum”, to call other bands to a ‘big kill’ or ‘great danger’. A typical hunting band knows of three or four watering-holes, a bathing-place, a shaded eating area with a ﬁre pit and several lookouts, a sleeping-cavern and several sleeping-trees hung with nets of interwoven vines. They also know of at least ﬁve “refuge-caverns” that run deep into the earth. Wild Dwarves are not known to worship any gods or goddesses. Wild Dwarves wear carved bone earrings, bracelets, and necklaces for adornment, reserving mined metal only for use in weapon- and tool-making or barter. The Bwan eat certain fruits, berries, roots, leaves, and saps, and all manner of insects, worms, jungle birds, reptiles, and animals. Some have been known to eat humans, but they are not cannibals and do not usually eat intelligent beings. They consider most snakes delicacies, and make fermented fruit-wines in earthenware jugs. Wild Dwarves like to use pits, snares, dead-falls, and other traps to defend their home caves. All of these are tailored from the jungle surroundings and are very effective, even against victims of high levels, especially those uninitiated Chapter Two: Playable Races 137 to jungle combat. They prefer to attack in large groups, ﬁring darts from behind cover until an angered target charges them whereupon they attack from all sides. Wild dwarves often keep wild cats, such as leopards, as pets. In fact, it is taboo for them to hunt jungle felines. Bwan mistrust folk of other races and rarely leave the conﬁnes of their hot, shady jungles willingly. They sometimes trade for metal or glass objects in exchange for skins, meat, or captured animals. Ever cautious of outsiders, they will generally only enact trade in their own territory and will set traps in case of betrayal Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 1. Languages.

Korobokkuru The dwur sub-race known as Korobokkuru reside exclusively to the far west of Oerik where they hail from the wilderness regions of Wunan and the Kingdom of Taolaak. Korobokkuru traits can be found below. Korobokkuru Traits Korobokkuru are about the same size as most dwarves, but leaner, and dress in baggy, comfortable clothes. They live more in the wilds and exposed to the elements than their eastern kin, so they favour natural ﬁbres in natural colours such as greens and browns in their clothing. They are quite hairy, and their hair is often unkempt and wild, rather than the tamed, stylized hair of their cousins. The one exception to this is their long, meticulously groomed and waxed moustaches or beards. Culturally, Korobokkuru are a rustic peasantfolk. They mostly live in simple villages or camps in the wilderness, anywhere from lakes to mountainsides to valleys and forests, where they make a living through logging, farming and hunting. They are consummate anarchists and reject all but individual authority. Korobokkuru communities are governed by councils of equals who require consensus from all clan members for major decisions. Most other races ﬁnd Korobokkurus primitive and inferior, and rarely embrace them as equals. In return, they’ve become insular and don’t often seek interaction with outsiders. They particularly despise bakemono (goblinoid) creatures and initially react to other races with suspicion. Members of other races need to earn their trust. Korobokkuru society does not have priests at all, as all religious services are Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 138 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. performed by heads of their households. However, Korobokkuru do have a sorcerous blood running through some clans and those born with magical power are known as T’usu.

Individual Dwur populations and kingdoms The Crystalmists: The dwarves here are often very well-disposed to other races, and dwarves from outside the Crystalmists, but the bitter clan feuds they have with others who share their range has caused deep social scars. Raids and even occasional wars ﬂare up between these clans, and an endless cycle of hard-edged politics is evident. The Lortmils: As a result of the deadly political games and the trauma of the Hateful Wars, the dwarves of this region are a mixed bag. Many, as well as their kin in the Principality of Ulek, are good, friendly, jolly folk, always as ready to kill a goblin as to raise a tankard to humans who visit. Others are sour, evil-tempered, and both greedy and wealthy enough to rival even the worst moneylenders of Dyvers. The alignments and dispositions of the dwarves here vary more than any other. The Yatils: In the western part of this region, the dwarves tend to keep to themselves, though they will greet and help travellers who visit them, and conduct trade with their Baklunish neighbours. Their mannerisms seem to be more Baklunish than dwur these days, as do their dress and custom. The dwarves of the eastern Yatils are friendly, good and open, Chapter Two: Playable Races 139 as willing to welcome an elf as a fellow dwarf. Having good-aligned neighbours in Furyondy, Veluna and the Vesve has rubbed off on them, and their old pact of alliance against evil in the north stands as strong today as it did almost a century ago. The Griffs: The dwarves of this region are a mixed bag-some are (or were, depending on what you know) with the Duchy of Tenh, and were valued, if distant, allies. The dwarves deeper in the mountains are among the most vile of their kin, and have been that way almost since the beginning of recorded history. The wars between settled dwarves and new arrivals were the worst here, and the most evil of the bearded folk seem to have settled here: They, along with some of the Lortmils dwarves, take part in and move along the slave trade, often buying young human or elven women for “companionship” in the cold winter nights. Their hatred of humans and elves is well-known. The Rakers: In keeping with the region’s rough character, these fellows are strong, robust, noble and brave. They respect decisiveness and force of personality and action, being allied with gnomes and Ratikkan men who share the same ideals. One of their goals has, since 563 CY, been to reclaim Bone March, and many of them are the best allies the Bone March expatriates have, Count Dunstan often guesting at the homes of particular dwarven dukes and kings. The Hollow and Hestmark Highlands: The dwarves here are suspicious and grim for the most part, but if and when they give their oath of friendship to an outsider, it is as if the visitor is one of them. Strongly allied with the people of Sunndi and others in the Iron League, they are heavily armed and unforgiving in dealing with the Scarlet Brotherhood, the Aerdi, humanoid incursions, or any other foe. The Iron Hills & Glorioles: Led by the great Holgi the Hirsute, these hill dwur are similar in disposition, being open and welcoming to all other races. The dwarves of the Glorioles, on the other hand, are allies only be necessity, having nothing but disgust for elves and contempt for their kin in the Iron Hills. They are strongly isolationist, desiring to only have fellow dwarves visit their halls, closing their gates to all others without question. Only the eternal Aerdi threat has caused them to aid their neighbours in the past. Wunan: Korobokkuru are found only in the far west of Oerik in the wilderness of the region known as Wunan. There they live in small villages, where they grow vegetables, hunt,  ﬁsh and harvest exotic timbers for trade with the human nations of the region. Each village is independent but often maintain friendly contact with each other. Each village is led by a council of clan members.  The Korobokkuru are in a state of eternal warfare with the manh bakemono tribes of the region. Firbolg Firbolg of Oerth differ from those described in Volo’s Guide to Monsters. Of all the giant-kin, the Firbolg are the most powerful, due to natural intelligence and considerable magical power. Firbolgs generally appear to be normal humans, except that they are between 7 and 8 feet Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 140 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. tall and can weigh over 300 pounds. They usually wear their hair long and keep great, thick beards. Their skin is a range from a faint greenish hue to tan, with any shade of hair colour, although blonde and red are most common. Their voices are a smooth, deep bass, thick with rolling consonants. Firbolgs are cautious and crafty. They live in remote forests and hills with populations of them in the Celadon, Gambodge and Oytwood forests however they are a shy and reclusive people having little to do with outsiders. They keep on even terms with druids and the faerie creatures, including olves, neither asking nor giving much, but avoiding insult or injury. Strangers are met with caution, frequently in illusionary disguise as one of their own race. They do not attack or kill without reason, but do enjoy pranks, particularly those that relieve strangers of treasure. Firbolg society is close-knit and centered around the family or clan. Each clan numbers between 12 and 36 members and frequently a spiritual leader (normally an Archfey warlock or druid). The clans live apart from each other, existing as gatherers and sometimes nomads. Their homes are huge, single-storey, wooden houses with stout walls and a central ﬁreplace opening in several directions in the common room. When great decisions are needed, the clans involved meet in an enclave. This happens at least once a year at the autumnal equinox, just to celebrate if nothing else. The shamans preside over these events, and settle any disputes between clans. Firbolgs live off the land and with it. Their homes are built from trees cleared from around the house. The clan does keep a ﬁeld for harvest, but only enough to supplement their diet. They trade tasks involving great strength for food, usually with other peaceful folk in the forests or hills. The rest of their food is obtained by gathering and hunting an area up to 20 miles from their homestead. Meat is used in small quantities for most meals, although major celebrations always include a large roast of some sort. Although many creatures are capable of killing a ﬁrbolg, none hunt them exclusively. They are stronger than most forest beasts, and intelligent creatures Chapter Two: Playable Races 141 know better than to mess with them. They avoid true giants, except storm giants, and aggressively repel other giant-kin from their lands. Firbolg suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or  monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Firbolg Traits Your ﬁrbolg character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. As humanoids related to the fey, ﬁrbolg have long lifespans. A ﬁrbolg reaches adulthood around 30, and the oldest of them can live for 500 years. Alignment. As people who follow the rhythm of nature and see themselves as its caretakers, ﬁrbolg are typically neutral good. Evil ﬁrbolg are rare and are usually the sworn enemies of the rest of their kind. Size. Firbolg are between 71/2 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 260 to over 350 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Firbolg Magic. You can cast detect magic and disguise self with this trait, using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for them. Once you cast either spell, you can’t cast it again with this trait until you ﬁnish a short or long rest. When you use this version of disguise self, you can seem up to 3 feet shorter than normal, allowing you to more easily blend in with humans and elves. Giant Warriors. You are proﬁcient with spears, clubs and great clubs.  In addition, when wielding human- sized weapons that have the versatile trait one-handed (like longswords for example), you use the damage die as though the weapon were being wielded two-handed. If you have the two-weapon ﬁghting proﬁciency, you gain this beneﬁt with both hands. Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Speech of Beast and Leaf.

Genasi Descendants of rare unions between mortals and the elemental races of genies, the Saab Sirat as they are known in Ancient Baklunish, possess a natural array of elemental abilities and afﬁnities based on that ancestry. No two genasi are alike in appearance. Most appear almost human, bearing the marks of their Baklunish ethnicity; but, their elemental nature is impossible to fully hide. Their heritage is nearly always evident in one or two physical traits such as skin or hair colour or an elemental aura. Some genasi do not have hair at all; for such genasi, the substance that appears to cover their heads is actually a supernatural expression of their elemental nature. Genasi suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or  monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 142 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Genasi characters should be limited to originating in the Baklunish lands but can otherwise be used as written in the Elemental Evil Player’s Companion. The following additional sub-races are optional: Dust Para-Genasi Dust para-genasi tend to be morbid and sarcastic. They are most often neutral, but many of them have a slightly chaotic bent. They are pale and gaunt, with hollow cheeks and dark circles under their eyes. They usually have at least one or two traits that hint at their ancestry, such as perpetually dry skin or a cloud of dust that clings to them wherever they go. They almost always dress in black, and more often than not they wear funeral garb, even when such garb would be highly inappropriate. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 1. Breathless. Dust para-genasi do not breathe, so they are immune to drowning, suffocation, and attacks that require inhalation (such as some types of poison). Blinding Breath. You can exhale a 15- foot cone of blinding dust as an action and you regain the ability to do so after a long rest. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 + your proﬁciency bonus Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can use the ability a number of times equal to your proﬁciency bonus and regain the ability to do so on a long rest. Ice Para-Genasi Ice para-genasi are cold, emotionless beings Like most genasi, they tend toward neutrality. They appear human, but their features are often sharper and more chiselled than normal, Chapter Two: Playable Races 143 and their skin is paler than the norm for their race. In addition, they have one or two minor supernatural traits that hint at their heritage, such as breath that frosts in even the hottest weather or frost- caked hair. They prefer loose, light clothing in whites and pale blues, even in cool climates. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 1. Ice In Your Veins. You have resistance against cold damage. Frosty. You know the Frostbite cantrip. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for it. Magma Para-Genasi Ponderous but powerful. magma para- genasi combine many of the traits of their earthen and ﬁery ancestors. Like all para- genasi. they tend toward neutrality. They are usually short and stocky, sometimes to the point of resembling tall dwarves. They usually have dark skin, and they typically possess traits that mark them as unusual. They might have a reddish glow to their skin or eyes, feel unusually hot to the touch, or have hair that ripples like ﬁre. They tend toward simple, utilitarian clothes, which often seem disturbingly close to smouldering. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 1. Darkvision.

You can cast the Searing Smite spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it when you ﬁnish a long rest. Ooze Para-Genasi Ooze para-genasi are repulsive and slimy (both physically and in personality). They are most often neutral, but they have a slight tendency toward evil. They are usually heavyset, with ﬂabby bodies and sallow skin. Most exhibit a small number of traits that hint at their ancestry, such as greasy skin or unusually ﬂexible limbs. They wear dark earth tones, and their clothing is often soiled and foul smelling. They are, on a whole, utterly revolting. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1. Slimy. You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) rolls to resist grappling attempts. Greasy. You can cast the Grease spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it when you ﬁnish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

They tend to have dark skin and hair, and like other genasi have one or two unusual traits, such as hair that billows like clouds of smoke or the faint whiff of something burning clinging to them. They prefer loose clothing in dark colours and heavy fabrics. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Darkvision. Smoke para-genasi can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Breathless.

They tend toward neutrality, like their elemental forefathers. Steam para- genasi are usually tall and slim, and often weigh less than their appearance suggests. Like other para-genasi, they have one or two unusual traits, such as wisps of mist constantly clinging to them or a grey tone to their skin or hair. Their clothing is usually loose, ﬂowing, and gauzy. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Darkvision. Steam para-genasi can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Keen Eyed.

You can cast the Misty Step spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it when you ﬁnish a long rest. Gith Thousands of years ago there existed a great empire called Zarum in Western Oerik, where a race of humanoids dominated many other races from their capital city of Anithor. These humanoids seem to have been divided into a rigid caste system, their lives ruled by ancient ritual. The ruins of Zarum overﬂow with sacred spaces and temples, though the names of their ancient gods are unknown today. At some point, the illithids invaded Zarum from a neighboring plane of existence. Though the natives fought ﬁercely, they were no match for the psionic might of the mind ﬂayers, and soon they were enslaved. The River of Angry Souls is a remnant of one of the terrible battles between the illithids and the soon-to-be enslaved Zarumites. These slave-warriors fought many wars for the illithids and they became battle- hardened and increasingly psionically adept. The illithids became more brutal in order to ensure their slaves remained obedient, which only invited more revolts and more brutal reprisals. Then came Gith. Some say she was the personal bodyguard of a powerful illithid noble, while others claim she was only a lowly foot soldier and little more than a child. But her mental and physical powers were great, and her rage, hatred, power, and charisma was sufﬁcient to guide the thralls to victory. The illithid empire was shattered by the slave rebellion (remembered by them as the Thrall Uprising). Not every illithid stronghold fell, but the ties that bound the empire together were broken, and even today the mind ﬂayers have not recovered from that ancient war. They hid themselves away in the Underdarks of countless worlds, vowing to rebuild their strength and take vengeance against their treacherous former slaves, something they have not managed to do. Eventually, two rival factions of the rebellious slaves coalesced, one behind Gith, the other behind a holy-man named Zerthimon.  A great civil war erupted that spanned the planes. After countless centuries the two factions had devolved considerably from each other; the followers of the warrior-queen known as the githyanki, or “followers of Gith” and those of the holy-man as the githzerai, or ““those who spurn Gith”. Being extra-planar beings both Gith sub-races wouldn’t normally ﬁt the Chapter Two: Playable Races 145 traditional feel of a Greyhawk campaign however they remain a playable option with DM approval. Perhaps they were marooned on Oerth by some accident or as a test; or perhaps they hail from a secret subterranean or wilderness outpost that was setup to hunt or track illithid. Githyanki played a signiﬁcant part in the recent Priestess Wars in the city of Erelhei-Cinlu, allying with the drow house of Tormtor against their rivals, the Kilsek, who had allied themselves with the illithids. Gith suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or  monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Goliath The Lortmils have always been famous for their gems and precious metals, and stories abound of hidden settlements in which the dwarves, gnomes, or halﬂings are as rich as kings. Some of these have a ﬁrm basis, though in fact the wealth of the inhabitants is greatly exaggerated. Gems and gold are worth a good deal less near their source of supply, and the expense of safe export is high, even since the Hateful Wars of 520 CY. Nevertheless, one of the more extravagant tales is, in fact, true. The 20 mile wide valley of Esmeren lies hidden amongst the slopes of the nearby mountains clad in thick forests prone to dense fog.   The only passes require one to scale sheer cliffs or seek out secret passages hollowed into the rock. In either case, the high altitude is debilitating to most non-natives, and the entire way is guarded. The only other means of entry to the land of Esmerin is by means of a river Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 146 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. which ﬂows through underground caverns after disappearing near a whirlpool in Esmerin’s eastern quarter. This is certainly a route even more difﬁcult. As for views from the air, only the giant eagles and the Aarakocra are likely to gain such. The inhabitants include tallfellow halﬂings and the only known clan of extended families of Goliaths on the Flanaess. Unlike the more nomadic and barbaric types as described in the Volo’s Guide to Monsters the Goliaths of the Flanaess live a more sedentary life normally hidden away from the rest of the world. Goliaths outlined in Volo’s hail from the near- mythical kingdom of Behow somewhere near the “Top of the World” in western Oerik where they are zealous adherents to the faith known as The Way and live a wandering, monastic lifestyle. Goliaths are not giants but it may be hard to persuade creatures of lesser stature of that fact. Where giants are somewhat clumsy and plodding, Goliaths are deft and ﬂeet. A Goliath stands between 7 and 8 feet tall and weighs between 300 and 400 pounds. They live to up to 150 years. A Goliath may be immediately distinguished by its skin, which is marked by patterning and striations. The Goliaths of Esmeren typically serve as either hunters or miners in Esmeren vale. Hunting clans are usually found in the high mountains. Miners spend their days mostly underground.  Both groups get along well and are allied with the Tallfellow halﬂings that populate the central part of the valley and Esmeren- town. Some Goliaths show an aptitude beyond herding or mining and this minority live primarily in Esmeren-town itself although a few loners have cabins or small towers on the edges of the valley. Here they work as sages, wizards and druids doing research in The Great Library of Esmeren or performing experiments in labs scattered around the town. The Goliath-Halﬂing civilization has existed since before the Bakluni-Suel wars, and has been isolationist since its inception. The two races have somewhat inﬂuenced one another, to the point where many of the Halﬂings have decidedly Chapter Two: Playable Races 147 neutral tendencies and the Goliaths lawful and good tendencies. They do not like to take lives, but will ﬁght hard to maintain their peaceful isolation. Both peoples are essentially integrated. All are well-fed, well-educated, healthy, peaceful, and there are an usually high number of exceptional individuals among the population. With the above noted cultural changes, Goliaths can be played as presented in VGtM. Goliath suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Hobniz (Halﬂings) The halﬂings of the Flanaess, also known by the Flan as the hobniz, are an often forgotten people among the tumultuous politics of the Flanaess. As is commonly known, no halﬂing-ruled states exist in the Flanaess, at least none that have appeared in contemporary historical accounts. Thus, their culture is to a certain extent overlooked. Lightfoots average just over 3 feet tall and are ruddy faced, with hair and eyes in various shades of brown. The next most common sort are the stouts, somewhat shorter than lightfoots and having broad features and coarse hair. Last are the tallfellows, who are taller, slimmer, and have fairer complexions than lightfoots. Most halﬂings have wavy or curly hair. Some, particularly stouts, also grow hair on their cheeks. The halﬂings of the Flanaess, almost unique among all the other peoples except for certain Flan peoples, are matrilineal. Men are responsible for ensuring the harvest is gathered on time, for coordinating defense with other peoples, and taking the goods to market. Halﬂing women deal with ﬁnances, most dealings with other races and halﬂing tribes, festivals and religious observances, and the general social life of the tribe. Halﬂings live in small linked cabins and warrens built for their size, often joined into a vast network, with many murder holes and arrow slits for defense. Halﬂings reinforce this with stone walls and rigged booby-traps in more dangerous settings, when they do not live with humans and other races for mutual protection. Halﬂings are both master cooks and master farmers, and so, in return for protection from bandits and raiders, they will often provide excess goods and water to other peoples. The halﬂings are a very festive people, not concerned with grand military Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 148 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. traditions in the style of the Oeridians or the dwarves, for instance. Their natural lack of aggressiveness leads many people to view them as simple burrow-dwellers who enjoy nothing more than a simple pipe-smoke while sitting in an old oak armchair on the porch, watching the creek as it ﬂows by. Many halﬂings are indeed like this, and they are naturally charitable towards each other and those of other races who have proven themselves to be friendly neighbours, continually getting together for festivals and parties. People of any of the major Flanaess races can get on well with halﬂings, and the hair-footed folk are not inclined to be judgemental in any way regarding them. Stout halﬂings obviously tend to live more with dwarves and gnomes in hills and mountains, harfoots live with humans, and tallfellows are most often among the company of elves. The other side of the halﬂing character, however, is one of cunning savagery when their homes are threatened. Although most halﬂings are not inclined to be raiders themselves, they will often have well-rehearsed defensive plans to deal with bandits or goblin incursions, and can ﬁght ﬁercely in the defense of their own homes. The natural stealth of halﬂings means they have also served as scouts for their allies against common enemies, such as against the orcs of Iuz in the Vesve region, or in the Hestmark Highlands and the Grandwood against Aerdi incursions. Some halﬂings, albeit a minority, have a streak either of mischief or simple nastiness running through them—they can be sadistic little brutes, enjoying the chaos they can cause. Other halﬂings enjoy running off on wild adventures, and it is these who tend to enter the adventuring life, as natural rogues and thieves. Chapter Two: Playable Races 149 The peaceful history of the halﬂing people has been mostly characterized by their relations to humans. When the archmage Tzunk came from the Isles of Woe in the Nyr Dyv to threaten the surrounding states, the halﬂings of what is now Urnst were determined opponents. Most of the time, the halﬂings of modern Urnst fought bravely, but a line of baronesses were inclined to take the ﬁght to Tzunk himself, rather than to just defend themselves. These halﬂings “encouraged” all others to aid them, even to the extent of sending press- gangs to recruit other hobniz into their forces. Other halﬂings ﬂed into the region of Furyondy and Veluna, where goodly Flan men and halﬂings who already dwelt there kindly took them in. Others spread to the south and east, getting caught up in the battles between the Flan nation of Ahlissa against the undead forces of an unknown lich in  what is now the North Province of the Great Kingdom. These halﬂings withdrew to the hills, not wishing to die in human conﬂicts. Others moved to join the Flan men of Geoff, into the regions of Ulek, and some even went as far as the old Flan gathering place of Tenh, forming alliances with the people there. In every case, the halﬂing people preferred to get along with the inhabitants of the territories they entered, rather than enter into war. The precepts of unity practiced even in modern times by the people of Geoff appealed to the halﬂings who entered therein, while the wild warriors of modern Perrenland took the halﬂings in as a protected underclass. Those few who went to Tenh were given positions outside the lines of tribal politics, being allowed to keep to their own counsel. The outgoing halﬂings of Urnst formed alliance with the Suel that settled there, and those who moved into the Pawluck river valley and the surrounding regions also formed loose, but separate, alliances with the humans, gnomes and dwarves coming there. During the time of great Aerdy might and Keoland’s imperial phase, halﬂings were either treated well (Geoff, some parts of Sterich and Keoland proper, Viceroyalty of Ferrond, Duchy of Tenh, the Ulek states) or suffered under bigoted humans and dwarves (other parts of Sterich and Keoland, the Northern Reaches, Gran March, the provinces of Idee and Sunndi, among certain dwarves of the Lortmils). And so, the halﬂings, usually having no grand political ambitions of their own, Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 150 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. usually were happy to work with their human allies in ousting Aerdy oppression. Halﬂing politics are usually centered among local tribes and deal with local matters—only in Urnst and Geoff have they ever had any major inﬂuence on national policy. In this respect, with no grand political ambitions such as those exhibited by the dwarves and elves, halﬂings have not been inclined to pursue statehood in any real form. In this manner, their politics since the Age of Great Sorrow and the Turmoil Between Crowns has been in reaction to or part of human politics. Halfling Traits Your halﬂing character receives the normal traits as per the PHB however they also receive the following additional traits: Gourmande. You are natural in the kitchen and a wizard at mixing ingredients in new and appetizing ways. You gain proﬁciency with Cooks Utensils (Charisma is your modiﬁer). Sub-races Harfoot (i.e. Lightfoot) and Stout halﬂings can be played as presented in the PHB.  Tallfellow halﬂings are the least numerous upon the Flanaess.  They are found almost often exclusively in Highfolk though there are reputed communities in Celene as well. Harfoot This most common of hobniz live much as humans do but prefer rural settings and villages to towns and cities. Their crafts tend toward the ordinary and practical— farmers, millers, innkeepers, weavers, brewers, tailors, bakers, and merchants are common in Harfoot society. Averaging about 3’ in height, Harfeet are slightly stockier in build than is typical for humankind. Their complexions run the gamut from pale to very dark, with hair color correspondingly blond to black and eyes that are brown or hazel. They rarely wear shoes (only in bad weather and bitter cold) and can be easily distinguished by the thick patches of hair growing atop each foot. They have no facial hair (besides eyebrows and eyelashes, of course). They typically wear brightly coloured comfortable clothes, such as trousers and shirts or dresses, with a vest, jacket, hat, sash, or bonnet added as a ﬂourish. Their faces are round and very expressive, often appearing child-like to humans. Harfeet are only moderately industrious, but they tend to make up in talent for what they lack in drive. A Harfoot farmer may tend a small plot in the morning, for Chapter Two: Playable Races 151 example, and spend the afternoon lying in the shade—yet his or her irrigation ditch will be so cleverly aligned that his or her ﬁeld yields a crop equal to that of a much larger human-tended farm. A Harfoot- woven tunic will have a ﬁner weave and be less scratchy than a similar human product, thus fetching a considerably higher price. Harfeet are the hobniz most closely integrated into human society. They will work for human employers or hire human labourers, and many a Harfoot merchant has made his or her fortune by appealing to the human elite of a city’s population. While they will dwell in buildings in human neighbourhoods, Harfeet do prefer to live among others of their own race (though not necessarily their own sub-race) when this is possible. A Harfoot’s preferred type of house is the combined above and below ground burrow. The upper portion is almost always wood- framed, with several doors and windows and a bright, airy feel--though the ceilings are typically no more than 5’ above the ﬂoors. The lower portion will contain the ﬁreplace and several small, cozy rooms. Lacking the time, property, or means to build a traditional home, however, a Harfoot will cheerfully occupy a human house, a sheltered cave, or even a shack or tent. Wherever he or she lives, a Harfoot will ﬁnd a place to have a ﬁre and gather for social conversation. Stout Stouts are not as common as their cousins, the Harfeet, but they are nonetheless a populous and widespread sub-race. They are about the same height as Harfeet, averaging an inch or two below 3’, but much stockier—indeed, a typical Stout weighs half again as much as the average Harfoot! This girth is not all fat, however—Stouts are more muscular than any other halﬂing and tend to regularly best their kin in the wrestling contest that are a favourite Stoutish entertainment. Ruddier in complexion than the other sub-races, Stouts tend to blush easily when pleased or embarrassed and ﬂush bright red when angry. Their hair color tends to be on the light side, with blonds and sandy reds predominating; their eyes are blue, grey, and green. Unlike Harfeet and Tallfellows, male Stouts can grow some facial hair, although not full beards; usually it takes the form of unusually thick sideburns or muttonchops. Moustaches are rare, and the few able to grow them are often inordinately proud of their accomplishment. Stouts favour sturdy garb, commonly made of well-cured leather. They prefer practicality to appearance, and thus the members of a community tend to dress with an almost drab sameness. However, a Stout will try to make a point of having a brightly coloured outﬁt of exotic material (such as cotton, wool, or, rarely, silk), for use on special occasions. They often wear boots, which are really more like thick moccasins that offer good protection from the rocky or marshy ground typically under Stoutish feet. These halﬂings tend to segregate themselves from human society more than do Harfeet, preferring the company of dwarves. Stouts and dwarves mix very readily, and their communities will often be located near to each other. Military and defensive alliances between the two races are common, and prosperous trading is also the norm. Stoutish villages will generally be in hilly or rocky regions near good ﬁshing waters and well-watered ﬁelds. They are the only halﬂings with any afﬁnity to mining, but they are quite good at it and will often develop a bustling business from the Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 152 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. excavation of minerals. Stouts can also be skilled jewellers, stone-masons, builders, smiths, boatmen, and carvers. They are lacklustre farmers at best, except where mushrooms are concerned, and as merchants they excel primarily at selling the products of the above trades. Preferring underground habitation more than any other halﬂing sub-race, a Stout will typically live in a fully-excavated burrow. He or she will have several round, shuttered windows placed in a few walls to let in light and air, but the overall place will be cooler, darker, and somewhat damper than a Harfoot home. The most industrious of halﬂings, a Stout can accomplish a great deal of work in a short time. They make doughty soldiers, and their darkvision gives them a great advantage in night-ﬁghting. They are skilled swimmers and boatmen and have used small, slender canoes with great effect in night attacks against larger vessels. Tallfellow The hobniz of Highfolk are proud people. Since they are about half way between gnomes and dwarves in height (averaging4’ for an adult male), and slimmer than most halﬂings, they don’t call themselves “little folk” or other cute names. Known to outsiders as Tallfellows. This sub-race of hobniz is not so common as the Stout or Harfoot but exists in signiﬁcant numbers in many areas of temperate woodland. Averaging a little over 4’ in height, Tallfellows are slender and light-boned, weighing little more than the average Harfoot. They wear their hair long, often topped by a small brightly- coloured cap. The longest-lived of all hobniz sub-races, Tallfellows have an average life expectancy of 180 years, with the eldest exceeding 250 years. Unlike the other two sub-races, Tallfellows rarely go barefoot. Tallfellows favour woodland shades of brown, yellow, and green and have developed several vibrant shades of the latter colour through unique dyes. They enjoy the company of elves, and most Tallfellow villages will be found nearby populations of that sylvan folk, with a ﬂourishing trade between the two peoples. Preferring to live above ground, Tallfellows often dwell in spacious houses of wood, with many windows. Indeed, the ceiling of a Tallfellow house will typically be nearly 6’ above the ﬂoor! Though the Chapter Two: Playable Races 153 house will often have a cellar, this will be used primarily for storage. However, during days of hot summer Tallfellows will often retire to their underground chambers for a long evening’s conversation and sleep. Tallfellows display the greatest afﬁnity toward working with wood of any halﬂing. They make splendid carpenters (often building boats or wagons for human customers), as well as loggers, carvers, pipesmiths, musicians, shepherds, liverymen, dairymen, cheese-makers, hunters, and scouts. They are better farmers than Stouts (although not as good as Harfeet) and more adept than any other sub-race at harvesting natural bounties of berries, nuts, roots, and wild grains. The only halﬂings who enjoy much proﬁciency at riding, Tallfellows favour small ponies. Indeed, many unique breeds of diminutive horse have been bred among Tallfellow clans: fast, shaggy-maned, nimble mounts with great endurance. In a charge, of course, they lack the impact of a human-mounted warhorse; nonetheless, Tallfellow companies have served admirably as light lancers and horsearchers during many a hard-fought campaign. On foot, Tallfellows wield spears with rare skill. They are adept at forming bristling `porcupine’ formations with these weapons, creating such a menacing array that horses and footmen alike are deterred from attacking. This is one of the few halﬂing formations capable of standing toe-to-toe with a larger opponent in the open ﬁeld. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Individual Hobniz Populations Ahlissa (South Province): Most halﬂings toil as serfs on farms, with conditions little Herzog Chelor is unable, or not inclined,  to repeal most of the bigoted Aerdy laws towards non-humans, although he has taken steps to make sure abuses against commoners are more directed against other races than the halﬂing population as halﬂings tend to be hard workers and thus better farmers than many of the oerdian serfs.. Geoff: The halﬂings here are generous and friendly, living in harmony with the wilderness and all their fellow Geofﬁtes, regardless of race. They are well integrated into Geofﬁte society and several even serve among the prestigious Gryphon Riders of Geoff. Furyondy/Veluna/Highfolk: As you might expect, the halﬂings here are friendly, open, honest and good. Welcoming of strangers as if they were old friends, the hospitality of the Highfolk halﬂings, extending into western Furyondy and northern Veluna, is spoken of across the Flanaess. Gran March: The history of subtle discrimination in this nation has affected its halﬂing population, to the point where most of them left long ago for Veluna, Ulek or Keoland. The halﬂings who remain are even more likely to suffer from the Knights of the Watch than even the common folk, and the martial inﬂuence of the country does not bode well for them. Keoland: Halﬂings are a respected and viable part of the economy, and as such have beneﬁted from the new social reforms passed since King Kimbertos took the throne. Not Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 154 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. inclined to get involved in messy politics, the halﬂings prefer to keep to themselves and only get involved in local matters. Lordship of the Isles: The halﬁngs dwelling in this idyllic realm have little reason to get involved in the Duxchan-Sea Baron feuds, preferring to work in the plantations alongside the Olman and Suel savages brought from Hepmonaland. Another class of serfs, the halﬂings here are surprisingly content with their lot, some even proﬁting by engaging in the slave trade that has recently become more prevalent. Nyrond: The halﬂings of Nyrond have always, on one level, been serfs. They have had little chance to enter into politics, and they are not inclined to be anything but quiet and reserved, tending their farms and caring little for outside visitors. The only main contact they have with their sovereign is in the form of patrols to defend them when bandits come calling. Perrenland: As only male men, dwarves and gnomes are allowed to vote in Perrender elections, the halﬂings of this nation are a protected underclass. Centuries of a protective parent to helpful child relationship from human to halﬂing has beneﬁted both sides, and the halﬂings are content to live their lives in relative peace while the various clans bicker and feud. Perrenland’s stance towards the evil in the north does not really concern them-the halﬂings of this region are introspective and inward-looking; the name of Iuz does not get much of a reaction, although the name Iggwilv will, of course. Sterich: Sterich’s grim character, as well as the fact that a good deal of the old nobility of Keoland emigrated here over the centuries, means that its halﬂings are harder-edged and grimmer than most. As such, they are more martial than they might be otherwise. They are not, however, let into politics, for the most part. Sunndi/The Hestmark Highlands/ the Hollow Highlands/Idee: The folk of this region are decent, honest, hard-working halﬂings. They are active and valued allies of the Iron League in their deﬁance of The Great Kingdom.  Many halﬂings in this area are employed as scouts and saboteurs. Tenh: In Tenh, halﬂings are regarded as protected citizens. They are not required to serve in the military, have separate towns, and have a fair amount of autonomy for themselves, the Tenha only intervening when matters dictate they come together against outside enemies. Urnst: The halﬂings of the County of Urnst as opposed to the Duchy of Urnst reﬂect the human attitudes— those of the County, just like the humans, are friendlier and more outgoing than those of the duchy. They are less closed, less unilateral, and more trusting. They have direct links to Belissica’s government, though the humans and halﬂings are inclined to work separately. In the duchy, the halﬂings are among the most pro-active, bold, outspoken, and decisive of any of their kind in the Flanaess. They take an active role in politics, have considerable inﬂuence on national policy, and so forth. Many halﬂings even gained notoriety for enjoying patronage and kickbacks from Mayor Hadric in the Chapter Two: Playable Races 155 early 570s, before Duke Karll exiled the man. In this way, some of the halﬂings of the duchy have acted in an almost racist fashion against other races. The Celestial Empire: Western Oerik’s only halﬂing population is dispersed across the Celestial Empire where they toil primarily in rice cultivation.  These Hobniz are all of the Tallfellow variety. Humans Because the human tribes were scattered far and wide during the earliest migrations into eastern Oerik and the many wars since, intermarriage has been common in the thousand years since the Flannae met their Oeridian, Suloise and Baklunish counterparts. Except in isolated areas the races have not remained pure. In western Oerik Suhfeng, Baklunish, Zind and Murian blend to one degree or another. Suloise and Zind melded to form the Sunelans. Among humans, perhaps only the Touv and Olman can claim any kind of true racial purity and this due only to their isolation. There are areas where one of these cultures has remained dominant in the psyches of the inhabitants, so that they follow most or all of its customs and taboos. These are as are often but not always peopled by pure or nearly pure members of a single race, easily identiﬁable based on physical characteristics. In other places a family or nation may still think of themselves as Suel, Flan, Oeridian or Baklunish, even though they are genetically diverse. In other lands, two or more cultures have mingled without giving up their unique identities. In still others, the cultures have melded in such a way to produce a “generic” culture that might he said to the basic Flanaess civilization. The residents of  these last lands or groups do not bear the physical characteristics of any race, nor do they adhere to customs or taboos of any of the races. For many individuals, their religion, guild, profession or country of origin will be more important than their racial background, which they may not even know. Their concerns, customs and taboos are more likely to derive from these other aspects of their lives.

Humans characters, as described in the PHB are “the most diverse of all the races”, stemming from the fact that they come from varied ethnic and cultural groups. In Greyhawk Rebooted 576 CY5e a human’s ethnicity and cultural roots may affect that character’s physical attributes, starting languages, values (and, consequently alignment) and choice of character class. Players may opt to Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 156 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. play a “mixed race” Standard Human character as described in the PHB or they may choose to play as a Variant Human representing one of these ethnicities. Note that the Variant Human option presented in the PHB has been replaced with the human sub-race options below. Cultural Groups This section details the human racial groups of the Flanaess. The major continent of Greyhawk. There are few areas with pure racial groups extent on the Flanaess, save perhaps at the fringe areas of the continent. Of course, the races of demi-humans are relatively unmixed, but humankind, as is its wont, has industriously intermixed in the central regions to form a hybrid type that has actually become a signiﬁcant portion of the population. Standard human characters can be created as per the usual rules; this represents a character if mixed ethnicity. Alternatively, players could be of pure-blooded descent as follows: Baklunish The Baklunish, Baklun or Bakluni, all are interchangeable, have skin of bronze tones, and straight, ﬁne-textured hair that is universally dark, ranging from dusky brown to bluish black. Their eyes are usually green or gray-green; hazel and gray eyes are rare. They tend to be long of limb and facial feature, with high cheekbones. The Baklunish once held a great empire on the western side of the Crystalmists and Barrier Peaks. The Chapter Two: Playable Races 157 Invoked Devastation ruined their empire, for which the Baklunish retaliated with the Rain of Colourless Fire, burning the Suel Imperium to ash. Most surviving Baklunish moved north or west, to the borders of the old empire and beyond. The inhabitants of Ekbir, Zeif, Ull, and the Tiger Nomads typify the straight Baklunish strain, while the Tusmites and the Paynims show mixed ancestry. The Wolf Nomads are often darker from intermarriage with the Rovers of the Barrens. The Kettites are the least typical Baklunish, having pale yellow, golden- brown, or tan complexions as a result of Suh, Flan and Oeridian ancestry. The Baklunish, unlike the Suloise, retained much of their culture after the fall of their empire. The Baklunish tribes who settled on the Dramidj coast and environs brought with them a polytheistic religion where oerth and sky and all of the elements are sacred. There are no temples or churches in Baklunish lands.  Instead burnt offerings are offered to the gods on altars under the open sky. They offer sacriﬁces to four main “good” deities who are seen as aspects of one unifying force known as Istus, Lady of Fate. The four high gods of the Bakluni are:

❉Geshtai, goddess of rain, rivers and wells, representing elemental water;

❉Atar, god of the Sun, representing elemental ﬁre;

❉Suwat, god of mountains, metals and stone, representing elemental earth; and

❉Waadi, goddess of the moon, sky and wind, representing elemental air. These (and other) forces of good stand in opposition to the evil spirit of Dorgha Torgu (believed to be the Baklun name for Nerull) and his forces. There are numerous other minor gods, like Mouqol, god of trade; imported gods, like Xan Yae who was originally a Suhfeng goddess and; hero-gods, like Daoud and Zuoken, who was once a mortal devotee of Xan Yae. Others gods include Hasnat, god of music, poetry and song,  Hadyan, god of magic, knowledge and scholarship, Nasri, goddess of murder and banditry, Kadar, goddess of ﬁre, destruction and greed and Tensi, god of open spaces. Istus is both invoked and worshipped through a ritual known as the yazna (a meal to which the deity is invited). At the yazna, a drink called hauma is prepared from the juices of a plant native to the area around Tovag Baragu and consumed, altering the participants’ minds and allowing an apprehension of the divine. Fire, kindled at the yazna, is both a sacred element in itself and a manifestation of the divine presence in the form of Atar. For the Baklunish, the purpose of human life is to choose which deity one will follow, and this choice will then inform and direct all of one’s actions as well as one’s ﬁnal destiny. Baklunish children undergo between three to four hours of religious training per day between the ages of nine and fourteen. A personal patron deity is chosen in secret by each Bakluni child when they attain the age of fourteen. One who chooses Istus or her allies will live a life devoted to A’sha (truth and order) and will adhere to the practice of Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds. One who chooses Dorgha Torgu and his allies will live a life attached to Druj (lies and chaos), evident by self- indulgence, faithlessness, and power seeking. A paradox in Baklunish culture is the acknowledgment by all that evil is required in the world for without it there could be no good. A Baklun tries to Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 158 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. emulate the ideals of his personal patron deity in all things from the way they dress to what they eat to how the ﬁght or how they perform magic. The most common Baklunish idiom is: “As above, so below.” Honour, family, generosity, honesty and piety are fundamental virtues. Use of their classical language, Ancient Baklunish, in religious observance, higher learning, and the ﬁne arts has helped preserved their ancestral traditions. The Baklunish have many customs and taboos derived from their great knowledge of astrology, and their dependence on horses adds many beliefs and traditions regarding their honoured steeds, particularly among the nomads. Singing and dancing are widespread in their culture, and trade and exploration are major pursuits. Settled Baklunish favour bright patterns and gaudy colours in clothes, typically with gowns and robes or else long coats with short breeches. Lower classes use the same colours with a long one-piece garment supplemented with other garb. Nomadic Baklunish prefer clothes with several pastel colours, enjoying fancy garments enhanced with puffs, slashes on sleeves to show contrasting colours underneath, and superﬂuous trim. When traveling or making war, the nomads instead wear rough items of leather, hide, or cloth, bearing shields or banners indicating clan allegiance. Many skilled wizards are Baklunish, including experts in elemental magic, divination, and summoning and binding spells (used on extra-planar beings). Cooperative spell-casting is practiced by many of the clergy, particularly among the desert mystic sects. The Baklunish aristocracy is entwined in the intrigues of multiple Genie Lords and it is in the Baklunish lands where one is most likely to encounter Dao, Djinn, Efreet, Marid and their kin.

Flannae Pure Flannae have bronze skin, varying from a light copper hue to a deep nut brown. Flan eyes are usually dark brown, black, brown, or amber. Hair is wavy or curly and typically black or brown (or any shade between). The Flan have broad, strong faces and sturdy builds. Flan men often sport large, thick moustaches but prefer to be otherwise clean-shaven. Both men and women are known to adorn themselves with tattoos, usually of indigo or ochre colour. The Flannae (and their distant Olman kin) are the ﬁrst known humans to live in eastern Oerik, and it is from them that the Flanaess gets its name. Although it is common knowledge and there is ample archaeological evidence that they once had settled nations, those vanished long ago. The Flannae ﬁrst came to the attention of Suel historians when the Gyreff tribe led by their king, Bran, sacked a Suel city just west of the Crystalmists in -915 BCY, and again in -909 BCY. Several Flan tribes from the Fals River valley were frequent mercenary allies of the Baklunish against the Suel in the latter days of the Suel-Baklunish Wars. The Flan thus gained a reputation with Suel and Baklunish writers for being ﬁerce warriors and skilled horsemen who also ﬁelded chariots in battle. This reputation was largely responsible for the lack of interest by those other nations from exploring and expanding into the Flanaess. Being celebrated warriors, their early society did not exactly revolve around peace and quiet! The many tribes and kingdoms, often ruled by the Ur, or sorcerer class, were almost constantly ﬁghting amongst themselves, so much of Flannae life was Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 160 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Chapter Two: Playable Races 161 spent preparing for or ﬁghting in conﬂicts of varying scales. Blacksmiths, druids and bards were, and are still, the most esteemed members of society for the roles they play in warfare; the blacksmith for making weapons, the druids for making prophecies, and the bards for making epic tales about the victorious battles. From the founding of the ﬁrst Flan city of Hadaradagh until the fall of their last great kingdom of Ahlissa, there were between six and ﬁfteen Flan settled nations and perhaps twice as many nomadic nations on the Flanaess at any given time. Some of their best known were the Empire of the Spidered Throne (Vecna), the Kingdoms of Sulm, Itar, Nuria and Ahlissa and the tribal confederations of the Tenhas and the Gyreff. Kingdoms were known as “Tuan” in the Flan tongue and this term now refers to individual tribes rather than physical kingdoms. Individual members of a tribe today spend their days farming their land or looking after their animals (usually sheep, goats, horses and oxen). Family relationships are of the utmost importance for the Flannae, with every descendant of a great- grandfather having equal standing. The same is even true of the Ri, or King’s family; when a leader dies, all of his descendants are eligible to take the throne, so it is put up to the freemen of the nation to vote. This system was later adapted for their own use by the mixed ethnicity farmers of the Yeomanry. The Flan have their own governing system and laws known as Beoryn law, which is surprisingly extensive and complicated. It works on the basic principle that each person’s identity is deﬁned by the nation or tribe they live in. A peasant has no legal standing outside his or her tuan and they are bound to it by the Ri. Land is owned by families rather than individuals, and the penalty for crimes is usually a ﬁne of the family’s cattle or other livestock. War between the old tuan was a regular occurrence in ancient times, but never a long lasting ones. Some Flan were said Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 162 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. to be so ﬁerce in battle that they actually turned up naked, with only a spear in their hands! Every war was very well thought out and meticulously planned, and was only for the seasoned warriors to take part in; the ordinary folk were left to go about their business as usual. Violence between Flan nations today is uncommon except among the Rovers of the Barrens who still feud amongst themselves regularly. In most Flan territories, a central hilltop fort that is strongly fortiﬁed is the centre of the tribe. The fort is used as a residence for the local Ri, or as a refuge during times of war. They are wattle and daub structures (solidiﬁed mud strengthened with wood, with thatched grass on top as a roof), but are surrounded by a defensive stone wall and sometimes a moat or small lake. Other smaller and less well defended structures are built within the general vicinity of the main fort, and are used as general residences for the rest of the tribe. There is no doubt that the Flan love all things beautiful, and go to great lengths to produce intricately decorated pieces of jewellery, carvings on stones, and various other stunning objects. Among other things, they particularly enjoy crafting torcs—decorated rings of gold, silver or bronze that are worn around the neck — lunulae, a similar crescent shaped collar; and armlets. In their art, they’ve become very skilled at creating complicated interlacing patterns and symmetrical knot designs. Spirals and triskeles are also regular features of Flannae art. Large pockets of Flan live in what are now Geoff, Tenh, and the Barrens. The Tenha are pure Flan, and the coppery Rovers of the Barrens nearly so. The people of Geoff and Sterich also show strong Flannae heritage, as do the Stoneholders, Palish, Perrenders and certain Clatspur highland clans. The Flan have always been strongly tied to the natural world and they see nature as an entity to be respected but not controlled, and this is reﬂected in their myths, legends, and culture. Many Flan believe the season of a child’s birth affects later life, and certain customs and taboos must be observed annually. Modern Flan still have a preference for the outdoors, and those who live in cities usually raise gardens and ﬂower beds. A tree is planted at the door of a Flan home, and the health of that tree is believed related to the welfare of the family. Storytelling is a favourite pastime, and most families have ancient oral folklore and legends to pass on. The ancient, nomadic Flannae wore simple clothing of animal skins: belts, breech-cloths, capes, robes and footwear (boots and hard-soled slippers). Body painting and tattoos were common methods of personal decoration, and these traditions are still practiced by the Rovers of the Barrens (who prefer Chapter Two: Playable Races 163 yellows and reds). Modern Flannae tend to dress in what is currently fashionable, but they favour bright primary colours in solid arrangements. The Flan of the Quag Highlands in the Yatil Mountains are renowned for their colourful great kilts (not to mention their ﬁghting prowess) Flan wizards normally work in harmony with nature, avoiding destructive magic. A few delve into the necromantic arts of the ancient Ur, but such practices are shunned by respectable folk. Many prefer protective and divinatory spells, a practice that stems from their traditional roles of guarding nomadic tribes and helping them survive. Flan clerics are often druids, who are more accepting of agriculture than they once were. Like the sun god, Pelor, many Flan deities have strong natural aspects.

Murians Almost 10,000 years ago when humanity was still in its infancy, a nomadic people known as the Su had  found a temporary home on the eastern edge of what is today the Dry Steppes. This people was further split by unrelenting goblinoid attacks into the Su-el, people who ﬂed north, and the Su-feng people, who eventually found their way into the lands of what is today the Celestial Imperium. From fragments of artwork still remaining, it appears that the Su-el were a light-skinned and fair haired people and they were dogged ever northward by incessant goblinoid raids until they were ﬁnally pushed through the jungles of Komal and the humanoids ceased their pursuit. The earliest recorded name of the region beyond the jungles where they settled is Mur. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 164 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Most of the Su-el settled in the lower highlands, tending goats and growing olives and grapes.  Befriending the indigenous centaur tribes, within a few generations the Su-el had begun coalescing into towns and small palace complexes.  Just as their culture was beginning to take root, hordes of goblinoids descended on the Murian highlands from the southwest, burning many Su-el settlements and driving most of the people to the coasts which had recently been colonized by another early human tribe of unknown origin.  {Many scholars believe this people came from Telchuria while others believe them to be a proto-Baklunish people.} Conﬂict was inevitable and for centuries the region was awash in warfare as the coastal people tried to fend of the Su-el. A great majority of the Su-el people were rebuffed and pushed south, back  into the jungles of Komal through which their ancestors had ﬂed north. A few Su-el clans were successful however and over time this powerful minority came to dominate several coastal settlements which quickly grew into the ﬁrst city-states of Mura, Coreth and Thefal. Over centuries this new hybrid Murian culture evolved and expanded along the coast, out into the offshore islands and pushed back into the highlands with a vengeance, eradicating or enslaving the goblinoids they found there.  Many new settlements were established which grew into the myriad city-states that today make up the region. In reality, the term Murian only describes the upper echelon of the society for the vast majority of people living in Murian city-states are slaves, a minority of which are of Murian blood with the vast majority being Komali, Suh, Baklunish or one of the goblinoid races. Sources for slaves include slave raids and war captives, abandoned children, and in some city-states, the families of bankrupt debtors. Chapter Two: Playable Races 165 Slaves provide most of the work required to grow the Murian civilization. They work the mines, load and unload cargo from the ships, cultivate the ﬁelds, perform household chores, row many of the galleys, serve as junior craftsmen to many of the Murian artisans, act as personal attendants, and perform as entertainers. It is estimated that Mura has twice the number of male slaves as free men and even more slave women. Though the women do not perform the heavier physical labor, they serve as craft assistants, entertainers, attendants, and cloth makers. In some of the progressive city-states, many slaves are trusted enough to run small shops for their masters. As the Murian elite were freed from the manual labor required to maintain their civilization, they turned their attentions to other pass times, most notably war and violent forms of entertainment such as unarmed combat, mounted aerial duels and gladiatorial games. As they pushed further into the highlands and then through to the Wastelands of Pesh, the Murians found a new pastime to occupy themselves: monster hunting. Expeditions are constantly making raids into the region with each caravan leader competing to ﬁnd the most dangerous and exotic creature. These creatures usually meet their ends in the ﬁghting pits and arena of Mur while others are shipped around Oerik as far away as Risayn, Ekbir, Eta and even Tianshi Forms of government and rulership vary from city-state to city-state with oligarchy being the most common form.  In these states the elite, be they warriors or the wealthy dominate and control state policy. Others have despots (or despotrixes), some benevolent, some anything but. One of their most ancient city-states, Coreth, is a democracy, having overthrown the  Despotrix Halegtha and her demonic Minotaur servants over two hundred years ago. Murians spend most of their time outdoors. This allows the Murians to develop themselves physically, through regular exercise, and mentally and politically from their ability to meet together in large numbers and spend time outside the conﬁnes of their own houses. Children are taught to read and write at an early age and study in local schools under a tutor until they are 14 years old at which time they are Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 166 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. schooled in the ﬁghting arts.  At 21 they are considered adults and ready to serve their city-state in the military. While many continue on with military  pursuits after their mandatory service, others instead focus their attentions on trade, exploration or matters arcane. Murians worship twelve gods who they believe walk among them (in disguise of course). Known as the True Gods, they have no formal priesthood with each individual Murian communing with whatever deity’s portfolio  governs their current need or predicament. Rare individual’s are born who have a more personal relationship with one the gods, claiming to be able to see and hear the True Gods, some even claiming carnal knowledge of one of the divine!  Since these “Chosen” obviously display powers, most Murians show them great respect. The warrior is a central part of Murian culture. At least half of Murian men (and many women) spend their days in military training and service to their city-state. While combat is not the only way to glory for a Murian, it is perhaps the easiest. It does not require special study, inborn talents, or even a heavy investment for equipment. While most serve in the militaries of their home city-state, some instead become a member of a warrior society. These quasi- military groups organize warriors under a strict set of laws. Members live communally and these fortresses are carefully laid out camps with barracks and defences. Due to the warm climate, heavy armor is impractical. Linen and leather armors are most common with the breastplate or scale typically being the heaviest armor worn. Chainmail and its padding are unknown. Murian warriors are usually armed with spears, short swords and large round shield.  They are trained in mass combat tactics involving the interlocking use of shields. Murians are fair-skinned but because of their climate most are near-permanently tanned. Murian men take care to keep their beards \short and neat and most clip their hair short as soon as they are accorded the status of being men, so as to give enemy soldiers anything to hold on to. Women who don’t ﬁght wear their hair long. Several styles exist and all depend upon tying the hair up off the neck with ribbons.  Both men and women’s hair is regularly treated with scented oil. By ancient custom Murian women who follow martial paths typically shave their heads and darken their eyes with kohl. Though dark hair predominates, white-haired and blonde Murians are not unknown and auburn hair is thought to be very beautiful and desirable.

You gain proﬁciency with Nature and Survival. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you.

Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you ﬁnish a long rest. Oeridians Oeridian skin tones range from tan to olive; brown and auburn hair are common, though some individuals have hair as light as honey or as dark as coal. Likewise, eye coloration is highly variable; brown and gray are seen most often. Oeridians tend to have square or oval faces and strong jaw lines. After inhabiting what is now Ull and the Paynim Plains for generations, barbaric Oeridians were pressed on all sides by enemies during the later stages of Baklunish-Suel Wars.  Pressed into the military service by both nations for decades they were ﬁnally driven east by orcs and goblins employed as mercenaries by the Baklunish and Suel. Led by Johydee of the Aerdi and Arnd of the Tdon, the Oeridians began a mass migration through the Fals Gap and into the Flanaess negotiating passage with the native Flan tribes where possible and, when diplomacy failed, battling their way forward, driving the Suel before them and allying with the Flan, elves, dwarves, and other peoples where they could. Nearly pure Oeridians are today seen in lowland Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 168 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Perrenland, Keoland, Furyondy, the Great Kingdom, Sunndi, and Onnwal. The Oeridians are generally a very ambitious folk. Their devotion to power and greatness also gives them an admirable streak of discipline. Say what you will about their conceit or greed, such characteristics are what drove them to design great castles, conquer much of the Flanaess and revolutionize warfare. The Oeridian peoples rose from an extended time of enslavement to the pre-eminent position on Eastern Oerik. As a people, the Oeridians were more of a military state from their earliest times. The migrating Oeridians passed over the Flanaess like a brushﬁre, reaching the Solnor ocean in under two centuries. Ousting the Suel and Flan  leaders they found, and largely replacing the powerful territorial magnates, the Oeridians imposed a new political structure that is broadly termed “feudal”. Many of the Suel and Flan leaders lost lands and titles and a number of free peasants had their rights and legal access much decreased, becoming unfree villeins, despite the fact that this status did not exist among the Oeridians themselves. At the same time, many of the new Oerdian magnates were distributed lands by the Grand Duke, and then later the King, that had been taken from Suel nobles and the Flan. Although initially nomadic and tribal... their movement to a cosmopolitan monarchical system was rapid (beginning with individuals like Lum and Tuerny). Their feudalistic system is strongly hierarchical by nature. However, there is great ﬂexibility in how a particular hierarchy is established and carried out. At the height of its power, the Kingdom of Aerdy spanned most of the Flanaess (with the exception of the southwestern Oeridian/Suel Kingdom of Keoland). The most powerful empire in the modern Flanaess was created by a conquering tribe of Oeridians, the Aerdi, who subjugated and assimilated all who opposed them. Ancient Oeridians were ﬁerce warriors, yet they also were self- sacriﬁcing and loyal. These traits are not as evident today, but many Oeridians do remain temperamental and prone to violence. They have a preference for strict social order, usually ﬁtting themselves at the top, and their military traditions are strong. Aggression is often channelled into political conﬂict and subterfuge. The Oeridian skill at warfare is unsurpassed, and many folk have a hard-learned respect for it. In peacetime, they are practical, hard working, and not inclined to intellectual pursuits. Chapter Two: Playable Races 169 Oeridian dress normally consists of a short tunic and close-ﬁtting trousers with a cape or cloak, tailored for ease of movement. Aerdi and Nyrondal Oeridians favour plaids and checks, with ovals or diamonds in the south and west. Colours and patterns once showed clan allegiance, but this practice is fading in favour of personal colour preference. Oerdian men usually shave their faces and keep their hair cut very short, unlike the Flan and Suel, who generally prefer beards, moustaches, and/or long hair. Oerdian women also wear their hair short in many cases. The famous Oerdian haircut consists of a small swatch of hair on top of the head to the ears, while the back of the skull is closely shaven. This haircut probably developed due to their tendency to wear chainmail coifs over their heads, which will tangle painfully with long hair. Oerdian culture revolves heavily around ﬁghting and combat. They have strong military values that permeates their culture. Their favourite pastimes including hunting and sparring. Following their warlike tendencies, magic-using Oeridians focus on battle-oriented spells, as well as the enchantment of magic items useful in combat. Spell-casters have a hard-nosed, practical attitude, and they are generally hawkish and outgoing. Many strive to be leaders or masters. Magic is often used for pragmatic purposes, too, such as construction, irrigation, and iron- forging. Oeridians have their own gods and goddesses but over the last 500 years powers from other races have also entered into common worship. Their pantheon today ix a hybrid one with Heironeous, Hextor, Pholtus, Zilchus and Oeridian Traits The widest spread human racial group of the Flanaess, Oeridians can be found from the Solnor  coast of The Great Kingdom to the Crystalmist and Yatil Mountains. They make up the majority of the nobility and aristocracy in most human nations with the exception of the Sheldomar Valley where Suel and Oerdian houses share power and Tenh which is a Flan nation.

You gain proﬁciency on Insight and Persuasion. Once per short rest you may grant an ally advantage on a single attack roll or saving throw so long as they can see and hear you. Olman The Olman have skin of a rich copper- brown. Their hair is always straight and black, and their almond-shaped eyes are dark, from medium brown to nearly black. Olman men tattoo their skin extensively, recording major events of their lives directly onto their skin. Some nobles still wear large nose and ear rings of jade or gold. This practice is considered archaic by most non-nobles. The Olman settled the Tilvanot Peninsula and the Amedio Jungle after having been driven out of their original homeland on Hepmonaland by the ancient Torhoon Empire. Originally, slaves of the reptilian Torhoon, the ancient Olman gained their freedom after a rebellion led by the hero- god Kulkatlan. Fleeing north away from the Torhoon they established a number of city states that prospered for several centuries before falling to some unknown plague or natural disaster. The Olman abandoned their cities and migrated again, en masse, across the Tilva Straight, ﬁrst establishing colonies on the Tilvanot and then island hopping to the Amedio across the Densac Gulf. Through centuries of warfare against both the native Yuan-ti and Tabaxi, they built an empire eventually covering nearly half of the Amedio, their namesake islands, the entire Tilvanot Peninsula and Chapter Two: Playable Races 171 even parts of the current land of the Sea Princes. Ultimately, these cities also fell to the curses of civil war and supernatural upheaval, until most Olman reverted to a more primitive way of life of hunting and gathering with some slash and burn farmers. Today all but one of their ancient cities lie in ruin and the Olman people are now spread out across the jungles of the Amedio, and their namesake Olman Isles. The three remaining Olman tribes on the Tilvanot Peninsula have been enslaved by the Suel but escapees have formed remote communities who still  wage a guerilla war against the hated Scarlet Brotherhood. The Olman Empire was a hybrid of monarchy and theocracy, with hereditary emperors and warlords ruling alongside clerics and astrologers. Modern Olman have a tribal culture, with a hereditary chief who is always a cleric leading each tribe. Each chief is dedicated to one of the Olman gods. These gods appear strange and alien to most outsiders. Chief among them is Kulkatlan the Liberator, the god of the freedom, the sky, birds and snakes who takes the form of a great feathered serpent. Other include the Huracan, god of storms, Tlatlan, god of rain, rivers and cenotes and Kakchik, goddess of the nocturnal sky, ancestral memory, and of time. Of special signiﬁcance is Zoztzl the bat-winged god of death. His cult is a vile one and his worshippers are feared and loathed by other Olman. His cult has many hideouts among the ruins of the ancient Olman cities where they bring capture to sacriﬁce to their hungry god. Most Olman today rarely travel much beyond the territory controlled by their home village.  Men of one village will raid neighboring villages for food, luxury goods and sometime slaves, who are very well treated, often marrying into a family of the villager who captured them. Women are responsible for small vegetable plots, child rearing and deal with diplomatic relations with neighboring villages.  The men hunt for meat and conduct war when required. The Olman don’t really have a scholarly magic tradition but sorcerers and warlocks are not unknown among them. Olman men are forbidden from the priesthood and since only priests may lead a village, Olman culture is most aplty described as matriarchal. While Olman clothing tends to be simple and monocolour, such as a split skirt, loincloth, or shawl- like upper garment, they have fantastic methods of decoration, using beads, stones, feathers, bones, metal, and wood. These items decorate their clothes, weapons, and especially ceremonial items such as elaborate headdresses. The Olman favour magic of illusion and subterfuge. They also choose divination spells that allow them to understand the world around them and perhaps comprehend the omens of their distant gods. They have two elite Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 172 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. orders of warriors who are highly regarded by all social classes the orders of the Eagle and that of the Jaguar.

Rhennee The complexion of Rhenn-folk ranges from olive to tan; their hair is usually curly and tends to be black or dark brown. Most have eyes of gray, blue, or hazel, but green is known in some families. The Rhennee are generally short but strong and wiry, with men averaging 5 ft. 6 in. and women less. The Rhennee are not native to Oerth; rather, they are accidental travellers from another plane or world, citizens of a lost homeland they call Rhop. Their legends say that they appeared ﬁrst in the Great Kingdom, in or near the Adri Forest. Pursued by monsters and hostile Aerdi, they ﬂed west to the shores of the Lake of Unknown Depths, where they took to life on the water. Little is known of the original culture of the Rhennee, as they were absent from the Flanaess prior to 450 years ago and entered their current lifestyle to escape persecution. They now expertly ply the great rivers that cross the Flanaess and migrate between the three great lakes (though Whyestil Lake is lately unsafe for travel). The Rhenn-folk are masters of inland sailing and navigation, and they love their nomadic and adventurous life. Most Rhennee live exclusively on the waterways. making their homes on large barges that average about 60 feet long and 15 feet wide. These sturdy barges are similar in style to the junks found in the Celestial Empire; they are capable of navigating the Nyr Dyv’s often choppy waters and treacherous storms, as well as riverways. These ships may have one or two mast. Chapter Two: Playable Races 173 Rhennee are silversmiths, coppersmiths, haberdashers, cooks, weavers, musicians, entertainers, storytellers, toolmakers, and sail makers. They also earn money by telling fortunes and selling information. They spend whatever they earn to support a lavish lifestyle, display their wealth openly as a sign of prosperity, and share their good fortune with family and friends. Each family or clan of Rhennee is its own little gerontocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder carries the bulk of the responsibility for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group’s travels, and preserving the Rhennee way of life. Rhennee elders make all the important decisions, but whether by choice or because of their age, tend to speak in cryptic, ﬂowing riddles. Rhennee families and clans are closely knit. They resolve disagreements through contests that end with reconciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling. The Rhennee are quick to act when their lives or traditions are threatened and are merciless when they believe they must be. Each bargewright is responsible for, and protects, the people on his barge. The Rhennee on each barge are more or less an extended family, although several barges together may often be an even larger “family” under the leadership of a elder traveling with the group.  A Rhennee barge has a variable number of people on board, depending on the size of the craft: 2-4 guards (all male), 13-24 ordinary folk (half males, half females), plus 7-12 children and a wise woman. Rhennee are fairly common on the waterways of the central Flanaess and near inland shores and banks where they rarely leave their boats. While the majority of Rhennee ply the waterways of the Flanaess, about twenty percent of Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 174 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. their number have begun migrating to a land-based lifestyle over the last few generations. Known as the Atloi, these Rhennee travel widely in small caravans of wagons, carts, and coaches, buying goods in one location and selling at great proﬁt in far off lands. Some Atloi groups have even been seen are far aﬁeld at Zeif. The Rhennee have deep-rooted beliefs and superstitions that they pass down from one generation to the next. Some Rhenee women are blessed with prescience. The wise woman is a symbol of the odd role of women in Rhennee society.  A wise women is usually between 35- 85 years old, which makes her a major source of advice and comfort to the superstitious Rhennee folk. Wise women have skill in herbalism and healing.  They can read tea leaves and perform similar actions, to predict the future (see the Second Sight ability q.v.). Wise women are the real power in Rhennee society, for even a Rhennee elder will not knowingly contradict their word. They do not use this power for leadership, however.  They suggest, insinuate, and use cryptic prophecy to inﬂuence their men, who they basically manipulate as they desire. Rhennee as a people are known for the curses, which are potent, but they are invoked with great caution. Rhennee know that to curse one who is undeserving of such punishment can have grave consequences for the one who utters such a curse. They have no known gods and thus no clerics among them. They revere ravens as spirits of the afterlife, so killing one is forbidden. While in towns, the Rhennee usually live on board their barges, conducting their business of trading and selling in nearby wharf areas.  They may visit taverns often, but usually stay in or near the harbour district.  A wise woman with a suitable entourage of handmaidens and male escorts also visits the city to tell fortunes and such for additional income. In addition to trade and transport, Rhennee make some little money from craftwork (sail making and repair, cloth making, etc) and ﬁshing. Rhennee are extremely loyal to each other so far as outsiders are concerned.

Any threat given, or harm inﬂicted, to a Rhennee by an outsider will arouse the wrath even of Rhennee who are hostile to the injured party, unless truly exceptional c i r c u m s t a n c e s prevail. On rare occasions, outsiders who perform some important service for the Rhennee, or who have valuable skills and gain an exceptional reaction Chapter Two: Playable Races 175 from them, may be treated as “honorary Rhennee” and given some token of this fact.  Future interaction with any Rhennee will be enhanced—how much depends on the nature of the service, the status of the Rhennee for whom the service was performed, etc. Rhennee can be commonly found in Dyvers,   Veluna, Furyondy, the County of Urnst, the Shield Lands, Perrenland and in the Wharf and River Quarters of the Free City of Greyhawk. Because of stereotypes and prejudice, due to their cultural differences, Rhennee tend to be insular and keep to themselves. Along with their annoyance at having to speak in any language but rhopan, they have many other social taboos that are perceived as virtually unbreakable that prohibit such things as marrying outside of their own culture, or teaching their language to non-Rhennee. Rhennee Traits Trusted as merchants but otherwise viewed as outsiders, the Rhenn-folk are masters of inland sailing and navigation, and they love their nomadic and adventurous life. Music and gambling are beloved amusements. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity and Charisma scores increase by 1. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Rhopan.

You gain proﬁciency in the History and Insight skills. Suhfeng The Suhfeng, or Suh, people have yellowish-bronze skin with black hair and broad, ﬂat features and almond-shaped eyes, typically of brown or hazel colour. Hair is an important feature for both sexes. It can show both age and status. Men of rank draw their hair back and ﬁx it in a topknot, holding it in place with carved pins or a cord. This is a privilege generally reserved only for nobles, warriors, and Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 176 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Chapter Two: Playable Races 177 those of the ruling class. The age of a person also effects the hairstyle. Small children are often shaved bald except for a single lock—on the crown for boys and over the ear for girls. As they grow older, this practice is stopped and the child grows a full head of hair. Young warriors tie this in the topknot described above. Peasant men normally wear their hair loose or tied back in a long queue. Women let their hair grow long and ﬂowing, possibly gathering it up into elaborate headdresses. The length and luxury of a woman’s hair is a measure of her beauty and her station. When the original human Su progenitor tribe split over 10,000 years ago the Su-el moved north out of the steppes and eventually evolved into the Murian civilization (and later the Suloise). The other half of the Su, the Su-feng migrated west over the great Tyurzi Mountains and through the unforgiving Taklan Pass, pursued and harassed by goblinoids. They eventually came to settle widely around the fertile plains of the Gulf of Shanji where they established many small petty kingdoms over the next several generations. They successfully drove the bakemono in front of them as they expanded ﬁrst north and then south until they had colonized the entire area now known as the Celestial Empire. The Suhfeng were friendly with the indigenous Yokai and Spirit Folk and these three peoples integrated into a new uniﬁed culture which would eventually also incorporate the Korobokkuru of the Minyeo region. By 2,000 years ago, the Suh culture had spread to cover nearly the entire western half of Oerik but these  peoples weres till fractured politically, broken into over a hundred kingdoms and an ever shifting balance of alliances and wars. This was the perfect chaotic environment; society was rife for interference by demonic outsiders. Tempting warlords with power and guile, more than one demon lord saw an opportunity to not only sow discord and chaos on the Prime Material but also a chance to possibly gain and wield power on Oerth. They set about corrupting Suh warlords who increasingly found beneﬁt in using demonic troops in the incessant wars between states.

Eventually, more and more powerful demons were summoned to Oerik and the Suh became enslaved to them rather than being their masters. Cities became centers of demonic worship and trade and agriculture fell off drastically. After several hundred years of demonic domination, a wandering band of olve, known as the Neuth, made their way into the region and discovered the dominance the lords of the Abyss had over the region. They helped organize willing Suh into a rebel force and began pushing back against the might of the demonic forces. Initially outnumbered by a thousand to one or more, the olve sought out a balancing factor to the evil outsiders and summoned many celestials to aid them against the hordes of demons. The Demon Wars consumed the region for over ﬁve centuries before the celestial empyrean, Jiao, son of the goddess Jascar, led Suhfeng, Olven and Celestial forces against  the last demonic state, and drove the evil forces into Pesh. The Suhfeng viewed the empyrean lord and the other celestials as the saviours of their people and declared Jiao emperor of all Suhfeng lands, pledging eternal loyalty and obedience to him. He reluctantly accepted the honour, fearful that should he return to the upper planes that one or more powerful ﬁends would take advantage and return to dominate the region once again. In cooperation with the Mist Dragons, Jiao erected the Demon Wall to keep the demons and their bakemono and oni allies out of the newly formed Celestial Empire. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 178 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. As Suhfeng culture once again ﬂourished and grew, the Suh people expanded south into Vulzhari Peninsula, west out into the islands of the Pearl Sea and east into the Tyurzi Mountains, Flame Desert and even out into the eastern Dry Steppes where they are amongst the best horsemen in the world. The great Celestial Empire is the largest of the many lands that make up Oerik. It is a place of learning, culture and government, with a proud history that chronicles nearly twenty ﬁve hundred years. With its extensive history and stable governance, the Empire exerts a mighty inﬂuence over its neighbours. Over the centuries, several Suhfeng factions have either sprung up outside the borders of the Empire, like Behow and Sa’han or have broken away from the Empire, as was the case in Minyeo and in the nascent Ryuujin Empire on the Kozan Isles. The Suh culture, being guided for so long by celestials is very focused on order and honour. They have great pride in their ancestors, their Emperor, and their own good names. These, they will defend with all their power, for to lose face is to lose everything. Of course, not all insults must be settled by blood; in fact, it is sometimes preferable to avoid bloodshed, as this will bring out the magistrate and his guard. Being condemned for murder is an even greater stain upon the family honour. A typical Suh prefers to give insult or avenge it in more indirect ways; by ruining a reputation; by bringing a great estate to bondage; by assassination, or by publicly beating his opponent senseless in the street with his superior martial arts. What is most important to the Suhfeng is the honour of the family clan, not himself. Insult a Suhfeng and you have merely angered him. Insult his parents and you have incurred the vengeance of his entire clan. Harm his children or siblings, and no force in the Celestial Heaven will save you from his wrath. Such is the power of family in this land. The center of the Suhfeng world is the clan. The clan is a tightly woven family, including grandparents, married children, grandchildren, servants and even beasts. At the top of the clan hierarchy is the Clan Head or Tai- tai in Suh, who is always the eldest Chapter Two: Playable Races 179 male of the family, although occasionally a grandfather will abdicate his leadership in ﬂavor of a young son (of 30 or 40) who has shown proper devotion and promise. The power of the Tai-tai is absolute. He may choose who is to marry, and to whom; where the-fortunes of the family are to be spent; and who is to inherit and when. To question his will is to risk being cast out of the clan. To a Suh, this is the ultimate fear, for without a clan, a man has no one to call upon for help, no honour to shield him, and no good name with which to win a living or a bride. Who will take care of him when he is old? Who will speak for him when his good name is slandered? It is well known that those who lose their clan will soon set out upon the road of brigandage and dishonour, for without the clan, what is there to live for? The Tai-tai is responsible to his family as well, he must provide food and shelter for them, and cause no dishonour to the family name. When business with merchants or the Celestial bureaucracy must be done, he must do it. If the bureaucracy chooses to punish a clan member, the Tai-tai, must shield the offender from the Emperor’s wrath, even taking the punishment himself. He must ﬁnd proper husbands and wives for his children, ﬁnd them worthy occupations and even support them if they are unable to ﬁnd work. A dutiful member of the clan must show respect in all ways to his Tai-tai. He will call him Honoured Father, Sir, or Master. When he goes abroad to make his fortune in the capital, he sends money back to the clan. The clan determines what work he will pursue, unless they have no speciﬁc directions. Even the choice of wife or husband must be approved by his Clan Head. But for this, the clan member has the security of knowing that, no matter where he goes, he will have people to stand for him, and the family honour and wealth to fall back upon. For all but the most adventurous, this is more than enough. In addition to those of the living, the clan encompasses the dead as well. Members of the clan who have achieved great things during their lives are remembered and honoured. Their deeds are often spoken of in the family histories, and sacriﬁces to their memories made every festival or feast day. Children are often given the names of a great clan member of the past, in hopes that the child will one day live up the honour of his ancestor. The Suhfeng practice mainly two forms of religion, the Path of Enlightenment and The Way. The majority of Suhfeng in the Celestial Empire practice the Path of Enlightenment, in which they worship the Celestial Emperor and a whole host of lesser immortals and spirits who make up what is called the Celestial Bureaucracy. The Way is primarily practiced in Behow, Wunan, Minyeo and on the islands of the Ryuujin Empire. A rare few Suhfeng worship demon cults, devils (mainly in the Ryuujin Empire) or foreign gods. The Suh people around the Shanji Gulf and south mostly eat rice and vegetables with meat rarely forming part of their diet. Those Suhfeng who live in the western side of the Empire tend to have more grains  and meat in their diets and vast herds of cattle, sheep and goats are tended to in the western marches of the Empire. Considered unappetizing to most residents of the Flanaess, Suhfeng also eat many varieties of insects. They consume wine and beer like in the east but they also have a drink called kumeen made from fermented rice. The most common materials used in making clothing are cotton and silk. Heavy leathers are used for durability, Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 180 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. while soft leathers like deerskin are used for items requiring ﬂexibility or lavish decoration. Primitive tribesmen and poor commoners use the cheapest and most available material for their clothing. White is typically the colour of mourning, so nearly all cloth is dyed. Common colours are browns, ochres, yellows, grays, and blues. The brighter colours of greens, pinks, and reds are rarer and are commonly worn by those of higher station. Dyes are made from ﬂowers, nuts, barks, wood, and certain minerals. The main articles of clothing vary depending on local climate. Most common is a set of short trousers, normally made of cotton. These wrap around the waist and tie with strings. They can be left loose at the bottom or tied to ﬁt snugly around the leg. The are normally loose- ﬁtting so that they can be pulled up for wading through rice paddies or streams. They are often dyed in stripes or other patterns. Such pants are typically worn by peasants of both sexes. Commoners normally wear a short robe over the trousers, tied with a belt. Wealthier and more important persons often omit the trousers, wearing one or more long robes instead. Among the nobility, wearing layers of robes is standard. Each layer is a different colour and peeks through at the ends of the sleeves and around the collar. Arranging the colour and order of the layers is an art for many of the ladies of a noble’s court. Robes have wide, open sleeves, both for artistic and practical effect. In cold weather, the sleeves serve as muffs, since gloves are not normally worn. They are also used as pockets where a handkerchief or string of cash can be kept safely tucked away. Robes are often lavishly decorated with dyes, brocade, and embroidery and may be quite valuable. During colder seasons, warmth is achieved by adding more and heavier layers of robes. An outer coat of quilted cotton is worn to protect from cold winds. As the day grows warmer, layers are removed to maintain comfort. In rain, peasants wear a simple raincoat made from layers of straw. The choice of footwear also depends on the land and the climate.

Suloise The Suloise, also known as the Suel people, have the lightest coloration of any known human race of the Flanaess. Their skin is fair, with an atypical proportion of albinos. Their eyes vary from pale blue and violet through deep blue and the occasional gray. Hair colour ranges in the strawberry blondes, yellows and platinums. Wavy or kinky hair is seen as often as straight hair.. The Suel tend to be lean, with narrow facial features. The Suloise are the descendants of those Su-el people who were driven out of their original homeland by invading goblinoids and oni that rampaged through Mur while the Demon Wars were being fought in the lands of the Celestial Empire. Battling their way through the harsh Red Desert of Komal and Risay, they re-emerged into the western steppes where they were met with violence by the native horse nomads. Not ﬁnding the steppes to their liking, they continued to migrate south and west until they came to the broad plains between the Sulhaut and Zahind Mountain ranges that would eventually bear their name. Some hundred years later a group of traveling olve, exploring the south central portion of Oerik discovered the nascent Suel villages and established diplomatic ties with their tribal elders. Over time, the olve began tutoring the humans in mathematics, language, art and, most importantly, magic. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 182 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. The Suel proved apt students and soon they were constructing great cities and delighted their olven friends both with their creativity and their productivity. The cities of the Suel were patterned similar to those of the elves set in  their mountain fastnesses, but these occupied the plains and river valleys of the southlands that came to be known as the Great Suel Basin which lies between the Crystalmists in the east, the Sulhauts in the north, the Tyurzi Mountains far to the west and the Zahind range in the south.  In this vast swathe of fertile territory the Suel Imperium grew to dominate all of her neighbours. The Suel Imperium was located in what is now the Sea of Dust. Wicked and decadent, this empire was destroyed during a war with the Baklunish when the latter brought down the Rain of Colourless Fire, Suloise survivors ﬂed in all directions, many crossing the Hellfurnaces into the Flanaess, where they met other Suel who had ﬂed the long war much earlier. Some evil Suloise were forced into the extreme corners of the Flanaess by invading Oeridians. The barbarians of the Thillonrian peninsula are pure Suel, as are the elite of the Scarlet Brotherhood. The people of the Duchy of Urnst and places in the Lordship of the Isles are nearly so. Many Suel made forays into the Amedio jungle and attempted to enslave the locals. Their struggles exhausted both peoples and today the Suloise of the Amedio live a primitive and barbaric lifestyle. The Suel Imperium was governed by contesting noble houses, and the ﬂeeing bands that entered the Flanaess were often led by nobles with their families and many retainers. The modern Suloise retain this afﬁnity for family, although they often use a very narrow deﬁnition of the word to include only siblings, parents, and children. A few Suel can trace their lineage all the way back to the days of their imperium. The ancient Suel Imperium was exceedingly cruel. This trait surfaces in the modern day, for more than one Suloise organization openly plots against other people of the Flanaess. Fortunately, most Suel have avoided this dark legacy, having inherited the relatively minor ﬂaws of being opinionated, selﬁsh, and blunt. Many also tend to be prideful and unwilling to admit ﬂaws or personal hardships. They have a passion for study, especially in regard to magic, and many Suel wizards become incredibly powerful. The Suloise have a strong sense of the importance of ancestral and family ties. They ﬁght more among themselves than other human groups because of these ancient allegiances. The Suloise are not known for their patience. They have a short way with disagreements, since they tend to be opinionated and convinced that their notions are the best. A popular saying in some parts of the Flanaess is, “when all the Suloise have left the table,” meaning that nothing constructive will take place in a discussion until anyone unwilling to be open-minded is removed. These folk are also known for their manual dexterity. They have a talent for all arts and crafts, especially those involving detail work such as embroidery, sewing, leather tooling, sculpting and painting. Suloise weavers can demand the highest prices on the continent for their fabrics, both for the ﬁne grain of their weaves and the extraordinary detail of their patterns. The Suel have a long tradition of wizardry and magical research, and the ancient Suel Imperium produced many powerful magics, culminating in the Invoked Devastation that laid waste to the ancient Baklunish Empire. Heirs of a highly magical society, the Suloise still have an aptitude for most types of spell-casting. Suel wizards often become masters of spells that involve transmutation. They Chapter Two: Playable Races 183 also perfected a number of planar binding spells and created many items used for controlling and dominating other beings. For instance, it is thought that a long- dead Suel emperor made the ancient and terrible Orbs of Dragonkind. While most modern Suloise spellcasters are wizards, there are a fair number of Suel sorcerers and The Silent Ones in Keoland is made up largely of sorcerers and is perhaps the best known Suel magical society still extant on the Flanaess. While most humans living on the Flanaess today worship a hybrid pantheon of gods with roots in Baklunish, Flan, Oerdian and Suel faiths, the modern Suloise are more inclined to restrict their worship to their own pantheon. It should be noted that they do worship Boccob, who they believe to be one of their native deities. Of course both the Flan and Oerid believe Boccob to originate with them and sages are divided on the issue of which culture is correct. Ancient Suloise wore wide-legged pantaloons and loose blouses. These styles are still popular but have been adapted for climate. In the north, these garments can be of fur or felted wool, worn with capes, furred boots and mittens. Those in the south sometimes wear a loose vest instead of a blouse, and fabrics are lightweight. Solid colours are preferred universally, with most folk having only one or two colours in their wardrobe. Suloise also like to wear emblems and souvenir trinkets on their clothing. These ornaments are considered important items of family heritage. They can be passed down through generations. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 184 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. While those with Suel blood can be found nearly anywhere on the Flanaess, the majority live in one of the following regions: Thillonrian Peninsula: Many savants consider the Snow, Ice and Frost Barbarians of the far northeast to be the purest-blooded of existing Suel. Their culture is greatly devolved from that of ancient Suel Imperium and is based on a combination of raiding and exploring (supported by the more peaceful arts of farming and ﬁshing). Most Thillonrian Suel are exceptionally short-tempered, and it is nit uncommon to ﬁnd berserkers among these people. The Suloise of this area have a strong exploratory streak, and are quite likely to go adventuring. They are the least likely of all Suel to be interested in spellcasting. Sunelan Suel: Some Suel settled in the island realms off the south coast of Oerik. Most have become assimilated into the general Sunelan culture but a few enclaves of pure Suel-blooded families exist on some of the remote islands of the region. Likewise, many Suel settled the islands of the southeast shores of the Flanaess, speciﬁcally in Lordship of the Isles. Like their brethren of the Thillonrian Peninsula, they are expert seamen. With their strong tradition of trading, they are better at negotiating than most Suel. Central Flanaess Suel: In the Suel- dominated Duchy of Urnst and in the Sheldomar Valley, the justly famous temper of the Suloise has civilized itself to become no more than a certain impatience in negotiations. Except for followers of the Scarlet Brotherhood, many Suel in this area have allowed their culture to mix with others, so that they may be more “generic” culturally, sharing more with their geographical neighbours than with their brethren. Suloise mages from this area are likely to have been formally schooled at the University in Greyhawk or elsewhere. Amedio Jungle and Hepmonaland: After the Suel-Baklunish wars of a thousand years ago, ﬂeeing Suel settled in the Amedio Jungle and Hepmonaland to the south of the Flanaess. They remain there, ignored and forgotten except for occasional slave raids from the Lordship of the Isles, the Sea Princes of the enigmatic Scarlet Brotherhood. Amedio and Hepmonaland Suel are heavily freckled and tanned. Their native culture is based on small tribal villages. Their culture is primitive by Flanaess standards and there are rumours that some tribes practice cannibalism. Suloise Traits The majority of Suel people have a reputation for being proud, opinionated, Chapter Two: Playable Races 185 selﬁsh, and blunt but only the elitist Scarlet Brotherhood truly maintain themselves as members of the old ways. In general, the Suel of the Thillonrian Peninsula are highly warlike while Suel descendants in lands such as the Scarlet Brotherhood, the Lordship of the Isles, the Sea Barons, the Sheldomar Valley, and the Urnst States tend to lean towards mental pursuits, especially magic, and Suel wizards often become very powerful.

Pure Bloodline: Your Suel blood is particularly pure and untainted, and you can make a direct genealogical link with the glorious past of the Suloise Imperium and their mighty sorcerers, as well as modern-day organizations that seek a return to those bygone days of Suel glory. Your Intelligence or Charisma increases by 1. You gain proﬁciency in Intimidate. In addition, you can cast the Detect Magic spell once using this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you ﬁnish a short or long rest. Vatun’s Touch: You have a connection with the great god Vatun that gives you an unnatural resistance to the cold. Your Constitution increases by 1. You are resistant to frost damage and receive no damage or exhaustion from travelling in cold climates. Sunelan The region now known as the Sunelan Coast was once part of the Suel Imperium. Conquered centuries before the fall of the Imperium, this tropical region of river valleys and jungles was originally home to a mahogony-skinned people who came to settle this coastal region from the massive archipelago that lines the southern coast of Oerik. These original Sunelans were enslaved by the invading Suel and they made up the backbone of the plantation economics of the region for centuries. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 186 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. The ancient city of Sunela had long been the “Southern Capitol” of the Suloise Imperium, as well as a vital part of its economy. When the colourless rain began to fall, the Empress and her three youngest children were in residence at the Grand Palace of Shatura, hosting a party celebrating their “victory” over the Bakluni. With this, the Suel Imperium was all but wiped from the map but it’s destruction did not reach all the way to the Sunelan Coast.  The cities and towns here survived the physical destruction but the social and economic upheaval was cataclysmic. An “Emperor in Exile” attempted to maintain control of the region for a generation but eventually the long- suffering native population ﬁnally rose up against their Suel masters and overthrew them in a  violent revolution.  Those Suloise who attempted to resist were wiped out.  Others chose to compromise with their former slaves and over time, eventually intermarried with them.  Over centuries a new culture arose, Suloise at its core but also incorporating Islander  (q.v.) culture and traditions as well.  Today the two ethnic groups are thoroughly mingled and the result is the brown-skinned, blue-eyed Sunelans. This group is most prevalent in the coastal and inland cities where they form the majority of the population. On the islands, the people tend to have the darker, mahogany-hued skin tones and hazel or brown eyes.  Traditional Sunelan clothing includes long, loose skirts/kilts with both men and woman going topless. Today this style is most frequently found among the Islanders while the Coastlanders tend to favour the traditional Suel loose blouses and pantaloons.  Reds and blacks are very popular as colours and the colour blue is reserved for the rulers. Many of the jungles of the region were long ago cleared for plantations.  While may of these were razed during the Islander Uprising, there are still many producing bananas, mangos, papaya,

sugar and greyweed (a popular, intoxicating pipeweed). In the foothills of the Ladhur and Ongial mountain ranges tea, sweet potatoes and avocados are grown for both domestic consumption and export to the Zahind lands to the west. Many exotic woods are also harvested in both the coastal areas and on the islands.  Seafood is the dominant form of meat eaten by the Sunelans including shellﬁsh, molluscs, ﬁsh, shark, seals and even whales. The only land-based animal usually eaten are p i g s and jungle fowl. Chapter Two: Playable Races 187 Contrary to the focus on politics and control of land of the Suel Imperium, in modern Sunelan ideology, one does not “own” the land, but merely dwells on it. The belief is that both the land and the gods are immortal. This then informs their belief that land is also godly, and therefore above mortal and ungodly humans, and humans therefore could not own land. The Sunelans believe that all land belongs to the gods whom they call A’kua. Chiefs, known as Ka’hoon, are viewed as stewards of the land and are always clerics. Beneath them are the A’li, the Sunelan word for “manager”. These are essentially the equivalent to a noble on the Flanaess.  On the death of one kahoon and the ascension of another, lands are re-apportioned—some of the previous a’li would lose their lands, and others would gain them. Lands are also re-apportioned when one kahoon defeats another and re-distributes the conquered lands as rewards to his warriors. In practice, commoners have some security against capricious re-possession of their houses and farms. They are usually left in place, to pay tribute and supply labor to a new kahoon, under the supervision of a new konohiki, or overseer. This system of land tenure is not dissimilar to the feudal system found in places like Keoland and Furyondy. The Sunelan mystical world-view allows for different gods and spirits to imbue any aspect of the natural world. From this mystical perspective, in addition to his presence in lightning and rainbows, the God of Light and Life, Kanu, can be present in rain and clouds and a peaceful breeze. Major a’kua also include Ku and Ko, twin gods of war, Ke-loa, goddess of death, Pel, goddess of ﬁre and Hiala, god of storytelling and dance. Sunelans have acquired a reputation as great navigators—their dual-hulled outrigger canoes are arguably the most seaworthy vessels on Oerth and Sunelans have colonized well over a hundred islands in the thousand mile long Sunelan Archipelago chain.  They accomplished this voyaging using ancient navigation skills of reading stars, currents, clouds and bird movements—skills passed to successive generations down to the present day. Today nearly all Sunelans’ lives are tied to the sea.  Those who aren’t toiling the land as farmers are invariably Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 188 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. seagoing merchants or pirates.  In fact, the Sunelans are the most frequently seen traders along the entire southern coast of Oerik from the last Olman city of Xamaclan in the Amedio to Chomur in the east. Within the last generation, Sunelan navigators have discovered Hepmonaland and begun trading with the Touv. Due to the prevailing southwest winds, the Sunelans have yet to make their way to the Flanaess and they are a complete unknown in that region. Sunelan Traits Sunelans are a mixture of Suel and the indigenous island Zin people. They are among the most skilled seafarers in all of Oerth. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution and Wisdom and scores increase by 1. Languages. You an speak, read, and write Sunelan and either Jebli, Olman, Zahind or Zundal. Child of the Sea. You have a swim speed of 25 feet.

You are proficient with Navigator’s Tools but do not need physical tools to make a skill roll. Ka’ala. The Sunelans are renowned as powerful warriors and sea raiders. They have their own style of combat and have developed a unique tradition known as Ka-ala that involves using gesticulations and facial expressions to unsettle and intimidate foes. You have proficiency in Intimidation. As a bonus action you may force an opponent to make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 10 + your Intimidation skill rating.

You may regain one used spell slot of a level equal or less than one quarter your level as a bonus action (minimum 1). You may not do so again until you ﬁnish a long rest. Touv The Touv people have dark brown to ebony skin. They universally have blue eyes, from pale powder blue to deep navy, and straight or wavy hair. Those from the central and more northern regions of Hepmonaland have rounded facial features and are average human height. Those from the southern savannah and deserts are typically taller and leaner than most people of the Flanaess, with the tallest Touv reaching about 6’8” in height. While most Touv males do not have facial hair, certain subgroups can grow narrow beards on their chins. The Touv people prefer their heads bare, although men and women tie up their hair with metal or wooden pins or braid it into a thick tail. A loose vest-like shirt protects them from the sun, and short leggings or a loose skirt covers the lower half of the body. They decorate their clothing with bright needlework, and their shoes are made of stiff leather painted with geometric designs. They wear jewellery in their ears, and around their arms and wrists.

They speak Zundal a complex language that is a polyglot of tribal tongues containing many words that mean the same thing. This and the unusual clock-like sounds used make Zundal difﬁcult for outsiders to learn. By two and a half thousand years ago, tribes of Touv wandered the savannah and lower jungles of Hepmonaland, farming small plots and chasing herds of wild cattle. Over the centuries, they collected into larger groups and formed permanent settlements. Though there were a few ﬁghts over land and cattle, the majority of the Touv worked amiably with their distant cousins. Around 800 years ago, a charismatic tribal leader of great magical ability named Onatal convinced three of the larger tribes to combine into one, and the agglomerate tribe took great leaps in metallurgy, farming and herding. The remaining tribes quickly joined the large one and Onatal proclaimed herself Umam of the Cities, umam being the Kundal word for queen. The nation of Great Kundali was born. The Touv had always had a matriarchal society and this was codiﬁed in the early laws of Great Kundali. The ruler of the nation is still a direct matrilineal descendant of Onatal and the position of court genealogist is one of the most respected among the Touv. In all other areas of society, men and women are considered equal.  One can ﬁnd equal numbers of male and female Touv in government, the military, agriculture, trade and even in familial roles like childrearing. The one exception to this is in the area of religion. The Touv have a unique approach to priesthoods whereby a priests/priestesses gender must match that of its patron deity.  That is to say that male Touv gods have male priests while goddesses have female clerics. (Touv culture traditionally has only two genders) Chapter Two: Playable Races 191 As Great Kundali grew, the Touv began to settle a larger and larger area, eventually coming into contact with the decadent Torhoon of the northern jungles. Repulsed by the reptlians—the primary evil god among the Touv is Meyanok, a serpent- deity —the Touv declared war upon the eveil reptile-folk. The unfamiliarity of the Touv warriors with the deep jungles hindered their war efforts at ﬁrst, but in time they learned the ways of the jungle, and their advanced metalworking skills, especially the use of  steel, gave them a serious advantage over the Torhoon. Unbeknownst to the Touv, their assault had forced a two-front war upon the reptilians as they had been battling the Olman city-staes in the north of Hepmonaland for over a generation. While the Torhoon appeared successful against the Olman, this weakened them and the Touv had little trouble sacking their remaining cities, usually driving the survivors into the wilderness. After fortifying its new northern borders, the Kundali returned to their previous existence of learning, herding and building. In 398 CY agents of the Touv snake- god corrupted the umwam of one of the cities and caused her to break from Great Kundali. Barely checked resentment burst forth in two other Touv city-states, and they also seceded. Today, the Empire of Great Kundali still covers much of western and southern Hepmonaland though there are four additional kingdoms, mainly along the fringes of the northern jungles as well as many  nomadic tribal nations in the savannahs of the south and slash and burn agriculturists in the jungles and rainforests. The vast majority of Touv live inland and along the eastern coast of Hepmonaland. Great Kundali ﬁelds a strong and well- trained military including exotic units like their rhino-riding heavy cavalry and their quick assault axe-beak cavalry. This strength has provided the Touv with a high level if stability for many generations. This stability has allowed the ﬂourishing of magical research and experimentation and Touv wizards are among the most accomplished transmutation wizards on Oerth and their more primitive tribal witch doctors are renowned masters of curses and hexes. The College of Azandes in Great Kundali has a library that would be the envy of any college of wizardry on the Flanaess. Touv worship many gods, it seems that every mountain, watering hole or glade of trees has its own speciﬁc diety. Clerics of Touv gods are known as Bakor while those of their goddesses are called Bakora. Their primary deities include the aforementioned Meyanok, god of death; Breeka, goddess of life;  Katay, god of the time; Berna, goddess of passion; Xanag, god of steel making and Lodot, god of the magic and the unknown, who is widely worshipped by Touv spellcasters and explorers. For most of its history, Touv culture and society developed largely without inﬂuence from other sentient species. The only non- humans with which they are familiar are generally hated enemies: the troglodytes, lizardfolk and dragonborn of the jungles, gnolls on the savannah and sahuagin who raid coastal settlements. They are aware of, but have little to no interactions with the leonin tabaxi who inhabit the far southern portion of Hepmonaland. They also trade, although only rarely, with the enigmatic Bwan, or wild dwur. A generation ago, along the west coast, a group of brown-skinned peoples arrived in massive outrigger canoes.  This coast of Hepmonaland is home to several small Touv independent communities and many more primitive tribal peoples.  The Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 192 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Sunelan explorers quickly established trade treaties with the majority of these people and now have a robust trade network with them trading foodstuffs and luxury items from the Sunelan Coast in exchange for ivory, jade, fur and exotic spices and wildlife from the Hepmonaland interior. In 571CY, the renowned Touv explorer and adventurer, Zakn Boku, took to the skies in the latest experimental invention of the Azandes School of Technomancy: the airship. Difﬁcult to control in high winds, Boku managed to successfully navigate two if his three airsips north of Hepmonaland where they made landfall in Lordship of Isles.

Zahind The Zahind are a human people descended for the progenitor Zin tribe that ﬂed Old Zarum thousands of years ago. They are related to the Sunelans and Touv and possibly the Baklunish and they inhabit an eponymous region that covers a large section of the southern-central region of Oerik. They live between the Zahind and Tyurzi mountains to the north and the Vogun Sea to the south.  They are a dusky-skinned people with a coppery hue. Their hair is usually ﬁne and straight and is typically black although auburn is not uncommon. Eye colour is dark with rare individuals having yellow eyes with cat- like pupils, marking them as being “beast- blooded” meaning they have Yokai blood in their genealogy. Men wear elaborate beards that could be the envy of any Flanaess dwur. It is the custom of the Zahind of Changol to never cut their hair from the age of fourteen. This custom  affects both men and women with the men wearing their long hair tied up and bound in elaborate turbans. Elsewhere both male and female Zahind wear their hair at shoulder length in most cases. Chapter Two: Playable Races 193 Zahind society is highly structured and hierarchical based on well-deﬁned castes. At the top is the Raj or sovereign who stands outside, and above the caste system. Below the sovereign is the Bramnas caste which is composed of priests and other religious functionaries. This caste has several subdivisions within it and along with their religious functions, the bramnas are also charged with administering justice and act as magistrates in Zahind lands. The Bramnas caste is forbidden to hold any poltical power but they are highly inﬂuential as advisors to the various nations of the region. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 194 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Below the clerics is the Satra caste of warrior. There are two subdivisions within this caste; the senior one is exclusively comprised of Dragonborn elite warriors and the subordinate one for soldiers of all other races.  The Vanas caste is made up of the mercantile class while the Sudas caste consists of nearly all the rest of the professions required to maintain an orderly civilization. This includes farmers, craftsmen, sailors, government functionaries,  etc. Below these are the Pani, or The Invisible. This is a unique position in that they are a criminal class of thieves. Considered a required part of the the Cosmic Wheel (see DM;s Guide to Oerik), members  of the caste are ignored by all other castes.  They can be apprehended (or more likely killed) in the conduct of their trade but should they succeed in a theft, they are never pursued or punished for their crimes but nor can they avail themselves of the services of normal Zahindi society.  Even farmers are forbidden from selling them food. Finally there are the Matawalli, or outsiders. These are all those outside the caste system including non-humans and foreigners.  This group technically has no legal rights in Zahind lands and visitors to the region should take note that “matawalli” also translates to “enslavable” in the Zahind language. In practice, foreign visitors and diplomats are geenrally well treated. It is said that the Zahind have over a thousand different gods.  Their pantheon is vast but hierarchical like Zahind culture. At its top is a sort of King of the Gods, the tiger god, Rajanash. Below him is his enforcer the dragon god, Safeer. Finally, there is Ganara, the elephant god and advisor to the King. These three make up the ruling triumvirate. Beneath them in a complex web of domains and inﬂuences with literally dozens and dozens of lesser deities and demi-gods not to mention hero- gods and other immortals. Some of the more popular are Sinda, the avenger god of war, Ganapati, the monkey-god of mischief and riddles, Sivatna, the shark god of the rain and the sea, and many others. It should be noted that a great many of the Zahindian deities have animal aspects, a trait scholars believe trace theor oirigns back to the Zarumite Empire. The Zahind are a very religious people and they practice many different rituals to honour their gods each day. Mediation is a common technique taught to all Zahind children to help them calm their minds and concentrate. Many also learn a complex form of exercises and contortion-like poses call Yun that is said to aid in meditation Chapter Two: Playable Races 195 and perfect the soul for its journey along the Cosmic Wheel. Zahind Traits The most populous species in their multi- racial, cosmopolitan homeland, Zahind are generally content with their place in society as a necessity for the advancement of the Cosmic Wheel. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence and Dexterity scores increase by 1. Languages. You an speak, read, and write Zahind and either Suh or Ancient Baklunish Meditative. Zahinds culture blends much superstition with religion. You may use your reaction to give yourself advantage on a concentration check. Birthright. You gain one of the following bonus racial feats: Yunic Disciple: You are a disciple of one of the schools that teach Yun. You are very ﬂexible and your Dexterity is increased by 1. In addition, you have advantage on rolls when attempting to avoid or break a grapple. Cosmopolitan: The Zahind lands are a crossroads of Oerik connecting the Sunelan Coast with the Suhfeng lands to the west and the Baklunish lands to the north. As a result most Zahind are exposed to a variety of other races and cultures on a daily basis.  Your Charisma increases by 1. You also gain proﬁciency in one of the following languages of your choice: Suh, Baklunish, Sunelan, Jebli, Loxodon or Draconic. In addition you gain proﬁciency in one of either Deception or Persuasion. Pani: You are a member of the Zahindi criminal caste. Your Wisdom or Intelligence is increased by 1. You gain proﬁciency in either Deception or Stealth.  When in Zahind-dominated lands, you gain advantage on all Stealth rolls. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 196 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Kenku Although humanoid, Kenkus clearly come from avian stock and retain many features common to birds. Kenkus average 5 feet in height, but because of their partially hollow bones, commonly weigh a mere 75 pounds. Their heads are the most distinctive part of their bodies—resembling those of oversized ravens or crows—complete with large, inquisitive black eyes and short beaks. Lacking wings, Kenkus possess scrawny arms that end in powerful claws and legs supported by taloned feet. (As a result, kenkus are unable to don normal shoes or other footwear, magical or otherwise, unless such items were created to ﬁt taloned wearers. Born from large eggs, young Kenkus naturally have soft, dark feathers, typically a shiny black in colour, which cover their heads and torsos, although variations do occur in certain individuals. Kenku are not native to the Flanaess however, one aerie is known to have migrated across Oerik to settle in the Yatils. These Kenku arrived on the Flanaess as they followed trading caravans into the Baklunish lands from their home, thought by many sages to exist somewhere far to the west;  some believe Risay while others think further west still; as far as the islands of the Ryuujin Empire. Regardless of their origin, they are well established, if not numerous, in and around Perrenland where they are often seen as a nuisance due to their night time thieving raids into Perrenlander towns. Kenku characters can be played as described in Volo’s Guide to Monsters Kenku suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or

monstrous a p p e a r a n c e when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Chapter Two: Playable Races 197 Loxodon The great lumbering Loxodon’s look like humanoid elephants.  They are the creation of long-forgotten Suel magics that brought into existence the various “beast lord’ races hundreds of years before the Twin Cataclysms. Loxodon hold a privileged position in the Zahindi structured social caste system where they serve as the priestly caste but are also sought out by various Rajs as scholarly advisors and engineers. As a result of their societal position, most Loxodon are clerics or wizards. Loxodon are viewed as semi-divine by the peoples of Zahind and attacking or otherwise harming one usually comes with a severe p=criminal penalty, including up to execution. They tend to be haughty and arrogant but there are also some who are very empathetic and caring as well, it s just the former outnumber the latter by a signiﬁcant amount. Loxodon characters can be played as described in Guildmaster’s Guide to Ravnica with the above lore changes in mind. Loxodon suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 198 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Noniz (Gnomes) All gnomes (noniz in Flan), regardless of sub race, are solidly built and muscular despite their height. (Most gnomes stand just over 3 feet tall.) Three major groups of them exist: rock gnomes, what most simply refer to as “gnomes”, are tan- skinned and blue-eyed, and almost all adults have light hair with a tendency toward male baldness; deep gnomes are hairless and wiry in physique, with gray or gray-brown skin; forest gnomes, look like rock gnomes but typically have green eyes and brownish hair. Males are most often bearded, though not so much as their dwarven cousins. Their facial features are a bit exaggerated compared to human norms, with prominent noses and eyebrows and leathery skin. Gnome society tends to be one of contrasts; their earthy humour and wisdom contrasts their ﬁerce protection of themselves and their culture, their talents for illusion magic contrast their talents for “technology”, their strong clan rivalries contrast their general cohesiveness in times of need (for the most part), their love of the treasures of the oerth and mining contrasts their love for the great outdoors and the treasures of nature. Long known as being full of humour and pranks, sometimes on the dark side of humour, gnomes are indeed full of mirth and earthy wisdom, their deities representing such. These pranks often come through in harmless ways during festival-days and the ﬁrst of every month, known as Garl’s Day for the pranking that goes on. On the other hand, they can become strong and militaristic when necessary (such as during the Hateful Wars, or against the hordes of Elemental Evil, and the gnomes of the eastern Flinty Hills, for instance). Some gnomes can react very strongly to perceived paternalism from humans or dwarves, as these two races tend to have a superior view of themselves. Gnomes are divided into clans much like the dwarves, but unlike the dwarves, where each large clan tends to have its own kingdom, many gnomish clans are organized into confederacies that band together under councils of elders and/or kings and queens. The rivalries between gnomish clans are strong as concerns matters of gem trade or political prestige, but such things rarely come to blows, as they do with the dwarves, for instance. A basic friendliness exists, while Flanaess dwarves sadly tend to let their desire for power and/or wealth get in the way of racial unity. Chapter Two: Playable Races 199 As far as matters of magic and “technology” go, it must be said that these are the same thing among gnomes. Garl Glittergold’s love for trickery has enticed many gnomes to follow the path of the illusionist rather than the other types of wizard long ago, and their “technology” is also supported and promoted by Flandal Steelskin. Gnomes are natural artiﬁcers and make up about eighty percent of the known practitioners of this rare branch of magic on the Flanaess. Gnomes tend to use complicated machinery such as sophisticated rock drills in mining, water puriﬁcation systems with dikes and pressure, highly elaborate traps and locks on treasure chests and cell doors, mechanics in toys, music boxes, clocks, and other little bits and pieces that can run on gears and leverage principles. The gnomish skill at technology is unrivalled, and indeed much of their racial magic is involved in it. Other races—and this includes humans in particular-—simply cannot use technology in the way gnomes do. Every attempt to replicate gnomish technology with any vestige of success has failed miserably. Gnomes love both the gems and precious metals of the oerth, and the beauty of the outdoors. Rock gnomes are the ones who have the tendency to live more in hilly, mountainous regions, while forest gnomes are the ones who choose to live in more forested regions, although this type is much rarer. The presence of both industrial deities like Flandal Steelskin and natural deities like Baervan Wildwanderer are yet another contrast in gnomish society. Finally, there are the exacting roles of men and women in gnomish society. Men are responsible for trade, war, and interaction with outsiders. Women are responsible for organizing social events, the general intra- clan life, food, and other such niceties that maintain the general social and cultural life within the clan. In individual clans, clan elders of men, headed by one chief, are ostensibly responsible for government, Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 200 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. but they cannot act without the support of the women, who are continually called on to give their opinions on matters dealing with the health and welfare of the clan. Women also select the men who will represent their clan at meetings of all the gnomish clans before speaking to the king of that region. Gnomes usually live in wooden stockades within hills, that are constructed on top of tunnel warrens that lead into mines and such. Stone forts can also be built in more violent areas, or areas where the supply of wood is not sufﬁcient for building. Gnomes both garden, hunt, and trade for food, gathering water from nearby rivers, glaciers, and underground streams. While dwarves purify this water with magic, gnomes use their pumping and ﬁltration systems to do so. As concerns relationships with other races, gnomes get along best with halﬂings, who often share their sense of humour, down-to-oerth approach, and general affability. Humans and dwarves often form deep friendship with their gnomish neighbours (such as in Verbobonc, the Yatils, and Ratik) but elsewhere (such as in the Lortmil Mountains) rivalries are strong, and gnomes tend to resent the paternalistic attitude they feel they receive from both races. As for elves, gnomes tend to keep separate from their elven neighbours, though there is no animosity. The noniz have had a less turmoil- ridden history than the elves or the dwarves, and perhaps they perceive this as a good thing. After gnomes spread from the tundra and wooded highlands of the far north, where they dominated, the ﬁrst great gnomish kingdoms were established in the Lortmils, Verbobonc and the Kron Hills, and the Flinty Hills, as in other regions dwarves tended to dominate. In most of these places, gnomes got along generally well with their neighbours, Chapter Two: Playable Races 201 although during the Great Migrations, there was a notable split between the western Flinty Hills gnomes and their eastern brethren. The eastern gnomes were ﬁercely independent, not wanting to deal with the Nyrondese men who were coming into the Flanaess. When their western kin were slaughtered at the Battle of a Fornight’s Length and forced to accept Aerdy rule along with the men of Nyrond, they felt it only conﬁrmed their attitude. Gnomish lairds and chiefs would recognize other races, but those of the eastern Flinty Hills remained stubbornly independent. Since then, gnomish history has been tied to many of the other races. They would often assist the people of their territories in chasing Aerdy rule from their lands, or in dealing with other aspects of evil, such as the Horde of Elemental Evil, Iuz, barbarian raiders from the north, or what have you. Political conﬂict came about between gnomes a few times, such as during the ﬁrst part of the Age of Great Sorrow (when gnomes ﬁrst debated seceding from the kingdom, and great arguments erupted because of that), the imperial phase of Keoland (when imperialist gnomes again wanted to support their Keoish neighbours, while isolationists did not), the attempt to rectify the damage done to the Flinty Hills community through a peace process, and ﬁnally during the Hateful Wars, when gnome and dwarf often turned on each other with unfortunate results. This last example was the most damning of all to the gnomes of the Lortmils, who to this day are enemies of some dwarven clans in the region. Sub-races Rock gnomes live more in hilly, mountainous regions, while forest gnomes live exclusively in forested regions, although this type is very rare on the Flanaess. Deep Gnomes of course are only suited as PCs for Underoerth campaigns as they are nearly unknown on the surface world. Rock Gnome Traits Rock Gnomes of the Flanaess receive the normal traits as per the PHB however they also receive these additional beneﬁts: Gnomish Combat Training: You have proﬁciency with the warpick and warhammer. Regional Noniz Populations The Mounds of Dawn/the Sepia Uplands: The gnomes here are militaristic, although friendly to outsiders who prove themselves. Being near to the evil of the Horned Society and/or Iuz, they have been forced to develop into a society of strong warriors. They are not part of the grand alliance of good in the Furyondy Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 202 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. region, preferring their solitude, and to stay with their allies in Perrenland, who currently are distrusted by the Velunese and Furyonds for their “neutral” stance towards the evil in the north. The Lorridges: In keeping with the region, the kindly, affable folk of the Lorridges are again some of the most open and friendly of their kind, which extends to those in the eastern Yatils. Only half-orcs arouse their ire, and any other race, particularly those of Velunese or Furyond origin, are well treated. The Kron Hills: Everyone knows of the secession these gnomes have made from Verbobonc proper. As a result of their terrible treatment, they are not inclined to view humans with anything other than suspicion, and are likely to turn a cold shoulder to requests for aid. Neither do they trust Greyhawk, and even less the people of the Wild Coast. Even outsider gnomes are now suspected as being in league with Verbobonc. They get on well with dwarves and elves, but prefer to keep themselves to themselves. The Lortmils: The gnomes here are unfriendly to all dwarves except those from the clans they recognize as friends, friendly to halﬂings and other gnomes, and neutral to humans and elves. The social problems here have yet to mend, and so they too prefer to keep to themselves. Geoff and Sterich: Gnomes live in the hills in the western regions of these nations. Geoff’s encouragement of friendship and harmony for all races has made the gnomes there as good and gentle as any towards other goodly races, although ﬁerce ﬁghters against the giants that can and do come down from the west. Sterich’s more dour and grim character means its gnomes have the same attitude, but they are by no means unfriendly. The ﬁghting among the humans in Sterich has made many of the gnomes even more cynical. The Cairn Hills: Although this region is dominated by dwarves (who are typical of those in my dwarven article) the gnomes here are themsleves isolationist, trading guardedly with Greyhawk and more openly with their dwarven allies, always prepared against the region’s many hazards. The Flinty Hills: The gnomes of the west pledge allegiance to Nyrond, sending critical mineral wealth to Rel Mord via a long road of guarded caravans. Honest, loyal and brave, they show themselves as valuable allies to the Crown time and again. Those of the east tend to have a disdain for all those, including gnomes, that pledge allegiance to any outside power. They do not trust Nyrond, Ratik, North Kingdom, any reclaimed part of Bone March, or even the people of the Adri, only the local hillmen winning their trust. Relations between the two regions can be strained sometimes over the loyalty the western gnomes have to Nyrond. Ratik: The gnomish lords in this region are the same as any other of the locals: strong, doughty, brave, and open. Their kin in the Blemu Hills are the same way, although they are much less trusting of outsiders, having been surrounded by humanoid enemies since 563 CY. The Ratikkan gnomes are pledged to work with their allies in a spirit of mutual aid against barbarian or North Kingdom raids, although they are not pleased with the way Lady Evaleigh is ruling Ratik. The Hollow and Hestmark Highlands: Gnomes here are good, honest and true, always ready to welcome an ally against the evil of the Spine Ridge, the Vast Swamp, or Ahlissa. Like all the other peoples of the region, they do not give their friendship easily, and are suspicious of allies at ﬁrst, but once they give their friendship, it is for life. Chapter Two: Playable Races 203 Nezumi The nezumi, known derogatorily as “ratlings”, are a race of bipedal rat like humanoids, the result of ancient Suel magical experimentation. Abandoned by their Suel creators as a mistake, Nezumi today are wild, ﬁerce, and primitive. They are survivalists in a grim terrain, and their outlook is coloured by the harsh realities of their existence: barren land, hazardous natural features, and deadly predators, from eiger and jebli to terrible oni. Unwelcome in most settled lands in western Oerik, most nezumi live on the edges of civilization from the Celestial Imperium to Zahind and even the Sunelan Coast.  They are rarely encountered in the eastern lands of the Flanaess. Nezumi look like nothing so much as humanoid rats. They stand upright, roughly as tall as a human. They have long snouts, pink ears, and pronounced incisors, like ordinary rodents. Their bodies are covered with rough fur, ranging in shade form white through gray and brown to black, sometimes solid and sometimes patterned. Fur patterns tend to run in nezumi families. The nezumi have ﬁve-ﬁngered hands, opposable thumbs, and sharp claws. Their long tails are mostly hairless and have the same pink coloration as their ears and palms. Their legs are bent like those of rats and have only three toes. Nezumi Traits Your Nezumi character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2 and your Dexterity increases by 1. Age. Nezumi reach maturity around age 5. Compared to humans, nezumi usually don’t live longer than 40 years. Alignment. Lacking sense of property, home, or community, nezumi tend strongly toward chaotic alignments. Most nezumi are good, but are often suspected of evil, due to their appearance. Size. Nezumi are 5 to 6 feet tall, weighing between 130 and 160 pounds. Your base size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet and you have a climbing speed of 20 feet.

Olves (Elves) Known at the “olve” to the Flan people, Elven society is much more loosely organized than that of the dwur, as you might expect. Being one of individual freedom, it is based on the belief that olves will willingly work with each other, as opposed to the belief that they should be required to do so, as in dwur society. The olves are traditionally organized into a wide variety of different families, all of whom are loosely organized under a leader with varying titles: Duke, Prince, Count, etc., based upon their group’s power. Communal discussion is often used to reach political decisions when dealing with other races or other bands of olves, and so at the highest levels of olven politics, leaders often try to gain the greatest amount of community support for their decisions, as it is inherent that leaders cannot act unilaterally. Olven society is egalitarian as it relates to gender. Many of the great olven rulers, both past and present, are women, and they are usually renowned for their fairness in judgement. Olven men and women serve with equal respect in authority at all levels of society, and this even extends to the military, where even the earliest tomes speak of female elven cavalry riding unicorns. Everyday life for most olves consists of hunting, meditating, researching, Chapter Two: Playable Races 205 patrolling, or teaching the young during the day. Olves in wilderness settings often care little for mineral wealth—they prefer to barter for objects they might need, and deal with wild Flannae hunters rather than more civilized men. Those in urban settings, of course, use coin to a much greater extent. Their homes are often elaborately carved tree-houses or giant lodges, longhouses and cabins, (a custom likely borrowed from the Flan) in wilder areas, but with elaborate woodcarving techniques to create large houses and less rustic lodges in urban areas. Although most elves live in forests or wooded regions, they still conduct mining for metal, which they use to make swords, armor and jewellery. Amongst the other races they tend to have the best relations with humans and hobniz. Noniz are greeted cordially, and often they will partner with olves when it suits both races. Most elves, however, except in regions like Geoff, the southern Vesve, and Sunndi, prefer to live apart from dwarves. The elves of the Timberway, the Sable Wood, and other barbarian forests dwell completely separate from their Suel neighbours, preferring to live in mutual separation. In general, olves either show respect for human progress and innovation, or blame humanity for many of the ills that plague the world at the moment— from Iuz and the evil in the north to the horrible suffering and misery caused by the Aerdi over the centuries. Some of the olven people were present in the lands of the Flanaess for many centuries before the ﬁrst human kingdoms arose there. Originally established in the Crystalmists, there have been olven city-states existing here for millennia, as often at war with the dwur of the Hellfurnaces as they were allied against their shared foe, the giant nations of the Sheldomar Valley. Other olven communities exist outside the Flanaess both along the Sunelan Coast and in the upper echelons of the Celestial Empire in the far west. Eventually the olves were driven from their mountain cities and citadels when they were betrayed by their human allies in the Suel Imperium, when the Suel and Drow acted in unison to attack the elves. This great war depleted both sides and it ended in an essential stalemate with the drow being forever driven underground while the elves fractured and migrated east across the Flanaess (with scattered bands going west as well). Known as the War of Light and Dark, it was at this time that a number of eladrin were dispatched to Oerth by powerful Fae Lords to aid the olvenfolk. After the end of the conﬂict, some of them remained and intermingled with the native elves.  These eventually became distinct from their brethren and are now known as the gray, or faerie, elves. Ironically, the branch of olvenkind that might possibly claim to be closest to their historical ancestors is also a group despised  nearly as much as the Drow by other elves: the Valley Elves. The rift between the valley olves and their cousins stems from the same wars that drove the drow underground. The valley elves were deceived into allowing passage of the drow through a mountain pass they controlled, not knowing (so they claimed) that the drow were serving Lolth and had recently declared war on their cousin olves. While never formally condemned by their relatives, the valley elves have been universally shunned by them ever since. The ﬁrst real olven kingdoms were founded in the central Flanaess, battling both the Flan kingdoms to the south, which was eventually replaced by Vecna’s Empire of the Spidered Throne, and worked with the migrating Oerdian Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 206 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. warriors of what is now Furyondy against the mad sorcerer Tzunk, who sought to dominate all the lands around the Nyr Dyv. These wars weakened most of the olven realms, causing them to withdraw into the forested regions they preferred, or to gather in the remaining homeland of Celene. Many olves integrated peacefully with the new arrivals, with the principles of mutual friendship, acceptance and tolerance being formed by the many peoples who came to found Geoff. Similar bonds were made between the Suel who came to Sunndi and Idee and the olves already living there, and when the old Flan warrior-clans were absorbed into the duchy of Ferrond (later Furyondy), the olves of the southern Vesve were happy to continue the alliance against the more evil Flan clans of the north. By this time, several distinct olven ethnic groups had emerged: The Grugach, or wild elves, who hated humans and wanted nothing to do with them; the sylvan, or wood elves, who dominated the deepest forests, the gray, or faerie elves, who were thought to be the most connected to the Seldarine, and recognized as unofﬁcial leaders of the whole olven people; and the high elves, who dominated dells, prairies and light forests, the most open to dealing with men. In the far west of Oerik, the only known olven sub-race are the high elves who form an important part of the bureaucracy of the Celestial Empire. Sub-races

The high elf and wood elf  sub-races presented in the PHB may be played as presented in that tome. It should be noted that wood elves are more often referred as Sylvan Elves on the Flanaess. Drow are rarely seen on the surface of Oerth but play a pivotal role in the Underoerth. However, on Oerth, Drow are wholly and irrevocably evil and thus should not normally be permitted as a playable race. Extra-planar elves like the Eladrin and Shadar-Kai are certainly not usually encountered on Oerik, there is no reason why either can’t ﬁt into the setting.  Eladrin speciﬁcally do have a history on Oerth for it is they who aided the olves of Oerth in their War of Light and Dark against the Drow. Many Eladrin who fought in these wars formed lasting bonds with native Oerik elves and the fruit of those bonds became the Gray, or Faerie, elves of the Flanaess. Sea elves from MToF could be a playable race in a maritime focused campaign. Players should also note that the elves of Oerth are unlike their cousins on other worlds (like those from Toril or Krynn). The elves of Oerth are slight of stature (averaging 5 feet) and fair of complexion. Hair and eye coloration vary by kindred. High elves are usually brown-haired and green-eyed. The noble gray elves have either silvery hair and amber eyes, or pale golden hair and violet eyes (the second type commonly called faerie or fey elves). The hair colour of sylvan elves ranges from yellow to coppery red, and eye colour is a shade of hazel or green. Wild elves are the smallest of the elven folk, but otherwise resemble the wood elves. Valley elves appear to be taller versions (of nearly human height) of the gray elves. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. The following sub-races may also be played: Chapter Two: Playable Races 207 Avariel The avariels, or winged elves, are without a doubt the most reclusive and least numerous of the elven subraces on Oerth. Many sages have long dismissed them as creatures of myth. In truth, they were once numerous but were a;l but wiped out during the War of Light and Dark and only a small numbers of avariels still dwell in Oerik, concealed in hidden enclaves and remote regions. The most striking feature of the avariels is their soft, feathered wings. These wings have spans of anywhere from twelve to sixteen feet and are usually white, but may also be gray, brown, black, or speckled. Avariels take great pride in their wings and spend long hours grooming them. Their skin is pale, often porcelain white, with tinges of blue or faint silver. They have silverwhite or black hair, with other shades being rare but not unheard of. The avariels’ eyes are rather large and more expressive than those of other elves, and they tend to be brilliant shades of blue or green. A few avariel have scintillating violet eyes as pure as amethysts. Avariels stand 5’9” tall on average, with thin, graceful limbs and angular facial features. They are the most beautiful and striking of the elven races, although too often this beauty is marred by haughtiness and condescension toward their land bound kin, whom they often pity. Avariels are even more delicate than other elves, and their movements are quick, calculated, and graceful. They prefer to wear loose ﬁtting, diaphanous clothing that catches the wind in ﬂight and ripples and weaves in the air. Armor is almost never worn, because it tends to weigh the avariels down and hinder their graceful motion. Avariels cannot ﬂy while wearing heavy armor. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 208 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Avariel have a loose-knit social and political structure which stresses individual freedom. The family is the basic social unit, and groups of families are gathered in clans which owe allegiance to a tribe. Tribal holdings may be extensive, but most tribe members will choose to live in the tribal village itself, which offers the protection of numbers. Flight. You have a ﬂying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor. Keen Sight. You have advantage on Perception rolls that require sight. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Olven and auran. Gray Elf Taller and grander in physical appearance than others of their race, gray elves have a reputation for being aloof and arrogant (even by elven standards). They have either silver or pale golden hair and amber or violet eyes. Gray Elves built the old olven cities which now stand abandoned or were given up to other races as they moved through. They practice the oldest elven arts, but hide from the eyes of younger, shorter lived races in their mountain keeps. They wear complex gowns and ﬂowing robes, favouring clothes the colour of pure driven snow, the noon day sun, silver and gold, with accessories of polished leather, and contrasting colours and jewels. Gray olven citadels are a rarity in these times. Celene has one of the greatest population of gray elves and is ruled by Yolande, Lady Rhalta of Elvenkind, a Gray Elf queen. Sunndi and the Lendore Isles perhaps are the only other two in 576 CY, although Highfolk have  a comparatively high (for gray elves) population as well. Gray Elves are reclusive and isolationist. While their xenophobia towards other races, even other elves, is not quite malicious, they are not fond of spending time with “lesser” races. They hold the idea of racial purity highly. This is evident in how long Celene has remained hidden, in it’s mountain meadow sanctuary, to the point that some of it’s members have formed a resistance group, rebelling against it’s isolationist policies. Gray Elves, perhaps more so than any other olven sub-race, believe in the superiority of magic over physical strength, and produce some of the most gifted mages—certainly the most knowledgeable even if not the most powerful. They’re skilled crafters of magic items, particularly tomes and scrolls, and this combined with their pursuit of knowledge leads to extensive libraries, which they share with other elves. This combination of intense academic interest and xenophobia to other races, means many elven settlements and communities depend on elves from other sub-races to support them in more physical tasks and the upkeep of their realms.

Valley Elf Accepted by neither olves nor men, the valley elves have simply withdrawn from both and carried on their lives. Valley elves are unusually tall, some of them growing to the height of humans, with hair colour of silver or gold and eyes of amber or emerald. They are shunned by other olven sub-races, who do not consider them “true olves” but are greeted with goodwill by noniz. Valley olves are distrustful of outsiders, to the point of xenophobia but despite this they work closely with the gnomes and humans of the Vale of the Mage in defense of their mutual home. Most needs of the valley olves are provided by the Mage of the Valley. Foraging makes up for the rest. Valley elves are diverse in their magical inclination. They live inside the tropical climate of the Vale, which is humid and bountiful in fruits such as bananas and idani. Idani wood is also the olves favoured wood for making bows and arrows. It’s also full of many types of predators and monsters, many of which seem to have ﬂed to the Vale after being pushed out of local lands or been deliberately introduced by the Mage himself. This resulted in the residents being ever vigilant, both to intruders and predators. This lifestyle means the olves of the Vale often work as guards and militia for the Mage, and any young elf who shows no skill with magic is drafted into physical training. Those that do show aptitude with magic are expected to excel and are considered superior to those with no magical skill. Although ruled by the Mage, he allows the residents of the Vale to form their own systems of governing and elect their own leaders. The valley olves are divided Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 210 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. humans. They live close to the land in a half agricultural, half hunter gatherer lifestyle, and wear rugged clothing consisting of kilts, boots and shirts made of animal skin and rough plant weaves. Their skin is darker than other elves, and they excel at stealth, even compared to their kin. Wild elves are small compared to other elves, and have yellow to coppery coloured hair. Wild elves favour natural magic, and many are druids or sorcerers. They feel no special duty to anyone beyond their own folk and the forest that is their home. Troubles beyond their borders are best kept there. At the same time, they harbour little ambition beyond a peaceful coexistence with nature. If anyone is fool enough to disturb a grugach realm, these elves take to arms and ﬁght in earnest. Grugach master the basic weapons needed to hunt and forage in the wood. Every copse of trees becomes a sniper’s nest, and each forest meadow is an ambush point. Grugach think in terms of Frana-an (‘Insiders’ or ‘Friends’: one’s one tribe and to a lesser extent, other grugach tribes), and Malza-an (‘Outsiders’ or ‘Enemies’: everyone else). Grugach are cold and mistrusting of other races, even other elves, either seeing them as effete snobs or liable to steal from the tribe. Druids, and to a lesser extent, tend to be the only exception to the rule of outsiders, earning respect through their profession alone. Even still, this is not often enough to pardon trespassing. To outsiders the Grugach deem worth their time interacting with, they prefer to behave with deadpan solemnity and impassive courtesy. They may joke among themselves, but outsiders do not get that privilege and jokes from them are seen as insults. Trespassers that are deemed innocent are drugged, blindfolded and bound, and then led to among three principal communities and four unnamed small villages, with a few dozen living scattered near the valley’s entrance. Valley elves do not believe in secrets among the community, and criminals and strangers are questioned openly before the closest olven community. This sense of community is also connected to wealth; magic items are communal and the elves feel no need to hide their valuables from each other. Despite this sense of community and intense training, many Valley elves struggle keeping or making group tactics during a ﬁght, preferring to depend on themselves and hope their neighbour does the same. Valley olves worship Ehlonna and tend to focus on nature and animal domains. The Seldarine have rejected Valley Elves, although the reason is not clear why. Ability Score Increase.

Even other elves consider them barbaric. These tribal elves contend that other elves have given up their primal essence to be more like Chapter Two: Playable Races 211 while grugach are independent individuals like most elves, loyalty to the tribe is paramount.

If deemed evil, or they resist capture, or are perceived to be thieves the Grugach will deem them a threat that needs to be eliminated for the saftey of their tribes. Each tribe’s identity centres around a totem animal or place. They’re semi nomadic, travelling to better winter grounds for hunting and shelter, and better summer grounds for small garden farms. Tribes consist of about six family units of ﬁve to ten elves each, living in a widespread camp of several ground-level or tree-level huts. Tribal territories are ill deﬁned, usually by borders formed by barricades formed to look natural or numerous traps or centered around the locations of vegetables gardens in the summer camps and sturdier wooden huts of the winter camps. Grugach that wander into another tribe’s land are taunted and sent away, but not met with the silent aggression non Grugach are. Grugach can move from tribe to tribe, typically due to marriage, but must submit to a initiation rite by the tribes druid. This is the same as swearing loyalty to a tribe— Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 212 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Regional Olven Populations The Adri: The elves here are bound in a small kingdom ruled by a lord who wants nothing to do with either the gnomes of the Flinty Hills, the men of Ratik, the men of North Province, or the dwarves of the Rakers, distrusting them all. Keeping his nation isolated, he believes, is the key to survival. While he trades with other peoples, he carefully watches them when they are in his territory. Kingdom of Celene: The most prominent of the olven nations, Celene is currently ruled by Queen Yolande. Her forces patrol the nation’s borders as well as the Welkwood, and are closely allied with the elves of the Gnarley Forest, but they avoid the dark and twisted Suss Forest for the monsters known to lurk within. Celene played a pivotal role in the Hateful Wars, and her borders have remained closely guarded since. Other races tend to ﬁnd the Elves of Celene to be haughty. This stereotype can be quite accurate when dealing with the aristocracy and nobility but the common folk tend to be much like Elves found elsewhere on the Flanaess. Some whisper that the People of the Testing are striving to gain inﬂuence over Yolande, and to defeat those other elves who are opposing them. The Celestial Empire:

While olvenkind ﬁrst came to prominence in eastern Oerik, several wandering groups eventually came to reside in the west, in what is today the Celestial Empire. Many joined with the Celestial forces during the Demon Wars and later came to serve as advisors and administrators in the new Empire. To this day, all ministerial positions are high elves, and they also make up a signiﬁcant portion of the Celestial bureaucracy. Duchy of Ulek: Long a close ally of Keoland, the Duchy is a melting pot of human, olven, and half-elven inhabitants; the Duchy has the largest population of half-elves in the Flanaess. The Duchy has always nurtured close ties with Celene, and was one of the instigators of the Hateful Wars. The Elves of Ulek are perhaps the most open to other peoples and cultures. Highfolk & the Vesve Forest: Technically a vassal state of Furyondy, Highfolk is the gateway for the Vesve Forest— and Perrenland generally trades via the town as well. As part of the grand alliance of good that has ﬂourished here for millennia, the elves of the southern Vesve are good, kind and honest. They worked with the brave Flan warriors in what is now Furyondy before the migrations, and they will continued to do so with the modern nations against Iuz, the Horned Society, or whoever else their foe is this day. Those of the north, however, are isolationist and almost xenophobic towards humanity, blaming men for the evils of Iuz and the Society, and bitter from the endless ﬁghting they must endure against humanoids in that region. County of Sunndi: Originally a vassal of the Great Kingdom, Sunndi is now an independent member of the Iron League, a group of nations banded together to resist the predations of their former liege. Despite a human majority in their population, Sunndi is under gray olven rule, and much of the state’s culture shows a heavy inﬂuence of the elves. Chapter Two: Playable Races 213 Lendore (Spindrift) Isles: These eastern islands are largely isolated from the Flanaess. Indeed, the Lendorian dialects spoken by the human and elven residents are essentially a separate language, with very little being understood by those who speak Elvish or Suloise. Humans only dwell on the southernmost isle, and non-elves are rarely allowed elsewhere. The Bramblewood Forest: How many elves live in this vast forest is unknown, as most of it is claimed and owned by Ket. It is thought, however, that the elves live in their own separate cities, away from the main Kettish populations. The Dim Forest and the Oytwood: These elves are coming into increasingly unfriendly relations. Representatives of both groups travelled together to Celene over ten years ago; when they came back, the two groups came into a slowly rising, but deﬁnitely troublesome, quarrel. The Burneal Forest: The elves of this region are wild, barbaric, and uncivilized (most being Grugach). Some of them deal well with foreigners, while others hate and loath anyone not of their own race, and happily kill and eat them. The Celadon Forest: The elves of this region have always preferred to maintain their independence from humans, and while they bear man no animosity, they would prefer to send him on his way as soon as possible. This city houses the largest elven city in the Flanaess, outside those of Celene. These elves deal well with the Urnstmen, but past and present injustices by the Nyrondese mean that they trade little and care even Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 214 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. less for the people of that region. King Lynwerd has calmed tensions to prevent civil war, but he cannot calm the anti-Nyrondal ﬂames of resentment boiling here. The Celestial Imperium: Unlike the olve of the Flanaess who tend to keep separate from human society, olves in the far west are completely integrated into human, i.e. celestial, society. Being one of the founding peoples of the Celestial Empire, most olve of this realm are of the high elf variety and nearly all serve as administrators in the Celestial bureaucracy. Those with arcane skills often serve in the Ministry of Faith and Magic while others serve as battle mages in the imperial armed forces. Olve in the west rarely speak olven, defaulting to Suh instead. Dreadwood: The elves of this region live in three different cities in the east, center and west of the forest. Half-orcs and dwarves are wise not to show their faces in this region, nor are citizens of the Yeomanry, the Sea Princes, or Gran March welcome in elven households. Fellreev Forest: The elves within this region are savage and violent, as ready to ﬁght each other as the local humanoids, monsters, or bandits. All attempts to tame the elves have failed, and indeed the grugach, who have many positions of power here, ceremonially kill men and dwarves. The Gamboge Forest: The elves who dwell here are friendly and good, but ﬁercely independent. They trust neither the Pale nor Nyrond, knowing well that both states covet their territory. They enjoy relative peace, except with the humanoids and monsters of the wood. The Gnarley Forest: The elves of this region are the most classic version— rustic, green-clad people with pointy ears who are masters of the wilderness. While they treat well with the people of Verbobonc, they are wary of any attempts by Furyondy or Dyvers to intrude on their territory, gravely distrust most of Greyhawk, and outright hate the people of the Wild Coast. Grandwood Forest: The elves here have a long tradition of being freebooting bands of raiders and heroes, packing up their tents, and even collapsible treehouses, moving their towns to avoid being captured by enemies. They consider South Province to be their greatest foe, though they have little love for the people of the Hestmark Highlands or Rel Astra either, only treating with their fellows in the Lone Heath. Nutherwood/Phostwood: The elves here are suspicious of most outsiders except the Flan, with whom they are strong and brave friends. Strong allies of the Tenha, the two peoples have often aided each other in matters of war against their mutual enemies. The two peoples share many cultural and life elements as well, though the elves ﬁnd the incorporation of Oeridian architecture and battle tactics into Tenha society to be somewhat annoying. Rieuwood/Menowood: While allied with the Sunnd, and the dwarves of the Hollow and Hestmark Highlands, the elves of these regions are suspicious of Holgi the Hirsute and his dealings with the Oeridians of Irongate and Onnwall. They deal well with Idee, often exchanging goods and information between peoples. Chapter Two: Playable Races 215 Spikey Forest/Sable Forest/Hraak Forest/Timberway: The elves in these forests, surrounded by barbarians, prefer to live apart from their neighbours, although they can reﬂect the tendencies of their human neighbours: The Hraak people are cruel and savage: the Sable people are cold and aloof, those of the Timberway friendly and jolly, and those of the Spikey Forest strong and brave. Sessik (Lizardfolk) Lizardfolk, Sessik as they are known to the Flan people, are tall humanoids that look like a cross between a powerfully built human and a lizard. They have a long tail, clawed hands, and a toothy jaw. They are usually six to seven feet in height, with gray, green, or brown scales. Lizardfolk use their tails, typically three to four feet long. Lizardfolk commonly weigh from 200 to 250 pounds. . Lizardfolk make their homes from temperate marshes and swamps to tropical jungles. They are passable swimmers however, and may also be found in underwater cave systems. Their society is primarily patriarchal, with the strongest member normally in charge. Shamans are typically counsellors, and normally do not lead tribes. Wherever they make their home, survival is the main priority for any lizardfolk. Lizardfolk have been encountered in signiﬁcant numbers in the Gnatmarsh (who are especially known for the skill at trap-making and poison use), the Hool Marshes, the Mistmarsh, the Rushmoors, and the Vast Swamp. They are also known to exist in great numbers in both the Amedio Jungle and the rainforests of Hepmonaland. Some sages even propose the insane hypothesis that these folk once had a high evolved civilization of their own. In the west, a variety of Lizardfolk dwell mainly in the wilderness of Wunan, speciﬁcally the  Miasmin Marsh region where they are known as Sobeki and resemble more alligators or crocodiles than they do lizards. To most people in civilized lands, Lizardfolk are little more than mindless savages although there are more than few locations around the Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 216 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Flanaess where Lizardfolk tribes and rural vilages of humans or demi-humans live in peace and, in some cases, even in harmony and alliance. Lizardfolk characters can played as outlined in Volo’s Guide to Monsters. Lizardfolk suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Shifter When the insane Suel Mages of Power began their physical transmutation experiments following their invasion of northern Zahind, not all experiments were successful.  The Nezumi, for example, were considered a waste of effort early and they were abandoned.  Other experiments to transmute humans and other races into new forms sometimes appeared to fail but had unknown and long-lasting impacts on the subjects bloodlines. Within a couple of generations of the creation of the “beast lord” races, bestial traits began expressing themselves in the descendants of some of those early experimental victims. Often believed by family and friend alike to be victims of lycanthropy, many early Shifters were exiled from their homes or killed outright. Since that time, most have learned how to best hide their bestial nature.  Many Shifters are still found in the Zahind region where they fall outside the caste system and often operate on the fringes of society.  Others ﬂed their homeland and have spread across most of Oerik although they are considered very rare anywhere outside the Zahind region. With the above lore changes, Shifter characters can be played as presented in Eberron: Rising from the Last War. They suffere disadvantage on Charisma-based checks  in civilized lands should the Shifter’s nature become known. Chapter Two: Playable Races 217 So-karan The word “so-karan”, is a bastardized version of the Ancient Suel words for dagger and slave. This is an appropriate name for a race that the Ancient Suel themsleves created through foul sorcery: the Skulk. Skulks were developed entirely from Suloise humans—perhaps volunteers perhaps not—shortly before the Rain of Colourless Fire. No written evidence exists of their creation remain but divinations by multiple sages and wizards over the years indicate that the skulk was most likely designed by wizard/priests in the service of Syrul, the deity of lies, treachery, and deceit. It is assumed that they were intended to inﬁltrate the Imperial government in its latter days, as the war with the Baklunish grew more ﬁerce and chaos spread across the empire. A handful of Skulks spread out from the ruined empire after the Rain of Colourless, though a few may have left earlier, either on missions against the Baklunish or sensing the disaster that would soon engulf their realm. They almost certainly travelled among groups of normal humans, their identities concealed. It is not unreasonable to conjecture that they have spread to the very corners of Oerik and even beyond. The normal appearance of a Skulk is that of a albino-skinned humanoid with a near-formless face and pale blue, bulging eyes with no visible pupils. They have pointed ears like elves but they have no hair in their normal form. Skulks have no gender. Today many Skulks live stolen lives. When they encounter a person whose appearance or station they desire for themselves, the Skulk uses their mental powers to learn everything they can about the chosen target. Once they have all the knowledge they need, they quietly eliminate their target and assume his or her form, taking their place in life. Often a Skulk will keep the original alive and close for weeks, using their ability to read the victim’s mind daily to learn how to behave and speak without being detected. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 218 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Because they are so attuned to human shapes, Skulks cannot create unusual functional appendages such as extra arms or legs, an extra head, wings, large ﬁns, gills, and the like. Minor items like claws, horns, fangs, webbed ﬁngers, long fur, and so forth are possible, however. Skulks may be found in any civilized region on Oerth, nearly always in cities in positions of relative wealth, comfort, and power. They prefer human cultures but are also found in demi-human and advanced humanoid lands.  They are entirely integrated into the human, demi- human, and humanoid societies they inhabit. They have no true society of their own. A Skulk can imitate either gender of a particular race, and can become pregnant in female form (but cannot cause another female to become pregnant). The child of a Skulk is always another Skulk to be lovingly raised and secretly trained in the use of its many powers. Skulks have a peculiar ability to instantly recognize one another for what they are. They leave each other entirely alone, not rendering aid to each other unless it is in their own best interests.

Skulks who are viewed in their natural form suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or  monstrous appearance (See page 110). Chapter Two: Playable Races 219 Spirit Folk Spirit folk are the descendants of humans and various feybspirits of nature. Spirit folk tend to be serene and calm, attuned to their surroundings and at peace with the world. Their spirit ancestry gives them an awareness of the spirit world, and they show little desire to manipulate that world through magic. They manifest a love and enjoyment of life that many humans can only envy. Spirit Folk are far more populous in western Oerik than eastern but they are found continent wide. Spirit folk appear as humans, usually resembling the local native population. Their eyes are slender and their mouths are small. Their eyebrows are very thin and their complexions are very pale or golden. They have no facial or body hair, but the hair on their heads is thick and luxurious. They appear in all the diversity of humans, and many come close to the ideal of human beauty in their society. Spirit folk typically live as part of human society. In the Celestial Empire they are accepted as equals in human communities, even when their true ancestry is known. They are members of human clans, citizens of the empire, and have blood relations who are entirely human. At the same time, they are part of the spirit world, and never feel completely at home in the mundane life of a human village.

Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 222 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Tabaxi While believed to have been created over 2,000 years ago by one or more mad Suel mages of power in the Zahind region, it is unknown exactly how the Tabaxi have subsequently spread widely across Oerik from the Celestial Imperium to Hepmonaland. While not common in the civilized regions of the Flanaess they are thought to have a great civilization, somewhere deep in the Amedio Jungle. The few Tabaxi that are seen in civilized lands of the Flanaess are almost always of the default generic feline type.  These have features of domestic cats and are rare but can be found in major urban centers across Oerik. The Amedian Balam sub-race are found infrequently in ports of the Sea Princes and southern Keoland and can sometimes be seen as far north as Gradsul; this type appear to be humanoid versions of jaguars, with a rarer still, pure black variety known to exist. Other sub-races exist elsewhere such as the Leonins of southern Hepmonaland, the Shir and Bagheer who form elite ruling and espionage tiers respectively in the Zahindian caste system. Many are called by the being known as the Cat Lord to serve as warlocks, others are ﬁerce warriors or elusive scouts. Tabaxi Traits Tabaxi on the world of Greyhawk are divided into a number of sub-races. the default racial features and traits from PHB have been modiﬁed as follows. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 1. Age. Tabaxi have lifespans equivalent to humans. Alignment. Tabaxi tend toward chaotic alignments, as they let impulse and fancy guide their decisions. They are rarely evil, with most of them driven by curiosity rather than greed or other dark impulses. Size. Felid, Balam and Bagheer are slightly taller on average than humans and relatively slender. Leonin and Shir are typically over 6 feet tall, with some Leonins standing over 7 feet. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You have a cat’s keen senses, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of gray. Chapter Two: Playable Races 223 Cat’s Claws. Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modiﬁer, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Suh or Sunelan and one other language of your choice. All Tabaxi suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Sub-races Please select from among the following sub-races. Bagheer These ebon-furred masters of the shadows form an elite tier in the Zahindi caste system that sees them serve their Rajs as spies and assassins.

Your Dexterity and Wisdom both increase by 1. Bred Assassin. You have proﬁciency in the Stealth and Insight skills. In addition, you have advantage on all Stealth rolls while in shadow or darkness.

You let out a deep growl, targeting an opponent within 30 feet who is not adjacent to any of its allies, requiring that creature to succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 8 + your proﬁciency bonus + your Wisdom modiﬁer or become frightened of you for 1 minute. The target is allowed another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Success ends the effect. Once you use this ability, you require a short or long rest before you can use it again. Jungle Acclimated. You have proﬁciency in the Survival and Nature skills. Leonin The lion-like Leonin’s hail exclusively from the savannah regions around the Great Southern Desert in southern Hepmonaland.  They exist here in a near constant state of war amongst prides who defend their turf to the death against all intruders, be they gnolls, Touv humans or other Leonins. Abilty Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2. Bite. Your fangs are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.

Insightful Rulers. You have proﬁciency in the Insight and Persuasion skills. Tauryn Minotaurs are the dark descendants of humanoids transformed by the rituals of demon cults before and during the Demon Wars of western Oerik. Many entered the world of Oerth with their foul lord, Baphomet, to ﬁght in the demon armies against the celestials. These are effectively viewed as  “mindless monsters” by humans and demi-humans in all lands. In the closing days of the Demon Wars, just as the creation of Dragonborn helped turn the tide, several powerful celestials captured a number of minotaurs and, through arcane rituals known only to those of the upper planes, cast out the evil from these creatures who in turn fought for the celestials against their former kin. This new race of minotaurs divorced from the taint of the Abyss began calling themselves Tauryns to differentiate themselves from the monsters they once Chapter Two: Playable Races 225 Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 226 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. were. Today Tauryns are somewhat smaller than “wild” minotaurs, standing between 6 and 7 feet tall.  Although shorter, they are still ﬁerce warriors, and after the Demon Wars, many stayed within the Empire and serve in its military forces.  Others, not entirely purged of chaotic tendencies have moved beyond the Empire with many moving north to continue ﬁghting demons and humanoids in Pesh or even further aﬁeld to Mur where many are found in the gladiatorial pits and amongst the ranks of elite monster hunters. Tauryn are nearly unheard of on the Flanaess although they are seen from time to time in Baklunish lands. Tauryn Traits Your tauryn character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Alignment. Most minotaurs who have remained in the Celestial Empire lean toward lawful alignments, while those work as monster hunters, gladiators and mercenaries in Pesh, the Murian highlands and elsewhere tend toward chaotic alignments. Size. Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and they have stocky builds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Horns. Your horns are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modiﬁer, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Goring Rush. Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action. Hammering Horns. Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove that target with your horns. The target must be no more than one size larger than you and within 5 feet of you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proﬁciency bonus + your Strength modiﬁer, you push it up to 10 feet away from you. Imposing Presence. You have proﬁciency in one of the following skills of your choice: Intimidation or Persuasion. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur. Tauryns suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Tieﬂing Tielﬂings are treated differently in Greyhawk Rebooted5e than they are in the PHB. Tieﬂings as listed in the PHB would cause more panic and fear if they appeared on the streets of Greyhawk  or Tianshi than would an Orc or even an Ogre. The Tieﬂings of Oerth are more subtle in their ﬁendish appearance.  Rather than the variety of horns and antlers, tails and bright skin colours, Tielﬂings of the Flanaess usually  display ﬁendish traits that they can at least attempt to hide from the general population for, as mentioned above, should a Tieﬂing be discovered, at least in “good” lands, a tar and feathering, beating or worse may not be far behind. Simultaneously more and less than mortal, Tieﬂings are the descendants of humans and ﬁends. With otherworldly Chapter Two: Playable Races 227 blood and traits to match. Most tieﬂings never know their ﬁendish sire, as the coupling that produced their curse occurred generations earlier. The taint is long-lasting and persistent, often manifesting at birth or sometimes later in life. Despite their ﬁendish traits and netherworld origins, Tieﬂings have a human’s capacity of choosing their fate, and while many embrace their dark heritage and side with ﬁendish powers, others reject their darker predilections. Though the power of their blood calls nearly every Tieﬂing to fury, destruction, and wrath, even the spawn of a succubus can become a saint and the grandchild of a pit ﬁend an unsuspecting hero. Tieﬂings are never born to their own race, instead appearing as spontaneous mutations in human infants (no known olve, dwur or other types of Tielﬂings are known on the Flanaess). Greyhawk Tieﬂing traits usually manifest as small horns, small fangs or sharp teeth, claw- like nails, cat’s eye pupils or strange eye colour, they might give off vaguely offensive odours or spook domestic animals or a combination of any of these. Most Tieﬂings go out of their way to hide these traits going so far as to ﬁle their teeth, always wearing gloves or cowls or hoods for example. When living amongst “evil” populations, the need for secrecy is obviously not as important. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 228 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. It should come as no surprise that many Tieﬂings on the Flanaess are warlocks; their  ﬁendish ancestors are always looking for windows into Oerth. Demon Spawn Tieﬂings are far more common in western Oerik as a result of the Demon Wars long ago.  Hell Born Tielﬂings are most common in The Great Kingdom where many in the nobility, including the Overking himself, deal with devils and the like. Tiefling Traits Tieﬂings share certain racial traits as a result of their ﬁendish descent. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2. Age. Tieﬂings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer. Alignment. Tieﬂings might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many tieﬂings toward a chaotic alignment. Size. Tieﬂings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Sub-races Greyhawk Tieﬂings come in two varieties, those descended from demons and those descended from devils. Demon Spawn These Tielﬂings are descended from the union of a demon from the Abyss with a mortal human.  This activity is not unheard of, especially in the lands of Iuz, but Demon Spawn Tielﬂings can also be found in wild and untamed lands like the Bandit Kingdoms and even the Wild Coast and Pomarj. There are many Demon Spawn Tieﬂings living in the Davan Wastes and Wunan where they are common and do not require Monstrous Race checks. Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 1. Legacy of Chaos. You know the Vicious Mockery cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Ray of Sickness spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you ﬁnish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Crown of Madness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you ﬁnish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Natural Weaponry. You have either sharp claws or teeth. So long as you are not taking active measures to hide these features, you can use them to make a melee attack that causes 1d6 + your Strength modiﬁer. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Abyssal. Hell Born These Tielﬂings are descended from the union of a devil from the Nine Hells with a mortal human.  The vast majority of this type of Tieﬂing are found in either The Great Kingdom, where many noble houses have made pacts with devils in return for power over the centuries, the Horned Society where humanity and devilkind interact openly or in the Ryuujin Empire where the Lords of the Nine hold much sway. Chapter Two: Playable Races 229 Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Hellish Resistance. You have resistance to ﬁre damage. Infernal Legacy. You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Hellish Rebuke spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you ﬁnish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you ﬁnish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal. Tieﬂings who do not take measures to hide their ﬁendish heritage, or who are discovered suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Tortle Tortles are land-dwelling, humanoid tortoises. They walk upright but with a ponderous, rolling gait. They have leathery, reptilian skin and massive shells that cover most of their bodies. Only their heads and limbs stick out of their shells. Tortles are clumsy swimmers; they simply ﬂoat on the surface and paddle with their limbs. They can, however, hold their breath underwater for up to 10 minutes. Their natural ﬂotation usually allows them to slither through mud, bogs, and quicksand with ease. What many tortles consider a simple life, others might call a a life of adventure. Tortles are born near sandy coastlines, but as soon as they’re able to walk on two legs, they become nomad survivalists eager to explore the wilderness, experience its many wonders, put their skills to the test, and make new acquaintances. A tortle hatches from a thick-shelled egg and spends the ﬁrst few weeks of its life crawling on all fours. Its parents, old and near death, spend what little time they have life telling stories to their offspring. Within a year, the young tortle becomes and orphan, though not before it learns to speak and survive on its own. A young tortle and its siblings inherit whatever tools, weapons, and gifts their parents left behind. Each young tortle is expected to fend for itself. It leaves the place of its birth and ﬁnds its own corner of the wilderness in which to hunt, catch ﬁsh, and get by. Tortles are found most often around Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 230 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. the Hool Marshes with colonies also established on the islands of the Sea Princes as well as the Hook Peninsula in the Amedio region. Tortles don’t have their own pantheon of gods, instead they gravitate toward Celestian, Fharlanghn, Pelor, Pholtus and St. Cuthbert. Tortle characters can be played as outlined in The Tortle Package (a Tomb of Annihilation supplement). Tortles suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or  monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Triton Entire Triton nations exist on Oerth, eternally battling evil sea creatures such as sahuagin. While there is no reason a Triton character couldn’t be played in a Greyhawk campaign, they are really best suited for maritime, or even better, submarine oriented campaign. With DM approval, they can be played as presented in Volo’s Guide to Monsters. Vanara Vanara are a race of monkey-like humanoids, possessing brave hearts and inquisitive minds. Originally created by Suel mages of power, today they dwell in deep forests and high mountains of Zahind, building their villages and towns in such a way as to make a minimal impact on their natural surroundings. They gather in loose clans, but do not keep track of kinship at all, so “clan” is a very loose term for their associations. They subsist largely by hunting and gathering, rather than farming the land. They rarely come into contact with other races, and do not seek them out. Vanara are often viewed with amusement or even exasperation by members of other races, who ﬁnd their personalities childish and irritating. They are curious in the extreme, frequently badgering people with questions (sometimes very personal questions), picking small items up to examine them, opening doors to see where they lead, and generally exploring places where the human sense of propriety and order would demand they not go. They also tend to be bluntly honest, never couching a negative opinion in gentle terms or hiding their true feelings about anything. At the same time, they are incredibly loyal, Chapter Two: Playable Races 231 undeniably brave when they have to be, and genuinely kind. The vanara revere spirits of nature— spirits of the sun, the highest mountains, the oldest forests, and the widest rivers. They revere these spirits with deep personal devotion, offering prayers and songs to them at least daily. Vanara are very fond of humans, admiring them and respecting their power while laughing quietly at their conservative stodginess and apparent blind submission to nagas and tabaxi overlords.  Vanaras stand slightly shorter than humans, standing 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 feet tall and typically weighing 90 to 140 pounds. Vanara Traits Vanara charterers have the following traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Intelligence score increases by 1. Age. Vanara reach maturity around age 30, and can live to a little over 200 years old. Alignment. Vanara are ﬁercely chaotic, but rarely evil. They show little or no respect for social mores, rules with no purpose they can understand, or codes of discipline, and hate tyranny and oppression. Their only concession to social order is their acceptance of caste systems. Their religion allows for the possibility that different divine gifts might be given to different people, although it rejects any different valuation of those gifts. Vanara, there, might respect that religion is the province of the priestly caste among humans, but do not necessarily accord that caste the respect and veneration human priests might expect. Size. Vanara are usually 4 to 5 feet tall. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Powerful Grip. You have a climbing speed of 30 feet. Prehensile Tail. You can use your tail to hold objects no larger than half a cubic foot, weighing no more than 5 lbs. You cannot wield a weapon or shield with your tail. You have advantage on Dexterity (acrobatics) checks Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 232 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. while you aren’t holding an object with your tail. Brave. You have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that attempt to frighten you. Brash Honesty. You have disadvantage with Charisma (deception). Languages. You can speak Vanara, and read, speak, and write Zin. Vanara suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or  monstrous appearance when traveling in unfamiliar civilized lands (See page 110). Yokai Yokai are intelligent, shape shifting animals, able to shift freely between human and animal forms. Several sub races exist, deﬁned by the kind of animal form they can assume. They are typically found on the fringes of the Celestial Empire in western Oerik where they can mingle in human form but retreat to solitude when they desire. All Yokai begin their lives as animals, and the traits of their animal forms stay with them for the entirety of their lives. For example, a raven Yokai might have a pointed nose that hooks like a bird’s beak, and may make short, fast motions when surveying an area, or cock their head to the side while engaged in conversation. A cat Yokai may be solitary and self-reliant, while a weasel Yokai may be energetic and playful. Some Yokai are predisposed to act more like their animal forms than others. A raven Yokai may be prone to picking up shiny stones, coins, and other items that a raven might furnish their nest with from a market square, while a lizard Yokai may be inclined to observe the crowd at the same market square and blend in with its surroundings to the best of its abilities. Unlike lycanthropes, which tend to be less-than-agreeable and violent, Yokai are a reclusive, peaceful people. They are strongly connected to the spiritual world and do not reveal their true nature to anyone they do not implicitly trust due to the storied nature of their race and the many myths involving them throughout history. However, once they let someone into their inner circle, they become stalwart and loyal friends for the rest of their life. In animal form, Yokai are almost indistinguishable from normal animals except through magic. Naturally, their behaviour often provides proof of their intelligence, so careful observation of a Yokai in animal form can reveal that it is not what it appears to be. In human form, Yokai look exactly like normal humans, though (like lycanthropes) they often display some feature associated with their animal form. For example, a sparrow Yokai might have a sharply pointed nose, while a crab Yokai’s skin might seem hard to the touch. Yokai Traits Your Yokai character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 1. Age. Yokai can live over 200 years, but their life cycle is unique among the races of Oerth. For the ﬁrst century of their existence, Yokai exist strictly in an animal form, set apart from other beasts only by their higher than usual intellect. After its ﬁrst century of life, a Yokai can assume a human form,. Therefore, Yokai characters begin play at a hundred years old or older. Alignment. Yokai are just as diverse as humans, though they generally Chapter Two: Playable Races 233 Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 234 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. tend towards chaotic alignments due to their animalistic nature and love of freedom. Certain sub-races of Yokai have a predisposition towards good or evil alignments, though as with other races, nothing is set in stone. Size. Yokai in humanoid form range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your base size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You speed might change when you shapeshift. Beast Tongue. While you are in animal form, you can communicate with beasts and fey creatures that share your animal form or a form closely related (for example, a cat Yokai can communicate with a panther). In human form, you can understand beasts and fey creatures that share your animal form or a form closely related to it, but you can’t directly communicate with them. Shapechanger. Yokai are natural shapechangers, and as an action, you can change your form into that of an animal or back into human form. The type of animal depends on your sub-race, and each sub-race provides different traits. When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and hit dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious. You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however. While in animal form, you cannot use any of your class abilities, and your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change, but your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores stay the same. Suspicious. You have advantage with Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern if somebody is lying to you. Languages. You can read, speak and write Common and Yokai.

Sub-races The Yokai may have started out as being able to turn into several or maybe even all animals, but over time, they have drifted apart, creating several sub-races. Choose one of the sub-races below. Badger Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2. Animal Statistics.

You are familiar with less than hygiene environments. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws. Viper Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Poison Resistant. You gain advantage on all saving throws against poison. Animal Statistics. While transformed, your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and hit points stay the same, but you otherwise gain the statistics of a poisonous snake, as found in the Player’s Handbook. Yokai who are viewed transforming into or from animal form in regions outside western Oerik suffer disadvantage to Charisma checks due to their exotic or monstrous appearance (See page 110). Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

238 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Character Classes A ll character classes  and class options presented in the  PHB, Xanathar’s Guide to Everything (hereafter XGtE) and Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything (hereafter TCoE) are perfectly acceptable options in a Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY games. Some alterations to class features are presented within to help integrate the class deeper into the Greyhawk set and setting. DMs are free to allow these alterations or go with the original class features as written as should obviously be the case with anything presented herein. In addition there are several other sub- classes that make excellent options in classic Greyhawk campaigns and these will be detailed in the following pages. Artiﬁcer Artiﬁcers are those who spend most of their free time creating all sorts of magical devices, compounds and more. This class shines when played by imaginative players, as it requires you to describe your spells as being “cast” or applied by tiny tools or creations. Playing this makes you the brain of the group, the problem solver, as well as the strategist that infuses recordings into mundane objects and creates magical ones. For Greyhawk campaigns, artiﬁcers are to classes what Dragonborn and Tieﬂings are to races. They appear to pose an issue with ﬁtting into the classic Greyhawk set and setting of the world.  This is due mainly to the fact “technology” and Oerth have a mixed history. Things like ﬁrearms have largely been unwelcome in most Greyhawk games and simply ruled non-functioning and/or unavailable on Oerth (This was Gygax’s own take with one exception he made for his friend Don Kaye and his character, Murlynd). The usual explanatory back story has been that sages know how to make black powder but it either won’t work or is too unstable to be useful and therefore all magical, religious and secular authorities have banned its use and experimentation. On the other hand, the case can be made that technology has always existed in Greyhawk from the beginning from the Oerdian hero-goddess Daern and her Instant Fortress, to Murlynd himself; from the artifacts returned after an Expedition Chapter Three: Character Classes 239 to the Barrier Peaks, to the Machine of Lum the Mad; from Queen Ehlissa’s Fabulous Nightingale to the Apparatus of Kwalish... weird and wonderful technologies always existed on the periphery of the World of Greyhawk. A note must be made here—technology on the Flanaess does not use “steam power”, “fossil fuels”, or any other “chemical” process. Technology on Oerth is known as Artiﬁce Magic and it was created by the Noniz people who tell of it being taught to them by their god Flandal Steelskin. Wherever it originated, it is the rarest form of magic on the Flanaess with only a handful of masters even rumoured to exist. In 576 CY, with the exception of alchemy, artiﬁce magic remains exceedingly rare, so much so that outside the City of Irongate, it requires a DC 15 Intelligence (arcana) check to even know if its existence (Gnomes have advantage  on the roll). Gnomes remain the most frequent artiﬁcers while some dwur clans have learned from noniz artiﬁcers and adapted techniques to their own needs. Perhaps the best known non- alchemist artiﬁcers on the Flanaess are the Artiﬁcers Union of Irongate. Alchemist

By far the most common type of Artiﬁcer found on Oerik, Alchemists create all kinds of elixirs, salves and explosive liquids with random effects meant to help your party, giving them special effects. The alchemist’s supplies are both their tools and weapons of choice. Alchemists are found from The Great Kingdom to the Celestial Empire and the Loxodon of Zahind are known to have a special afﬁnity for the art. Armorer

An artiﬁcer who specializes as an Armourer modiﬁes armor to function almost like a second skin. The armor is enhanced to hone the artiﬁcer’s magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a Artificers Union of Irongate A guild of artiﬁcers and war wizards only recently founded, the Artiﬁcers Union provides intelligence and advice for Mayor Cobb Darg regarding the city of Irongate’s safety. Currently, the wizards are busy constructing magical portals to connect Irongate with other cities of the Flanaess—only one, leading to Mitrik, is currently complete. Guild artiﬁcers, most of them Noniz, have constructed many magical defenses for the city including ﬁre bellows to repel those attempting to breach the walls and magical devices that shield the city’s buildings from catapults and ballistae. The guild and school are housed within the Tower of Daern, built centuries ago according to the plans of the hero-goddess it is named for. The Tower is the second- tallest structure in the city, after the Cidereal Citadel in the center, and it includes six subterranean levels as part of the structure. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

240 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. formidable defense. This branch of artiﬁce magic has only recently be discovered on Oerik, speciﬁcally by the noniz artiﬁcers of Iron Gate. Cobb Darg, Lord Mayor of Iron Gate has recently commissioned a squad of Armourer Artiﬁcers be formed as an elite unit to aid in the defense of the city. Artillerist  (revised)

An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battleﬁeld. Again, Iron Gate is the center of this type of artiﬁce magic on Oerik. Adjustments have been made to this sub-class as follows: Ranged Specialist When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain the Archery ﬁghting style gaining a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. In addition you are proﬁcient with hand, heavy and light crossbows. Artillerist Spells Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Artillerist Spells table. These spells count as artiﬁcer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artiﬁcer spells you prepare. Artillerist Spells Artiﬁcer Level Spell 3rd ensnaring strike, hunter’s mark 5th melf’s acid arrow, cordon of arrows 9th conjure barrage, ﬂame arrows 13th locate creature, stoneskin 17th conjure volley, Eldritch Cannon At 3rd level, you learn how to convert a mundane crossbow (any type) into a magical device. Using woodcarver’s tools or smith’s tools, you can take an action to magically modify a crossbow. Modiﬁed crossbows are known as Eldritch Cannons. Once you’ve created an eldritch cannon, you can’t do so again until you ﬁnish a long Chapter Three: Character Classes 241 Eldritch Cannon Activation Arc Thrower The cannon crackles with electrical energy and a 60 feet long by 5 feet wide electrical arc shoots out in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Spell Save DC. A creature takes 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The electrical arc ignites ﬂammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. Flamethrower The cannon exhales ﬁre in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 ﬁre damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The ﬁre ignites any ﬂammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. Force Ballista Make a ranged spell attack at one creature or object within 120 feet. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. Lobber Your eldritch cannon can lob a magical grenade up to 120 feet. You decide which type of grenade that will be thrown: Exploding. Each creature within 20 feet of an exploding grenade must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Flash Bang. Each creature within 30 feet of an exploding grenade must make a DC 15 Constitution or be stunned. A stunned creature can make a saving throw to free itself of that state at the end of each of its turns. Poison. Each creature within 30 feet of a fractured poison grenade must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one). Smoke. One round after a smoke grenade lands, it emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area in a 20-foot radius. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round. Protector The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants you and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modiﬁer + your proﬁciency bonus. Rapid Fire Your eldritch cannon creates a number of glowing bolts of magical force equal to your proﬁciency bonus +1. You can direct them to hit one creature or several. A single to hit roll is required per target (i.e. if 3 bolts are directed at one target, its one to hit roll.  If two bolts are directed at one target and another bolt at a second target, two separate to hit rolls are required). Damage equals 1d4 per bolt plus your proﬁciency bonus. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

242 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. rest or until you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. You can have only one eldritch cannon at a time. If you create a second eldritch cannon, the ﬁrst one loses its special properties. The eldritch cannon is a magical object and its special properties only function for you. When you create an eldritch cannon, you decide which type of eldritch cannon it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table on page 241. Arcane Firearm At 5th level, you know how to turn a crossbow into a conduit for your destructive spells. When you ﬁnish a long rest, you can use woodcarver’s tools to carve special sigils into a crossbow and thereby turn it into an arcane focus. This can be the same crossbow that you’ve converted to an eldritch cannon. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise last indeﬁnitely. You can use your arcane ﬁrearm as a spellcasting focus for your artiﬁcer spells. When you cast a damaging artiﬁcer spell through the ﬁrearm, roll 1d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell’s damage rolls equal to the number rolled. Explosive Cannon Starting at 9th level, every eldritch cannon you create is more destructive: The cannon’s damage rolls all increase by 1d8. As an action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 6d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Master Blaster At 15th level you can now have two hand crossbow cannons at the same time. You can create two eldritch cannons with the same action (but not the same spell slot), and you can activate both of them with the same bonus action. You determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can’t create a third cannon while you have two. You can make an attack using the second eldritch cannon as a as bonus action with no penalty. Battle Smith

Battle smiths are exclusively dwarven on the Flanaess and they act as medics during war, users of construct companions to help their party members. They are in charge of protecting, having their steel defenders (whose form you can decide) jump in front of allies to stop attacks. When in peril, it’s the battle smith who will come to your aid while shooting or slashing your enemies to give you the much-needed treatments. The ﬁrst Battle Smith was Tharn Darkbeard, a dwur apprentice to the renowned noniz artillerist, Gim Gimson in Iron Gate. Through experimentation Tharn discovered the formulas required to create the ﬁrst steel defender.  Realizing the value of his invention, he proceeded to undertake a grand tour of the Flanaess teaching the art to dwur smiths from the Rakers to the Barrier Peaks. His knowledge came at a great cost and Tharn retired a wealthy man to a vast estate in the Cairn Hills in 553 CY. Chapter Three: Character Classes 243 throughout the Hold of Stoneﬁst.  Warriors among the hillmen of the Abbor-Alz, the Olman tribesmen of the Amedio Jungle, and the nomadic tribes of the Plains of Paynim, Rovers of the Barren, and both Wolf and Tiger Nomads also are typically barbarians.  Others are exiles, forced to leave their homeland under penalty of death. In western Oerik barbarians are common in the vast wilderness of Wunan not to mention the wastelands of Pesh. There are also hill tribes among the foothills of the Tyurzi and Zahind ranges and of course the Suh horse lord tribes of Sa’Han and the western Dry Steppes. Demi-human barbarians are less common than their human cousins but in dwur society  berserkers are both admired and feared while olven wild soul barbarians are revered among the Grugach of the Burneal Forest. Half-orc barbarians can originate from Iuz, the Pomarj, Bone March, The Horned Society, the Vast Swamp, and any number of wilderlands that are home to orc tribes. As with any class of adventurer, many barbarians adventure simply to acquire treasure and fame. They may also be bored with an endless life of hunting and trapping, and desiring some real excitement in their lives. They may be curious about the ways of their civilized neighbours seeking to learn more about them. Some barbarians may even adventure seeking to improve their status among their own people, using the wealth they acquire to prove their worthiness for marriage to a prospective mate. Barbarians, as civilized men understand them, can easily be very intelligent and eloquent people; their expertise is more with nature and Barbarian Barbarians are found throughout the Thillonrian peninsula, in the lands of the Frost, Snow, and Ice barbarians, as well as in northern reaches of Ratik, and Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

244 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. spirituality than with mathematics or sorcery. Many civilized people hold barbarians in a sort of awe, secretly fascinated by their appearance, mannerisms, language, or general behaviour. Some loathe barbarians for their rudeness, lack of table manners, and general ﬁlth; these are, quite obviously, stereotypes. Other men feel they can cheat the simple folk they meet, or openly welcome them for the amounts of money they will spend. In any case, barbarians are rarely interested in staying in a given place for a long time, unless they have formed close friendships with others in the area, have pressing business, or decide to retire. In the latter case, however, they often return home-a yearning to return to the wilds of his birthplace tugs at the heart of almost every barbarian at one point or another. Path of the Ancestral Guardian

Barbarians on the Path of the Ancestral Guardian are found throughout Oerik from the Pearl Ocean to the Solnor. They form the dominant type among the Paynim nomads, Ull, the Murian and Mulwari highlands and the desert tribes of the Bright and Flame deserts. This Path is also the dominant one among the Amedio Suel barbarians. Path of the Beast

Those who walk the Path of Beast are only known to exist among the Tiger and Wolf nomads of the northwest Flanaess. Those who tread this path form a cadre of elite warriors among the nomads.  While most in their tribes follow the path of the Chapter Three: Character Classes 245 totem warrior, those who follow the Path of the beast are believed to be actually possessed by the spirit of tigers or wolves respectively. Path of the Beast barbarians among the northern nomads are often the leaders of their clans or war parties. Path of Beast barbarians can also be found on the fringes of Zahind society where they may actually be descended from beastfolk races from some illicit union in the distant past and they are equally known to exist among the more primitive tribes of Touv in Hepmonaland. Path of the Battle Rager

On Oerik, Path of the Battlerager barbarians are not restricted to dwarves and can be of any race. Most were formerly trained as pit ﬁghters by the vicious Slave Lords or in the gladiatorial pits of Ull and Mur. The Slave Lords are a much- feared cabal who direct raids on seaside communities, carrying off prisoners to a wretched life of servitude. A battlerager might be one such unfortunate victim. A prisoner who shows signs of martial aptitude might be trained in an exotic ﬁghting style sure to fetch a high price from a bloodthirsty buyer. Path of the Berserker Berserker  barbarians are found in nearly all primitive cultures across the entire continent of Oerik but are especially common among the Murians of the highlands, the wilderness region of Wunan and there is a warrior society of Suel berserkers in Rhizia. Dwur berserkers are found among the clans if the Griff, Corusk and Crystalmist mountains. Goliath’s from Behow used to have a berserker tradition but they are now rare since their acceptance of The Way centuries ago. Path of the Storm Herald Storm Herald barbarians are perhaps the rarest sub-class on Oerth.  The Suel Thillonrian barbarians of the far north- east of Oerik are among those where these types of barbarians sometimes arise where they are disciples of the great god of the north, Vatun. These barbarians can channel storms around themselves to affect their environments. There are also rumours among the Ekbiri and Zeifans than some of the primitive tribes-folk of the Ataphad Islands wield the power of lighting and thunder when they enter battle. This path is all but unknown in the western lands of the Celestial Empire. Path of the Shaman

In most tribal cultures, the separation between the spiritual and physical worlds necessitates the existence of shamans; intermediaries that bridge the two worlds and keep them in balance. Problems in one world can often be traced to sources in the other, and it is the responsibility of a shaman to restore order in both worlds by resolving such conﬂicts. Many tribal shamans are severe, humourless sorts, acutely aware of the great re­sponsibility which they bear. They have been trained to safeguard the tribe, both its morals and its actual safety, and rarely take this responsibility lightly. The role of the shamans demands that they must speak out boldly for what is right, and yet when dealing with important members of the tribe they must learn tact and control. Committed to serving ancient spirits and maintaining tribal traditions, they are usually extremely conserva­tive, ﬁercely resisting any sort of religious or so­cial change. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

246 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Most try to make themselves paragons of moral respectability, strictly adhering to the stan­dards that the spirits demand the tribe follows. Few are so strong willed that they have no human failings, but their tribes usually expect them to live exemplary lives and may cease to re­spect them if they do not. Shamans have the unique ability to enter into a Trance that puts them in direct communion with the spirit world. While most “civilized” religions ascribe a certain unique quality to the souls of sapient creatures, many tribal societies rejects any such clear-cut distinction. A river has just as much of a soul as a human does, and animistic traditions may refer to animals and objects as “people” in the same sense that the word would be applied to humans, olve, or dwur. Everything on Oerth has a spirit of its own, with the same capacity for reason, emotion, and desire. There is nothing unique about the spirit belonging to a sapient creature—the fundamental nature of an entity’s spirit is not deﬁned by the entity’s intelligence, mobility, or ability to communicate. While in the spirit world, a shaman perceives all of the spirits around her— animistic spirits, and spirits of the dead, spirits of the place—that can commune with a shaman. However, not all spirits will necessarily deign to speak with her: while animistic spirits will almost never refuse to commune, spirits of the dead may have reasons to deny a shaman audience, and spirits of places might be too proud to commune with a wandering shaman. For the most part, communion between spirits and shamans is intended simply to reinforce the relationship between a shaman and the spirits, as well as to inform the spirits of the presence of a shaman in their midst. While spirits are aware of events in their immediate surroundings, they rarely have any knowledge of events that are not directly related to them. While a spirit of a location will know much of what has occurred within its territory, it may be unwilling to divulge details out of proud stoicism or out of loyalty to its more permanent residents. Unlike your more wild brethren, you don’t rage per se.  Instead you enter a Trance that has all the same mechanical effects of your class’ rage feature but instead of entering a violent blood-lust, you remain serene and oddly detached from the world as you gaze into the spirit world seeking the guidance of the totem spirits there. When in a trance, you appear to almost be an automaton, your eyes may roll back in your head or you may appear as though you are a puppet on strings as your actions are directed by the totemic spirits that guide you. Shamans are found across the length and breadth of Oerik wherever tribal societies dominate.  The Flan shamans of the Rover of the Barrens are greatly feared by their Wegwiur (Wolf Nomad) rivals.  The shaman of the devolved Suel Amedi people ingest a hallucinogenic concoction to aid them in communing with the spirit world while those of the Paynims often enter their trances through drumming and dance. The Shaman of the Korobokkuru people of western Oerik inhale vapours of a special incense to achieve their trance state. Medicine Man When you select this Path at 3rd level you gain proﬁciency in the Herbalist Kit and the Healer’s Kit. Spellcasting When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast druid spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the druid spell list. Unlike the Chapter Three: Character Classes 247 arcane formulas of wizards and sorcerers or the divine prayers of clerics, the verbal components of your spells take the form of shouts, chants and primal screams. Cantrips You learn three cantrips: druidcraft and two other cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn another druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level. Spell Slots The Shaman Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you ﬁnish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot. Spells Known of 1 st-Level and Higher You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the conjuration, divination, or evocation or spells on the druid spell list. The Spells Known column of the Shaman Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or higher. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the druid spells you know with another spell of your choice from the druid spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature and the spirit world. You use your Wisdom Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

248 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modiﬁer when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

6 Living tree branch Chapter Three: Character Classes 249 Totemic Guidance Starting at 6th level, your totem guides enable you to cast spells while in a Trance (i.e. rage) but you suffer disadvantage on rolls to maintain concentration if the spell requires it. Your Trance duration is the same as the normal rage class feature and you do not leave your Trance if you attack, take damage, or cast a spell of 1st level or higher during your turn. When you cast a spell that deals damage while in this Trance (i.e. you are raging) you can add your Rage Damage to that damage. Spirit Medicine At 10th level, as a bonus action you can choose to make a spell or cantrip more effective by ingesting or inhaling certain medicinal herbs, fungi or similar substances. You can activate the feature with the same bonus action used to activate your Trance and you receive advantage on your spell attack or cause the target to suffer disadvantage on their saving throws against your spell. Targets affected by an area effect spell all receive disadvantage to their saving throws. This effect lasts for one minute after which you suffer one level of exhaustion and you regain the ability to use this feature again after a long rest. Vision Quest Beginning at 14th level you have learned esoteric means of communing with your totemic spirits to gain insight into things that would normally be a unknown to you.  You can cast the Commune or Scrying spell as a ritual. This spell does not count against your prepared spells, does not require a spell slot and does not require material components. You can do this once and regain the ability to do so on a long rest. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

These barbarian’s channel the hidden powers of the animal spirits that protect their clan or tribe. Those who walk this Path are limited in their totem animal choices based on their homeland.

On a success you may add a bonus number of feet to your jump equal the difference between the DC and your actual roll.

252 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Turtle. While you’re raging, you add your Wisdom modiﬁer as a bonus to your attack and damage rolls. Whale. While raging, as a bonus action you can enter the square of any creatures whose size is equal to or smaller than your own and push them prone by making an opposed Athletics (Strength) check against them. The targets cannot stand up until you are no longer in their square. Path of Wild Magic

Wild Magic barbarians are incredibly rare on Oerik with some coming from the Burneal Forest and Adri forests in the east and on the fringes of the Suhfeng Marches in the far west. It is rumoured than some Grugach of the Burneal follow this path having acquired their abilities through exposure to some unknown arcane site while in the west Wild Magic barbarians can occasionally appear among the descendants of celestials who now live a primitive life in the wilderness of Wunan. The Adri forest of the Great Kingdom has always had strange rumours of its connection to inter- world and planar portals so it should not be surprising that some of the olvenfolk of that wood are sometimes touched by wild magic. Path of the Zealot

As a true warrior of its god, the zealot barbarian is a true un-killable machine. Filled with a divine or evil power channelled from those entities, a follower of this path becomes a damage dealing juggernaut. Many of the western Paynim tribes of the Dry Steppes follow this path as do many of the newer Flan converts to the faith of Pholtus of the Duchy of Tenh and Theocracy of the Pale. Other than these groups, the most frequently encountered barbarians of this type are invariably of euroz or demi-euroz blood. Bards Bards are commonly found throughout the Flanaess, particularly in urban centers such as The Free City of Greyhawk.  Many worship Olidammara, with others revering the quasi-deity Heward, Rudd (the goddess of chance), Fharlanghn (god of the road), Lydia (music and daylight), Hadyan (Baklunish goddess of song and poetry) and even the Old Faith.   Bards are also found among barbaric tribes, who revere Chapter Three: Character Classes 253 bards as preservers of tribal lore and customs, and sources of inspiration in battle. Bards are generally not thought of as great heroes or saviours. Most people assume the traveling minstrels, players and troubadours they encounter are actual bards, when in fact these are simple entertainers. Bards use music as a way to focus magic, and also have some of the talents of thieves. As a result, they are not always trusted in more suspicious communities, although their musical talents are welcome anywhere. Most wealthy musicians, whether actual bards or simple minstrels, rarely adventure—they will spend their time entertaining at the courts of nobles and kings rather than risking their hides in the wilderness. Bards who adventure are often poor or from the lower social classes, seeking both to advance their song repertoire and make money along the way. Most of them also have a love of traveling and a desire to see other lands. Some bards are great romantics, having a desire to engage in heroic deeds and then write songs about their exploits, while others travel to expand their song repertoires. In any case, bards are entertaining and friendly people to be around-their musical abilities often come with great dramatic or comedic talents, and they make valuable companions on the road, using both song and spell to assist their companions. They may not actually be adventurers, traveling as part of a carnival troupe and adding music to the performances of their colleagues. The storytelling ability of bards makes them valuable carriers of news and information. In a world where no rapid system of communication exists, bards are often the best and most reliable carriers of news to outlying areas. Some bards stay in one area for a long time, and can use their abilities as parts of theatre companies. Some bards also use their skills to write satirical or political songs and paeans, praising some heroes, ﬁgures and political policies, and viciously denouncing others. Powerful people may use them to dispense propaganda, or they may be a thorn in the side of the establishment. In the latter case, they often tend to have the authorities angry at them, which is precisely what they want. College of Creation

Creation Bards are incredibly rare in the east where they are really only found among the noniz of the Lortmils and Kron Hills who maintain a tradition that goes back to ancient times and their legendary hero, Uldra. Beyond these noniz bards, the College of Creation does have a number of practitioners in the lands of Mur on the northwest coast of the Gulf Of Ghayar. Here the concept of the Song of Creation is Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

254 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. well known and many explore its wonders and draw on that primeval song through dance, music and song. College of Eloquence

Master orators are in high demand in most of the civilized realms of Oerik from The Great Kingdom and Keoland in the east to the Celestial Empire and Zahind in the west. Unlike bards from many of the other colleges, eloquence bards invariably come from the upper classes where they are often tutored in literature, history, and rhetoric from a very young age.  Most serve as lawyers, court poets and heralds but some put their skills to work as demagogues and revolutionaries. It should be noted that perhaps the most renowned and highest skilled bards from this college hail from  the city-states of Mur, where public debate is a highly popular form of entertainment. College of Glamour Rarely found among humanity Glamour Bards are almost universally demi- human, most often olve, demi-olven, noniz or hobniz. Touched by the Feywild they use magic given or taught them by a fey entity. They are masters of enchanting, bolstering their allies with charming or terrifying their foes. It should come as no surprise that these bards are most frequently found in the demi-human realms of Celene, Highfolk and in various forest realms across the Flanaess.  They are rarely found in the west of Oerik for indeterminate reasons.

College of Geisha

Geisha are female entertainers, trained from a very young age to be hostesses in noble establishments across western Oerik, performing arts such as music, dance, games, and conversation. Some have also been trained in the ways of the ninja performing assassinations and other spy work. Geisha are rarely found outside the Celestial Empire and its adjacent nations. While most geisha are simple entertainers, those special individuals who also learn the arts of the ninja often take up an adventuring lifestyle. Note: This college might also be used to represent Baklunish courtesans who are also renowned spies and assassins extraordinaire. Bonus Proficiency Starting at 3rd level, you become proﬁcient with the war fan. Focused Dance Starting at 3rd level, when you choose this bardic college, you can use your body as a spellcasting focus, eliminating the need for an instrument. Fascinating Personality Also starting at 3rd level, whenever an ally rolls one of your bardic inspiration dice, they have advantage on the roll. Kunoichi At 6th level, as a bonus action, you can Chapter Three: Character Classes 255 expend one of your bardic inspiration dice to achieve one of the following effects: A Flurry of Stars.  You may expend a bardic inspiration die to throw an additional weapon (such as a shuriken) as part of your next attack action. On a hit you may add the bardic inspiration die to the damage done. Elemental Weapon.  You can expend one bardic inspiration to change the type of damage your next weapon attack does to an energy type of your choice. On a hit you may add the bardic inspiration die to the damage done. Ninja Sight. By expending a bardic inspiration die, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet for a number of minutes equal to the number rolled on your inspiration die. Puppeteer. You may expend a bardic inspiration die to impose disadvantage on your opponent’s next saving throw. The target takes a penalty to their next saving throw equal to the number rolled on your bardic inspiration die. Backstab. So long as you have advantage on the attack roll, or one of your allies is within 5 feet of your target, you may expend one of your bardic inspiration dice and add the number rolled to the damage done on a successful hit. Assassinate. By expending a bardic inspiration die, you may make an attack against a creature you have charmed. This attack has advantage and, if successful, is automatically a critical hit and you additionally add the number rolled on your bardic inspiration die to the damage done. Infatuation Starting at 14th level, hostile creatures have disadvantage on their saving throws against your enchantment and illusion spells. College of Jest

Bards of the College of Jest are known as jesters, harlequins and fools. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king’s royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand’s affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Heironeous’ cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh. While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester’s barbs with good humour. This e x p e c t a t i o n allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth. For the duchess with a taste for strapping young labourers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing p a r t n e r s . Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

256 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester’s satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her. Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist’s treachery or exposing a baron’s plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm. Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies’ spirits while casting doubt into foes’ minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle. Fighting Style At 3rd level, you adopt a style of ﬁghting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if something in the game lets you choose again. Protection. When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. Unlike the normal version of this ﬁghting style, you do not require a shield, instead achieving the effect by surprising the opponent with a sudden nudge or bump or a particularly biting insult... whatever it takes to give your ally an edge. Superior Technique. You learn one of the following maneuvers from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proﬁciency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modiﬁer (your choice). Chapter Three: Character Classes 257 You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you ﬁnish a short or long rest. Select from: Ambush, Bait and Switch, Disarming Strike, Distracting Strike, Evasive Footwork, Goading Attack, Quick Toss, or Trip Attack. Thrown Weapon Fighting. You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. Tumbling Fool At 3rd level, you master a variety of acrobatic techniques that allow you to evade danger. When you tumble, you gain the following beneﬁts for the rest of your turn:

❉ You can take a bonus action on

each of your turns in combat.

This action can be used only to

take the Dash or Disengage

action.

❉ You gain a climbing speed equal

to your current speed.

❉ You take half damage from

falling. Fool’s Insight At 6th level, your ability to gather stories and lore gains a supernatural edge. You can cast detect thoughts without expending a spell slot up to a number of times equal to your Charisma modiﬁer. You regain any expended uses of this ability after completing a long rest. If a creature resists your attempt to probe deeper and succeeds at its saving throw against your detect thoughts, it immediately suffers an embarrassing social gaffe. It might loudly pass gas, unleash a thunderous burp, trip and fall, or be compelled to tell a tasteless joke. Fool’s Luck Jesters seem to have a knack for pulling themselves out of tight situations, transforming what looks like sure failure into an embarrassing but effective success. At 14th level, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration after you fail an ability check, fail a saving throw, or miss with an attack roll. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your attack, saving throw, or ability check, using the new result in place of the failed one. If using this ability grants you a success on the attack, saving throw, or ability check, note the number you rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die. The DM can then apply that result as a penalty to an attack or check you make, and you cannot use this ability again until you suffer this drawback. When the DM invokes this penalty, describe an embarrassing gaffe or mistake you make as part of the affected die roll. College of Lore

Not to be confused with the rarer Old Lore lards, bards of this college are found across Oerik in almost every culture and society in one form or another. As a storyteller of the history and lore of the world, a bard from the College of Lore yearns for knowledge and stories. They could be poets composing tales of courtly love and noble genealogies in Nyrond to the herald of Mur who can recite the tales of the heroes of that people from the dawn Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

258 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. of creation to recent times. Because of their vast knowledge, they know exactly what can psychically hurt, confuse or distract other creatures, as well as can delving into other classes’ spell lists. College of Old Lore

Warrior, thief, spy, poet, woodland champion—the bards from the College of Old Lore, known amongst the Flan as Lyrists, are legendary ﬁgures who once served as the herald and teacher to great Flan kings, the champion of the common folk, and the keeper of lore long forgotten elsewhere. During the height of the Flan civilization the Old Faith was so ingrained into the average person’s daily life it was less of a religion and more of a way of life. The Oerth Mother, or Beory, as she is commonly known today, wasn’t worshipped so much in name and form, as the gods of the Flanaess are worshipped now, but revered as a spiritual force in every day activity. To the druids of the Old Faith, Beory is the embodiment of Nature. Their sacraments and rituals are completely based on the seasons and celestial phenomenon as they relate to Oerth. They consider themselves instruments of Balance. They celebrate the growth and vigour of the spring season and yet they also hold rituals that embody the coming of winter, decay and entropy. At any time they can by agents of law and good or perform acts that might seem chaotic or evil to an outsider. At the height of Flan civilization almost every natural area in the Flanaess had a primary caretaker as well as several lesser druid guardians based on the size and outside inﬂuence for that acreage of wilderness. There was also a very strict hierarchy to the druids with only a select few who held the higher positions of authority. At any time there was but one Great Druid who was said to oversee the whole continent of Oerik. The druids of the Old Faith were very much aware of Chapter Three: Character Classes 259 their own political shortcoming, which is why they came to form an order of special agents to promote change, being themselves more suited as watchers and guardians. These agents were trained in what has come to be known as the Bardic Colleges and it was these Druidic agents who were the ﬁrst true Bards of the Flanaess. Not just minstrels, but a practitioner of the Old Lore whose knowledge could almost be considered the equal of a sage. As at home in the king’s court as in the secret groves of the Great Druid, the bards of the Old Lore were always chosen from noble blood. As nobles themselves it was hoped that they would be able to inﬂuence and advise those in power and to keep a natural balance across the lands of the Flanaess. The Druids of the Old Faith saw a time coming when the dealings of men, and the dwindling power of the olves and dwur, would cause an imbalance of the Oerth Mother. By no means were bards of the Old Lore ever common, the requirements for entry into the Colleges and with members only chosen from the ranks of the nobility, membership was always an elite few. With the absorption of their culture by the migrating Oeridians and Suloise, the Old Faith was pushed to the fringes of society as were the Flan themselves. Just as the Flan live on today however, so too do the Bards of the Old Lore although today they are less proscriptive in who may and may not join.  In fact Flan blood is not even required at this time; simply an aptitude and a desire to spend years in study, research and memorization of Flan history, legends and genealogies. A candidate not only needs strength with martial arms but also the low cunning and agility of those who deal in back alley pursuits. Such an agent has to also possess the disposition of the natural order of things and strive for balance over law or chaos neither a champion for good nor evil. Bonus Proficiencies When you join the College of Old Lore at 3rd level, you gain proﬁciency with medium armor, shields and the spear. Fighting Style At 3rd level, you adopt a style of ﬁghting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if something in the game lets you choose again. Dueling. When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Two-Weapon Fighting. When you engage in two-weapon ﬁghting, you can add your ability modiﬁer to the damage of the second attack. Expanded Spell List As a member of this college you gain access to certain druid spells as follows. Old Lore Expanded Spells Spell Level Spells Cantrip druidcraft 1st entangle, goodberry 2nd bark skin, beast sense 3rd conjure animals, water breathing 4th blight, dominate beast 5th commune with nature, tree stride 6th heroes feast, transport via plants 7th ﬁrestorm, whirlwind 8th animal shapes, control weather 9th storm of vengeance, shape change Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

260 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Bardic Insight With arguably one of the best educations available on the Flanaess, bards of the Old Lore have great knowledge that helps fuel their insight into people and situations. Starting at 6th level, you gain proﬁciency in Perception and Stealth if you don’t already have them. If you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature, you learn the following attributes about the target: Intelligence score, Wisdom score, Deception score or any current conditions or magical effects currently affecting the target. At the DM’s option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature’s history, one of its personality traits,  or something about its ecology, if it has any. Extra Attack Trained in swordplay as much as book learning, beginning at 14th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. College of Swords

The Blades of the College of Swords is another one of the sub-classes typically found only around the Flanaess as the traveling carnival that employs these bards are a Rhenee dominated affair. The concept of a traveling carnival came to Oerth with the Rhennee people and as such it is still to this day carnivals are almost exclusively run by the Rhenn- folk. A bard of this college is a master with light sharp blades and are employed by the circuses as knife throwers and sword swallowers and jugglers.  While many Rhenee take up this dangerous and ﬂashy profession, Blades can be of any race. They can hail from anywhere but generally begin their adventuring careers somewhere near a major river system as Rhenee carnivals are exclusively found in major river ports across the Flanaess with the largest being found in Grehawk, Dyvers, Radigast City and Leukish. College of Valor

Like most of the other colleges, valour bards can be found across Oerik from the Skalds of the Suel Thillonrian barbarians to the dwur Chanters of the Crystalmists to the Gadhanevaala singers of Zahind to the Ryu Kathakara (i.e. Taletellers) of the Kozan archipelago. Valour bards inspire their compatriots through stories, epic poems and great ballads. They can come from all walks of life from the lowliest urchin who lifts up others and in so doing rises themselves to the highest nobility where they often write great histories, poems, songs and plays of their family’s greatness. College of Whispers

As generalists by nature, most of the bardic colleges can be found across the entirety of the continent of Oerik and Whisper bards are now different. This should be obvious as spies and saboteurs are always in high demand wherever the rich and powerful gather. They are found in royal courts and seedy taverns from Tian La to Rel Mord and are even celebrated in placed like the City of Greyhawk but perhaps the most widely known group of whisper bards are the renowned and feared Widows in the Baklunish city of Zeir-i-Zeif. This all-female society is made up largely of courtesans and is rumoured to actually operate out of the Sultan’s harem. Chapter Three: Character Classes 261 Cleric There are many pantheons, many gods and many faiths across Oerik.  Each major human ethnic group has at least one god and usually an entire pantheon of them. In areas where these pantheons overlap there is usually tension and war. Many of the deities worshipped on Oerth actually exist in multiple pantheons, the same god known by a different name to different peoples. Clerics come from any walk of life, and have widely differing agendas depending on the deity they serve. Generally clerics will serve a god whose alignment matches their own, and whose spheres of inﬂuence dovetail with their own interests. Thus, strict authoritarians gravitate towards St. Cuthbert; those who defend the poor take up service with Trithereon; nature lovers serve Obad-Hai or Ehlonna; residents of farming communities join Phyton, Merrika or Wenta; businessmen pledge themselves to Zilchus or Xerbo. Race and gender matters little to most religions, who are happy to accept any converts who want to join them. Clerics adventure to obtain revenue for their church; act as agents carrying out missions on its behalf; to gain converts; to ﬁght evil or good and to promote their deity’s agenda; to act as lines of communication between churches; and act as informants to keep the church up to date on what is going on in the world. Clerics are always expected to obey their deity’s strictures and dictates, and never commit any act contrary to their faith’s teachings. Most clerics worship an individual although in the Celestial Empire, it is common practice for clerics to worship the entire celestial bureaucracy as a pantheon rather than individual gods. Others follow more esoteric faiths, like that found in the The Way and these Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

262 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. have access to the same abilities and powers as clerics of a deity of pantheon (see page 18 of XGtE). Besides adventuring, clerics serve an important function at all levels of society. They provide counselling, spiritual comfort, and guidance to both rich and poor alike; they collect food, clothing, and money for poverty-stricken individuals who need it; they act as doctors and medics to all levels of society, purifying water, curing diseases, and assisting in childbirth. The wealthy have clerics to attend to them and take care of their needs and wants, but goodly priests of every ethical bent, from the strict priests of Pholtus to the independent Trithereonites, work to better the lives of the poor and unfortunate who need it. The various domains in the PHB, XGtE and TCoE all have associated gods on Oerik. The following new domains are also options and each is associated with one or more deities of an Oerik pantheon. Balance Domain

Clerics of balance keep the scales level; in life and death, good and evil, and law and chaos. They worship gods of life and death, and always have a neutral outlook on life.

Deities of this domain include Llerg, Vatun and the orc god Gruumsh. Domain Spells You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Strength Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work. Strength Domain Spells Cleric Level Spells 1st compelled duel, jump 3rd enhance ability, enlarge/reduce 5th aura of viltality, fear 7th absorb strngth, dominate beast 9th dominate person, hold monster Consecrated Armour Starting at 1st level, you eschew armour, instead wading into battle with only your chiselled physique and the powerful presence of your god to protect you. When you aren’t wearing armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Strength modiﬁer, + your Wisdom modiﬁer. You can use a shield and still gain its beneﬁt to AC. Chapter Three: Character Classes 279 My Body Is My Temple Also at 1st level, your god delivers bolts of inspiration to you while you are engaged in battle. After you successfully hit an enemy within 5ft of you with an attack, you may use your bonus action to attempt to shove or grapple them. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modiﬁer (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you ﬁnish a long rest. Additionally, you gain proﬁciency in the Intimidation skill and you use your Strength modiﬁer with this skill instead of Charisma. You gain advantage on any Intimidation roll against a target who’s strength attribute is lower than yours. Channel Divinity Unyielding Brawn Starting at 2nd level, you learn to bolster your Strength with that of your faith. You can add your Wisdom modiﬁer to your Strength modiﬁer when you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw using Strength. Channel Divinity Godly Might At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action to triple your maximum carrying capacity and maximum weight you can push, drag, or lift. This feature remains in effect until you ﬁnish a short or long rest. Divine Strike At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. Hammering Strike Starting at 17th level, the line between your mortal strength and your gods divine strength starts to become blurred. After you successfully hit a creature with a divine strike, the target, and all enemy creatures within 10ft of the target, must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, you may choose to either knock them prone or push them up to 10ft away from you with a blast of divine strength. Travel Domain Gods of travel hold power over all the ways in which the world moves. They stand as forces of change with independent and curious spirits. Deities that include travel in their portfolio often promote freedom and exploration. The clerics who revere the gods of travel are rarely at rest; they wander the world in search of tasks that may bring reverence to their patrons. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to clear a path through enemies who would stop you and your friends. Choose 5’ wide,  50’ long line originating from you.  All enemies in that line must make a Strength saving throw against your Spell DC or be pushed 10’ away from the line and fall prone.   You can maintain your concentration on this ability for up to 1 minute.  While doing so, the line travels with you and enemies cannot enter the line without a successful Strength saving throw.  Enemies ending their turn in the area of effect must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10’ away from the line and fall prone. Channel Divinity Divine Transposition Beginning at 6th level,  you can use your Channel Divinity to switch your place with another. As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 60 feet that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature.

In addition you may add 10 times your Wisdom modiﬁer (min +10) when rolling in the table. You must ﬁnish a long rest to use this feature again. Chapter Three: Character Classes 281 Druids Druids, like clerics, are found wherever the tribes of men, demi-humans, and humanoids have settled throughout Oerik. While many serve as druids of The Old Faith, others worship nature gods such as Beory and Obad-Hai (who are strongly associated with The Old Faith), as well as Altroa, Ehlonna, Phyton, Tlazoteotl, Vinar “The Green Man”, Rillifane Rallathil (wood elves), Sheela Peryroyl (halﬂings), Luthic (orcs), Baervan Wildwanderer (gnomes), and Merikka (farming communities). Druids are not often adventurers in the typical sense—ﬁghting evil and hunting for treasure. When they adventure, they usually seek to gather money for their order, but more importantly carry information between regional branches of the druidic order, settle disputes between druidic circles, oppose the actions of certain druids they consider enemies, and gather information on the progress of civilization in a wide variety of lands. Druidism on the Flanaess is almost exclusively practiced by the Flan (and Olman) although there are scatted circles of Oeridian Druids who usually show devotion toward the Oeridian agricultural gods. Beyond the Flanaess druidism is rare but not completely unheard of. These druids tend to operate individually or in small bands and no known druidic orders are known to exist beyond the Flanaess. Almost constantly on the move, druids generally have loftier goals as adventurers than to simply become as rich and famous as possible. Few urban types ever join their ranks, except those that make contact with the druids by chance or necessity. More likely, druids will come from those woodland peoples such as the citizens of the Grandwood, the Gamboge Forest, the Adri, etc. Other druids concerned with their terrains could come from the Crystalmist Mountains, the Vast Swamp, the Bright Desert, or other famous examples of highland, swamp, prairie, etc. These are rather less common, obviously, although they are more likely to adventure and become involved in the world. On the Flanaess, when druids “retire” from adventuring and begin gathering their own followers, they do not usually carve out their own territories or form schools and guilds. Rather, they will join one of several druidic orders, and may gain ranks within the society, carrying out its aims and desires across the Flanaess, or even elsewhere on Oerth. The most talented druids can rise to be the Great Druid of a region, or even the Grand Druid of tone of the orders that make up the Old Faith. Not all orders get along peacefully; Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

282 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. some are ﬁerce rivals due to opposing philosophies and opinions on matters such as civilized expansion, or something more petty, such as a rivalry between mountain-druids and marsh-druids, for example. Circle of Dreams

These druids have a link with the Feywild. They were either trained there or gained access to their powers for some reason. Their powers are mostly associated with rests, conformity and well-being, while also used to travelling through dreams or conjuration fey magic. While some olvenfolk  and tallfellow hobniz take up this circle, most are fey-touched Flan humans with the majority of Circle of reams druids being found around Celene, Highfolk and the Adri Forest. Circle of the Land

Druids of this circle associate themselves to the land they were trained in, these being the arctic, desert, coast, forest, etc. By attuning to these regions, they can learn different spells, as well as beneﬁts associated with the chosen place. Circle of the Land druids form the bulk of the Old Faith druidic order and are found the length and breadth of the Flanaess (and even beyond). Circle of the Moon

Masters of the wildshaping ability, these druids fully understand how to use the best aspects of the beast they transform into. Circle of the moon druids can wildshape into even more powerful beasts than the normally available opening to them a great world of possibilities. Circle of the Shepherd Circle of the Shepherd druids commune with the spirits of nature in a similar way the totem barbarian does. Most come from the fringes of civilized lands like among the Rovers of the Barrens or in the Coltens north of  Tenh. The primitive Flan of the Bright Desert produce druids of this sort with most having an afﬁnity for the scorpion spirit. Druids of this Circle may select from the spirits found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything or they may select from the following: Camel: The sturdy but surly camel grants you and your allies its legendary endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Constitution checks and death saving throws while in the aura. Carp: The spirit of the Carp is found almost exclusively among the few druids of the far west, most of which are Korobokkuru. All creatures of your choice within this aura will be able to jump great distances 1.5 times their normal distance. In addition all these creatures will have advantage on wisdom saving throws and ability checks. There are few druids elsewhere on Oerik with similar spirits, salmon in Geoff and marlin along the Solnor Coast. Dog: The spirit of the war dog is the symbol of the pack and its presence commands the loyalty of like creatures. When an enemy is within your spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant an ally an attack against that creature. In addition, you and your allies have Chapter Three: Character Classes 283 advantage on Charisma (Intimidate) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks while in the aura. Elk: The mighty and majestic elf grants its endurance to you and your allies. All creatures of your choice within the aura gain advantage on Constitution saving throws and are immune to being frightened. In addition the spirit grants you the ability to cast calm emotions within the aura. Fox: The wise by sly fox is a favourite spirit amongst the Flannae of Sheldomar Valley, Perrenland and the Burneal Forest. You gain advantage on intelligence saving throws and checks with the fox cunning. And you can chose one willing creature within the aura to grant them the ability to cast disguise self on themselves. Hare: The elusive and speedy Hare grants you a swift journey. Each creature of your choice within the aura increases their movement speed by 10 feet while in the aura. In addition these creatures can use their bonus action to dash. Owl: The spirit of the Owl grants its wisdom to you and your allies. While in the spirit aura you and your allies have advantage on Perception and Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws. In addition everyone within the aura that you choose has Darkvision to 60’. Panther. The panther spirit grants you and your allies’ ferocity and speed. You and allies gain a bonus on melee damage rolls equal to your Wisdom modiﬁer when within your spirit’s aura. This bonus damage is the same type as the damage being dealt. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws while in the aura. Scorpion: All creatures within the aura are resistant to poison. Additionally any creature within the aura that you choice does extra poison damage equal to half of your druid level. Squirrel: The agile and energetic Squirrel shows you where to duck and where to weave. While in this aura each creature of your choice within the aura gains advantage on dexterity saving throws and checks. Additionally these creatures also get a bonus to initiative equal to half your druid level. Wolf: Brother wolf invites you into his pack. All creatures that you chose within the aura have advantage on wisdom (perception) checks and advantage when trying to track a creature. In addition these creatures gain advantage on attack roles if any of it’s allies is within 5 feet of the target. Circle of Spores

Fungi and spores are vital for nature, and these druids ﬁnd fascination within them. Life and death are nothing but cycles that everything must go through. This is why druids from this circle have a conﬂicting view in comparison to the others regarding undeath. They believe it is just another step in the cycle, that as long as it does not provoke a danger Chapter Three: Character Classes 285 to it all, it should keep on “living”. Spire druids are extraordinarily rare in civilized lands and the majority of them are, in fact, Svirfneblin druids who are mainly found in Underoerth. Circle of Stars

Circle of Stars druids are exceedingly rare on Oerik. Some Korobokkuru of western Oerik are practitioners and there are a rare few who act as astrologers among the Old Faith of the Flanaess but beyond that they are nearly unheard of. It is believed they were once more prevalent across the Flanaess amongst the old Flan tribal nations but as the Suel and Oeridians began encroaching upon their traditional lands during the Great Migrations, Circle of Stars traditions declined as astrology centered on the worship of Celestian became the dominant form of the art. Circle of Wildfire This Circle is perhaps the rarest in Oerik having only come into being a generation ago.  Founded by an exiled, and some say insane, Great Druid of the Old Faith, this Circle tends to attract druids of a destructive bent.  Some scholars believe this Circle to be a corrupted form of druidism inﬁltrated by the cult of the Suel god Pyremius. Few even know of its existence. Circle of The Wild Hunt The call of the wild is felt by many, and to many, it means different things. Not all are drawn to seek the mysteries of the forest or protect her sacred groves. Not all are drawn to the soft, beautiful side of the natural world. For some, nature represents violence, cruelty, or dispassion. For some, there is nothing more in tune with nature than to give into your feral instincts and join the hunt. These druids leap into the fray, not bothering to take the form of animals. Instead, they relish in the chaos of the hunt, enhancing their own bodies and senses to experience the thrill of being a stalking predator with their own bodies. Bonus Proficiencies When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain proﬁciency with nets, shortbows, and longbows. You also have advantage when making Wisdom (Survival) checks while tracking a creature. Circle Spells Your dedication to the hunt infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells that empower your hunt for those that have deﬁled nature. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. Circle of the Wild Hunt  Spells Cleric Level Spells 2nd ensnaring strike, hunter’s mark 3rd darkvision, summon beast 5th conjure animal, fear 7th dominate beast, mordenkainen’s faithful hound 9th commune with nature, conjure wild hunt* Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

286 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Lord of the Hunt When you chose this circle at 2nd level, you can enhance your physical abilities. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to transform into the Lord of the Hunt. Your skins turns jet black and toughens, and your eyes glow green. Your senses sharpen, your reﬂexes quicken, your ﬁngers and teeth transform into deadly natural weapons, your feet turn into hooves and you grow a sharp set of stag antlers from your head. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Wild Shape to assume a feral form. While in this form. You gain the following beneﬁts if you aren’t wearing heavy armor: vYour speed increases by 10 feet. vYou have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. vYour unarmed strikes deal 1d6 slashing or piercing damage (your choice) on a hit. This increases to 2d4 at 6th level and 2d6 at 12th level. vWhen you make a melee weapon attack or melee spell attack, you can add you Wisdom modiﬁer to the damage roll. Pack Tactics At 6th level, you and your pack begin to work in perfect sync, each striking in tandem. Whenever you make an attack using a natural weapon of any kind, you can choose up to one allied beast or summoned creature within 30 feet of you. They can use their reaction to move up to half their movement speed towards the attacked creature and make one attack against it. Chapter Three: Character Classes 287 Primal Strike Also starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage. Pack Primacy Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking damage. Cull The Weak When you reach 14th level, you learn to exploit any sign of weakness from your target. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack or melee spell attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn. Durable Pack Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell gains 30 temporary hit points. Fighter Perhaps the most common adventurer in any region of Oerik is the trusty and doughty ﬁghter. Any sub-class from the ofﬁcial sources could ﬁnd a home on Oerik but some are best suited to speciﬁc regions; the Samurai is an obvious ﬁt with the Ryuujin Empire for example. Battle Master

The bread and butter of the ﬁghter profession on Oerik, these two sub- classes are found in every corner of the continent. From lowly bandits, to mighty knights, these two sub-classes provide the most ﬂexibility for a practitioner of martial combat. Below are recommendations for how you might build a Battle Master to reﬂect various types of warriors of Oerik. Each of these builds contains suggested ﬁghting styles, maneuvers, and feats. Celestial Legionary With nagninata in hand, you follow in the footsteps of the heroes of ages past. You rely on strict discipline and athleticism to overcome improbable odds.

Fighting Style: Archery Maneuvers: Disarming Strike, Distracting Strike, Precision Attack Feats: Fighting Initiate, Piercer, Sharpshooter Knight of the Shield / Zeifan Spahis When the cavalry is called in, that means you. You ride out to greet the northern bandit lords with the point of your weapon. As you charge, the ground trembles, and only the heaviest blows can deter you. Fighting Style: Dueling Maneuvers: Lunging Attack, Menacing Attack, Precision Attack, Pushing Attack Feats: Heavy Armor Master, Mounted Combatant, Savage Attacker Murian Gladiator You’ve fought to increase your personal glory and to entertain crowds for sport.

You’re trained to get straight into the ﬁghting, busting through enemy lines and applying tremendous pressure quickly. Those who ignore you in combat do so at their peril. Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting Maneuvers: Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack, Sweeping Attack Feats: Charger, Great Weapon Master, Heavy Armor Master Fruzti Sea Raider Dreaded along the Solnor coast from Ratik to the holds of the Sea Barons, the Frost barbarians make seasonal lightning raids all along the east coast of Oeirk where they are greatly feared.

As the Oeridians moved into the Flanaess and especially after the Great Kingdom founded of the Viceroyalty of Ferrond, most of the Flannae clans of the region were pushed into the highland as Oeridian settlers claimed the more fertile lands surrounding Lake Quag. These hardy Flan warriors maintain a ﬁerce sense of independence and are usually armed with sword and targe (a round, wooden shield) or a greatsword known as a claymore.

Fighting Style: Unarmed Fighting Maneuvers: Disarming Attack, Evasive Footwork, Grappling Strike, Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack, Riposte, Trip Attack Feats: Athlete, Durable, Grappler, Savage Attacker, Tavern Brawler Cavalier

Cavaliers tend to be from the upper classes, and so are found as much on the battleﬁeld as they are in the adventuring life. Again, mounted cavaliers can be found across Oerik from the Baklunish Spahis to Knights of the Hart or the Aerdy Knights Protector or the Unicorn Knights of Celene. While other adventurers can carve out their own power bases after building up their reputations and renown, cavaliers often come from prominent noble families and have an easy time setting up power bases, if they do not already have these before becoming adventurers. In some lands, cavalier sons will compete as adventurers for their parents’ estates, with the most wealthy and famous of them taking the family inheritance. Eldrich Knight

Mixing magic with swordplay is nothing new in most lands of Oerik and eldritch knights can be found in all lands where magic is not forbidden.  They are particularly common amongst the olvenfolk where they form the majority of the ﬁghters of that race. Psi Warrior

Psionics, the powers of the mind, is little understood by most peoples of Oerik. The speciality of focusing those mental powers into physical forms is even less known. The best example of Psi Warriors can be found amongst the disciples of the goddess Xan Yae and even more speciﬁcally, her allied demi-god, Zuoken who’s followers specialize in physical perfection and unarmed combat supplemented with psionic power. Banneret

(i.e. Purple Dragon Knight) The Purple Dragon Knight’s focus on combat leadership makes it the ideal model for several orders of knightood. Since this sub-class is named for an organization located in the Forgotten Realms, it is not known by that name on Oerik but rather by its alternative name: the Banneret. One example are those charged with protecting the lands of Bissel, Gran March, Geoff, and Keoland from Baklunish incursions, Knights of the March combine strict discipline, a near- monastic way of life, and ample study of battle tactics and strategy to remain vigilant against attack. The sub-class can be used equally well to represent Baklunish spahis and the elite warriors of the Celestial Empire or any of the Zahindish Rajis. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

292 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Rune Knight

Because of the fact that the Sheldomar Valley used to be dominated by giant nations in ancient times, this sub-class is most often found in that region. The art of giant runes is mainly practiced by the dwur of the Barrier Peaks but the tradition can also be found outside the Sheldomar, mainly in the Thillonrian Peninsula were it was imported by dwur migrants following the Twin Cataclysms. Samurai

Samurai form the elite ﬁghting forces of the nations of the far west of Oerik. Members of this sub-class are typically noble warriors of the Celestial and Ryuujin Empires but they can equally be found leading the Hochjebli of Pesh and Wunan.  This sub-class ﬁlls a similar niche in western Oerik that the Cavalier does in the east. Sohei

Sohei are religious soldiers who protect large monasteries across western Oerik, similar in many ways to the paladins of the Flanaess. Unlike monks, sohei are more militant than holy, and receive very little religious instruction. Instead they are trained in the art of ﬁghting. Sohei defend their monastery against attacks and advance its political claims in the outside world. They are subject to the leader of their temple. Like paladins, sohei think of their adventures as “quests” in the service of their religion. Like samurai, however, they are typically sent on these quests by a superior whose command is law to the sohei. Sohei are often charged with defending their temples in times of conﬂict, but they can also expect to strike against enemy temples, monks, or sorcerors, to hunt down evil monsters terrorizing the countryside, or to recover a relic that is sacred to their order. They welcome all challenges as tests of their prowess and, secondarily, their faith. Sohei, like monks, live a life of strict discipline and obedience to their orders. Sohei are almost exclusively lawful in alignment and they come from all walks of life to train in their temples and monasteries. Many join their orders as children, and become sohei when they demonstrate a strength of both body and mind that lends itself to the temple’s defense. Often, though, young men and women who show little promise for the contemplative life of the monk are the ones selected to become sohei. Chapter Three: Character Classes 293 Unarmoured Defense Beginning at 3rd level, when you are not wearing armour or using a shield, your base AC becomes 10+ Strength modiﬁer + Dexterity modiﬁer. Unarmed Attacks Also at 3rd level, your base damage for unarmed attacks is 1d4 bludgeoning. This becomes 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level. Ironskin Upon reaching 7th level, you gain resistance against all non magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Ironfist Starting at 10th level, your unarmed attacks can smash through 1 inch of wood, or 1/ 2 inch of stone per ﬁghter level. Immovable When you achieve 15th level, you gain advantage on all grapple, Strength and Strength-related skill rolls. You are also immune to being shoved, pushed, or pulled against your will. Zen By 18th level, you have learned how to still and protect your mind against those who would attack it rather than your body. You are immune to all sleep and charm effects, you have resistance against psychic damage. Monk Monks are relatively rare in eastern Oerik, with the notable exception of the sinister Scarlet Brotherhood and the scattered monasteries devoted to Xan Yae and/or Zuoken. In the west of Oerik, where they are more often known as sohei, monks are far more common with hundreds of monasteries teaching countless forms and philosophies. Most practitioners of The Way have at least one level in the monk class by tradition. A monk’s strength comes from mastery of ki, a mysterious life-force energy which suffuses the multiverse. Dedication to physical, mental and spiritual perfection empowers the monk with abilities beyond the power of normal folk. The true nature of “ki” is elusive. Some monastic orders believe it to be a non-magical internal strength, others understand it to be supernatural, and others consider the control of ki to be a fundamentally similar mental discipline to psionics. Monks typically care little for the acquisition of wealth, and rarely carry much in the way of valuables. Some particularly righteous monks take a vow of poverty which forswears the ownership of any wealth beyond the bare necessities. Individual monastic orders may have rules dictating their appearance or manner of dress. For example, both male and female monks of the Scarlet Brotherhood traditionally shave their heads, although this practice has fallen out of favour as it impedes their ability to pass undetected in foreign lands. Some wear uncommon clothing such as robes. Monks train in monasteries, where they are raised from a young age to practice Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

Monasteries vary greatly in their purpose and relationship with neighbouring settlements. Those dedicated to good- aligned philosophies often serve as protectors of the common folk, while a monastery of evil monks may rule with an iron ﬁst. Those monks who leave their monastery to become adventurers do so for a variety of reasons: personal journeys of spiritual enlightenment to test their discipline or skills; missions for the monastery which may include spying, assassination or defending the local people; outcast from their monastery for violating its rules or failing the master; or perhaps the lone survivor of a destroyed monastery. Way of the Astral Self This monastic tradition is unknown outside the Celestial Empire where it is the most populous of the monastic traditions permitted in the Empire. It is practiced widely among the bureaucracy of the Empire and many lay people follow its tenets almost like a religion although they gain no class abilities from so doing. Way of the Drunken Master

This tradition is taught from a single monastery located in a hidden alpine valley in the  nation of Behow where it was founded by a Goliath named Shokajyn almost 300 years ago. Students come from across Oerik to study this art Chapter Three: Character Classes 295 Oerik.  Variations of it can be found across hundreds of monasteries in the Celestial Empire, Behow, Sa’han, Wunan, Minyeo, Ryuujin and even the wastes of Pesh. Similar teachers can be found in Zahind and nearly all temples of Xan Yae and Zuoken teach a variation of this tradition. Way of the Pugilist

Most monks spend their time training to become as swift as possible, focusing more on the speed of their punches and few weapons they use instead of the force of them, and usually rely on dodging out of the way of enemy attacks using that same swiftness instead of taking the hit. Monks that go down the Way of the Pugilist however, see these things as secondary skills in their arsenal, seeing the use of physical strength and whatever objects that are around them as a better means of offense and defense. Pugilist monks train themselves to instead focus on becoming as physically strong as possible, using their muscular might to not only knock their opponents off their feet but also push against the attacks of their foes instead of dodging away from the blows. They also focus on the use of whatever is around them as a means of offense, being trained to use their surroundings to their advantage with great effectiveness. Whether its a punch or a chair, a Pugilist monk feels right at home throwing either one. Martial Might A Way of the Pugilist monk has honed their body to peak physical strength and been taught how to make use of any object that is around them. A Pugilist monk is trained in a special type of Martial Arts that is similar to what is taught to most monks, but has a few additions that deﬁne their style. At 3rd level, you gain the following beneﬁts: and once ready, they adopt a nomadic lifestyle for the remainder of their days. Drunken Masters are most often found in urban centers in the Celestial Empire and Zahind. The mountain dwur owner of the Filch and Flagon Tavern in the City of Greyhawk is a practitioner of the Way of the Drunken Master. Way of Four Elements This tradition came into being about 500 years ago in the Baklunish lands, originally as a reaction to the growing popularity of the Suhfeng goddess Xan Yae amongst the Baklunish. It is well known and integrated into Baklunish society and the grandmasters of its monasteries are often sought out as advisors to sheiks and sultans. Way of the Kensei

This monastic tradition is most popular in the Ryuujin Empire of western Oerik although several monasteries devoted to Zuoken in both the Baklunish lands and on the Flanaess are followers of this discipline. Many in the Scarlet Brotherhood are said to be practitioners of this art. Way of Long Death

Among the Scarlet Brotherhood, the Way of the Long Death is a secretive technique taught to those who combine the brotherhood’s expertise in unarmed ﬁghting with its preference for assassination to remove troublesome enemies. Way of the Open Hand The Way of the Open Hand is perhaps the most common monastic tradition on Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

For any Monk class feature that uses Dexterity, you can choose to use Strength instead Improvised Fighting. You have proﬁciency in Improvised weapons, and Improvised weapons count as Monk weapons for you. Furious Strike. When you make an attack that uses Strength that you are proﬁcient in, you can choose to remove the proﬁciency bonus from the attack roll and add it to the damage of the attack if it hits instead. Improviser You have become much more effective with your offensive use of your surroundings. At 6th level, you can use Improvised weapons in place of Unarmed Strikes for any monk feature that uses them. Additionally, you can choose to expend a number of ki points up to your Wisdom Modiﬁer (minimum of 1) to make your Improvised weapon attacks count as magical for a number of turns equal to the number of ki points spent. Inner Might Through focus and practice, you have learned how to manipulate your ki to strengthen you. At 11th level, you gain the following ki abilities: Giant Power. As a bonus action, you can expend 2 ki points to count as one size category larger when determining how much you can push, drag or lift.

On a fail, they are pushed 5 feet per attack that hit them in any direction. This can affect multiple creatures at once, for example if you were to hit two creatures each with an attack, they would both be pushed 5 feet away if they failed. At 17th level, you can expend a number of additional ki points up to your wisdom modiﬁer (minimum of 1) to increase the distance of one of the affected creatures by 5 feet per ki point, and this can be spread out between multiple creatures. Legendary Might. At 17th level, you have completely mastered your craft, becoming a force to be reckoned with. Flurry of Blows no longer requires ki, you deal double damage to objects and structures, and you can expend 5 ki points to add 1d6 to the damage of your Unarmed Strikes and Improvised weapons for 1 minute. Way of Shadow Way of the Shadow monks of known a feared as elusive assassins and spies in western Oerik. Many monasteries in the Ryuujin islands are of this tradition and they are often supported by one daimyo or another.  Other Way of Shadow monasteries exist in the Tyurzi and Zahind mountains and their operatives operate across most of western and southern Oerik. On the Flanaess they are nearly unknown although rumour persist that the Scarlet Brotherhood sponsors more than one such group. Way of the Shukenja Shukenja are members of a monastic order that teaches  what they consider a great mystery of the universe: that humanity is capable of a transformation into divinity through faith in, and subservience to, the Celestial Bureaucracy. They believe this perfection is the birthright of all mortals, and this belief ﬁlls them with a hopeful peace.   Many shukenja wander the Celestial Empire, serving as guides and helpers along humanity’s path. They are expected to show people how to act, how to treat each other, and how to believe, in hope that they may achieve reincarnation in a more enlightened form that will allow them to attain divinity. They never reveal their true intentions to the world, however, instead moving among the masses of humanity, offering what help and advice they can. These wandering shukenja are called michizure (“travelling companions”). Enlightened At 3rd level, you gain proﬁciency in Insight and Perception. Riddle Of Sight At 3rd level, you become skilled at attacking opponents that you cannot clearly perceive. In melee, every time you miss because of concealment (that is, any effect that prevents you from hitting the targets AC except a failed to-hit roll), you can re-roll your attack and you must use the second result.  An invisible attacker gains no advantages related to hitting you in melee. In addition, once per long rest you may spend an hour in a meditative state that grants you the same effects as the Scrying spell. Happo Zanshin At 6th level you have a preternatural awareness of danger  known as happo Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

You can no longer be surprised and have advantage on all initiative rolls. In addition, as a reaction, you may expend a ki point to impose disadvantage on an opponent’s attack roll against you. Kinesthesia To teach and live harmoniously with the ﬁve sacred elements, you ﬁrst learn to observe them in their many forms. Starting at 6th level, you can use an action to focus on your surroundings. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any creature within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, beast, undead, etc.) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proﬁciency bonus and you regain all expended uses on a long rest. Stance Of The Mountain At 11th level, you can spend a ki point to make yourself unmovable.  You automatically win an opposed Strength check when an opponent attempts to move you in any way.  No spell or other effects can force you to move.  If you become frightened, you suffer the full effect of the fear but do not run away.  You cannot move while this ability is in effect.  Root of the Mountain lasts for 1 round per level, but you can end it at any time as a bonus action. Roots Of The Mountain By 17th level your path to divinity grants you immunity to mundane attacks.  You gain invulnerability to all non-magical bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage. Way of the Sun Soul The Way of the Sun Soul borders on being its own religion in the Celestial Empire where it is very popular and where its monks serve in positions of import in the Celestial Bureaucracy. Until recently, it was not really a tradition with many adherent outside the west. With the advent of the formation of the nation of Chapter Three: Character Classes 299 Prestoria in the Tyurzi Mountains 60 years ago, a few missionaries have made the return journey from there to the Theocracy of the Pale where they have since taught a handful of disciples in this tradition which they have adapted to incorporate the dogma of the Church of Pholtus. The Way

The Way is a religion, or more of a philosophical outlook actually, with followers in the west of Oerik, mainly in the Celestial Empire and the nations adjoining it.  It’s primary monastery is located in the nation of Behow high in the Tyurzi mountains.  Adherents could be called “militantly neutral”. They preach a philosophy of balance between good and evil, between chaos and order and in their monks, between mind and body. Wayist monks usually begin their training at a young age, often as young as 4 or 5 years old. Children with psionic aptitude are sought out by Masters of the Way and trained both mentally and physically in secluded monasteries. Monks of the Way form the military arm of the religion and they are known as Kenja. Telekinetic Mind When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you’ve learned to unleash the powers of your mind. You learn the Mage Hand cantrip. You can cast it without components and the hand is invisible. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Mind Thrust Also at 3rd level, you have learned to channel your ki into destructive psychic energy. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a Mind Thrust. Select one target within 60 feet that you can see. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw against your ki save DC, taking damage of the chosen type equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. At 11th level, the damage of your mind thrust increases to three rolls of your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proﬁciency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you ﬁnish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 1 ki point to use this feature again. Tranquil Thought Starting at 6th level, you can duplicate the effects of the following spells by spending 2 ki points without needing material components: misty step, blur, detect evil and good, detect thoughts and jump. Force of Will At 11th level, you have learned how to project your psychic energy into the physical world. As an action can spend 4 ki points to cast the Bigby’s Hand spell. You can cast it without components and the hand is invisible.  Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Mental Mastery ]At 17th level, you become immune to the Charmed and Frightened conditions and gain resistance to psychic damage. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

300 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Paladin A paladin is a person guided by an oath, their force of will and devotion so strong they are granted the ability to cast spells to smite their foes. They ﬁght for justice and righteousness, with the idea of following their oath and ideals to the very end. While devotion to a deity is not required to take up the mantle of the paladin, on the Flanaess, the majority of paladins are, in fact, typically found in the service of religious orders dedicated to Heironeous, St. Cuthbert, Pelor, and Rao. Others are sworn to king or country while a few are simply oathbound to complete some quest, duty or task. Paladins tend to adventure for the same reasons as clerics; they wish to gain money for their church or knightly order and/or take up the cause of protecting the weak and ﬁghting evil. How much emphasis they place on any of these activities varies from paladin to paladin, of course. Peasant folk tend to view paladins as great and noble heroes, almost too good to be true. In lower-class urban centers or more oppressive and/or evil lands, paladins may be viewed as instruments of oppression by the elites or simply as dangerous troublemakers. In any case, paladins have their own codes of honour they must abide by. These vary from order to order, and rarely require the paladin to employ stupid or foolish tactics if such would lead to useless death. A paladin is not required to automatically charge in and attack the red dragon, but would be allowed to use the terrain to his beneﬁt and attack by surprise if a frontal attack would get him killed. Paladins are often found among the Knights of the Hart and Knights of the Watch, with those taking the Oath of the Ancients commonly serving among The Rangers of the Gnarley forest or similar orders. “Paladins of Heironeous trace their lineage back to the legendary Arnd of Tdon, who established the ﬁrst paladins of the Invincible One among the Oeridian tribes ages ago, before the Great Migrations. Some consider their order of holy warriors the ﬁrst true paladins.” Chapter Three: Character Classes 301 Oath of the Ancients Paladins who swear an oath of this kind value the good in the world, trying to reinforce it in people’s lives. Nature and light are hugely important to accomplish this, meaning they are trained to make use of them for good and maintain justice, as well as to smite evil. The vast majority of paladins of this oath serve the Faerie Kingdom of Celene with a small contingent operating out of the valley of Highfolk. Elsewhere they tend to operate individually protecting speciﬁc areas or righting wrongs as they ﬁnd them. Most are olven with humans being next most common.  Infrequently one will encounter an Oath of the Ancients tallfellow or gnome. In the west, a version of this oath exists amongst the spirit folk and yokai peoples. Oath of Conquest Oath of Conquest paladins believe hope should be extinguished from their foes’ minds and that people should be ruled with an iron ﬁst. This is survival of the ﬁttest, and should you not become strong enough, you are to be stepped on. These paladins are found throughout Oerik because the seeking of power is universal. In the east, perhaps the best example are the Fists of Hextor. While many view the Fists of Hextor simply as effective if brutal mercenaries, they are in fact templars sworn to the service of their unforgiving deity. The world is a dark and unforgiving place, or so says the Church of Hextor, wherein the strong survive by ruling the weak and forging order from the chaos. To support its dogma, the Church established this elite company of paladins and made them available for hire to those whose causes complemented the Church’s ultimate goals (and who could, naturally, afford to pay the hefty tithes necessary to maintain a crack unit of well-armed and well-trained men and women). The Fists are infamous for their efﬁcient brutality: Nowhere will an employer in need of military aid locate mercenaries more dedicated to ensuring that the rule of law prevails over the forces of anarchy and confusion. Oath of the Crown

These paladins have sworn to protect their king, grand duke, theocrat or whatever ruler governs their nation. In order to maintain justice, the law must be respected and you only should speak truth. They are natural leaders and will defend their oath and their allies at all costs. The Oath of the Crown can represent a wide variety of paladins associated with various knightly orders across the Flanaess. The Knights of the Hart are the perfect faction for this type of paladin. In addition, paladins associated with the Great Kingdom likely take this oath. In the west, the royal guard that surround Emperor Jiao are of this oath as are some of the elite forces in Ryuujin. In the Baklunish lands, some of the Sultan of Zeif’s elite Eurozary Corp swear an Oath of Crown. Oath of Devotion

Far more common within the Celestial Empire than anywhere else on Oerik, paladins of this oath make trustworthy companions ready to take an arrow for you if need be. These paladins swear to protect the weak, and slay evil, while being compassionate with those that don’t truly deserve death. On the Flanaess, many paladins who seek to emulate Rao take up this oath and Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

302 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. travel as from place to place aiding people where they can and vanquishing evil if no other solution exists. Others may devote themselves to St Cuthbert, or Pholtus, or Trithereon or Arvoreen, but in all cases they seek to do good and have a desire to make the world a better place. Oath of Glory

While individual paladins who follow and oath of glory can be found anywhere on Oerik, it is the Murians who have made the oath an entire subculture. Paladins of the oath tend to operate as solitary warriors seeking out glory on the battleﬁeld or in performing heroic deeds. In Mur, this mindset is held up as a the loftiest of Murian ideals and therefore, Mur produces an inordinate number of Oath of Glory paladins. They typically band together into companies of 12 to 36 paladins who are sponsored by rich nobles or merchant families. These companies earn glory hunting monsters in Pesh or defeating the same in the coliseums of the Murian city states. Oath of Inquisition Unswerving and righteous guardians of the law, Pholtan Inquisitors consider morality subordinate to the undying light of the One True Way. Demon and witch hunters by trade, Inquisitors believe that mercy can be weakness, and that doubt is the ﬁrst nail in the cofﬁn of failure. They possess unparalleled zeal, mixing nationalistic fervour with their conviction of the perfection of the One True Way. Pholtans acknowledge no lasting allies among other faiths, but harbour many enemies—an especially strong rivalry with the faith of St. Cuthbert has festered for centuries, as both religions appeal to the same sorts of faithful. Oath Spells You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. Oath of Inquisition Spells Cleric Level Spells 3rd colour spray, guiding bolt 5rd detect thoughts, suggestion 9th blinding smite, daylight 13th aura of purity, guardian of faith, 17th dawn, dispel evil and good Chapter Three: Character Classes 303 Bonus Cantrip. You learn the Light cantrip at 1st level and can cast it as a bonus action. Channel Divinity When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. Force Shapechange. As an action, you can force any creatures with the shapechanger subtype that can see or hear you to make a Charisma saving throw versus your spell DC. If a creature fails, you can choose to make it immediately use its shapechanging feature however you wish. In addition, those creatures who failed cannot change their form again for the next minute. Blinding Light. As an action, you can summon the blinding light of Pholtus. All enemies within 20’ must make a Constitution saving throw versus your spell DC. Those who fail are blind for the next minute. Those who fail can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns. Starting at 7th level, enemies within 10’ of you are at disadvantage on their Charisma (Deception) checks and you and allies gain a bonus to Wisdom (Insight) checks equal to your Charisma modiﬁer. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. The Will of Pholtus Starting at 15th level, you are immune to effects that allow other creatures to control your actions, such as Suggestion, Magic Jar or Domination. In addition, you ignore any effects that would reduce your maximum hit points. Convert to the Light At 20th level, you can perform a ritual that takes 10 minutes to complete. Choose a creature that was adjacent to you for the duration of the ritual to roll a Charisma saving throw against your spell DC. If it fails, its alignment is changed to lawful neutral for the next 24-hours. If you repeat this ritual for 10 days in a row, the change becomes permanent. The power can be used once per long rest. Oath of the Marshal Marshals, or White Paladins of Murlynd are the most esoteric holy warriors in all of the Oerik. They have an unquenchable curiosity for all things otherworldly and mechanical, and seek to use technology to aid the struggle against evil. They are non-conformists and trailblazers with a strong will, but also an equally strong sense of honour and justice. They usually wear a hodge-podge of strange self-crafted armor and clothing: foreign hats, odd breastplates, or shirts of chain in combination with leather breaches or pantaloons are common. White Paladins, also known as Marshals Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

Oath of the Marshal Spells Cleric Level Spells 3rd magic missile, shield 5rd shatter, heat metal 9th dispel magic, counterspell 13th fabricate, summon construct 17th animate objects, conjure volley Bonus Cantrip. You learn the Mending cantrip at 1st level and can cast it as a bonus action. Channel Divinity When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options: Grit. At 3rd level, if you are below half your maximum hit points, as a bonus action, you may grant yourself advantage on your next ranged attack action. Foreign Knowledge. As an action, you can activate any spell scroll you possess, even if that spell does not appear on your spell list or is of a higher level than you normally can cast. No Intelligence (Arcana) check is required. Deadeye At 3rd level, all of your paladin spells or and class features that normally can be used with melee weapon attacks, can now only be used with ranged attacks. Secret of the Firebrand Starting at 7th level, you may conjure a magical weapon known as a ﬁrebrand to your hand as a bonus action and you are considered proﬁcient in its use. Any feat, spell or class feature that applies to the use of crossbows can be applied to the use of your ﬁrebrand. Your ﬁrebrand has 6 charges. As an action, you can use it to make a ranged attack, expending one charge. When all charges have been used you must use an action to “reload” your ﬁrebrand by touching your holy symbol to the ﬁrebrand at which point all six charges are refreshed. Your ﬁrebrand ﬁres small, glowing metallic balls with sufﬁcient force to pierce ﬂesh and penetrate hide at great distances. Your ﬁrebrand disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. Reverse Engineering Beginning at 15th level, you have learned to unlock the formulae of magic items in your possession. By spending one hour  in a ritual you may transfer any magical enchantment from one item to your ﬁrebrand. The time it takes to transfer a magical enchantment is as Cost Damage Weight Properties Firebrand n/a 2d6 piercing 1.5 lb Loading (6), (Range 30/90) Chapter Three: Character Classes 305 Oath of Redemption

There are very few examples of creatures that are beyond saving when it comes to redemption. Peace must be set in the world and for this paladins of this oath must learn to forgive even the evildoers. With patience and wisdom, these paladins can attempt to make others ﬁnd the good in their hearts and become a true emissary of peace. Quite possibly the least common type of paladin on Oerik they are almost always solitary.  Most are found in the and around the Celestial Empire but others follow Rao and can be found in the lands of Veluna, Furyondy and the Shield Lands. Oath of Shenanigans

(Noniz only) The Divine Defenders of Garl Glittergold are not your normal righteous and stoic warriors of faith. As champions of the “Forgotten Folk”, they seek to brighten the gloomiest moments with a quip or well placed prank. When threatened with violence they remain vigilant, protecting the weak and seeking out hostile races, especially kobolds, who are their hated rivals. Divine Defenders are respected leaders among the noniz but are rarely taken seriously by the taller races which soon ﬁnd themselves the butt of the joke. They generally don ﬂashy outﬁts and tend to wear medium armor often painted in bright colours. They also tend to wear their holy symbol (a gold nugget) around their neck as opposed to on their shield but either way is accepted. These paladins try to make their community a brighter place in thought, word and deed. Oath Spells You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. follows: Common: 2 days, Uncommon: 10 days, Rare: 50 days, Very Rare: 150 days, Legendary: 365 days. There are no additional lifestyle costs due while magic is being transferred. Last Man Standing At 20th level, your grit is indomitable. So long as at least one of your allies is not paralyzed, unconscious, incapacitated or dead, you cannot be knocked unconscious, paralyzed, incapacitated or killed. If you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you drop to 1 hit point instead. So long as at least one of your allies still stands, you cannot be killed unless you take damage equal to or exceeding your max hp in a single round. Once your ﬁnal ally is unconscious, paralyzed, incapacitated or dead, you immediately  drop to 0 hp and fall unconscious. This feature can be used once. Oath of the Open Sea(UA) These paladins are unlike what most think of when they hear the word paladin. Rather than the law and order focus of many paladins, swearing and oath of the open sea is an oath to freedom and liberation. There are a scattered few existing across the face of Oerik; Leir Scogson, the Fruztii captain who discovered Fireland was a paladin with this oath. Recently, several paladins of the open sea have banded together, forming the Cerulean Navy along the coasts of the Azure Sea where the seek out and liberate slaver ships, raid coastal slave plantations in the holds of the Sea Princes and otherwise patrol the waters for piracy.

In addition you know the Prestidigitation cantrip. Channel Divinity When you take this oath at 3rd level you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. Taunt. As an action you may target any number of creatures who can see or hear you equal to your Charisma modiﬁer. Those creatures you target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, for the next minute they must use their action on their turn to attack ONLY you. Enemies can still use their move and bonus action (if any) freely. If they are not able to attack then their action is wasted as they jump up and down cursing at you. They may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect. Divine Glamour. As an action, you can call upon Garl Glittergold to aid you in the deception of your enemies. For the next minute, the targets of your spells have disadvantage on saving throws or skill checks made to overcome the effects of the spell. Prankster’s Aura At 7th level, when an enemy is within your aura attacks an ally you may use your reaction to impose disadvantage to that enemy’s attack and all further attacks that turn. Improved Prankster’s Aura At 15th level, all enemies within your paladin aura make all saving throws at disadvantage. Punchline At 20th level, you can call on the power of Garl Glittergold to cause magic to go awry. As an action you can cause your Aura of Protection to become a Wild Magic zone Any enemy who casts a spell or makes a melee attack against you using a magic weapon that are in your Aura of Protection must roll on the Wild Magic Table (PHB  page 104 ). You and your allies are unaffected by the Wild Magic zone. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you dispel it using a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you ﬁnish a long rest. Chapter Three: Character Classes 307 Oath of Vengeance Sometimes things happen that cause someone to swear vengeance against someone or a group of creatures, be it devils, demons, goblinoids, or the local crime boss. There is no mercy for the wicked and nothing is going to stop them from ﬁghting the greater evil. Those with the Oath of Vengeance are usually lone vigilantes, knight errants, or worshippers of stern gods, such as St. Cuthbert, Allitur and WeeJas, who seek to impose order by punishing wrong-doers. The church of Pholtus in The Theocracy of the Pale is served by human paladins bent on the destruction of heretics and pagans. Vengeance paladins are also not uncommon in the Shield Lands where they focus their ire on the Bandit Lords to their north. In the west, where honour is more rigidly measured and where vendetta is a common remedy to dishonour, these paladin tend to abound. Oath of The Watchers Paladins who swear an oath to protect Oerth from otherworldly beings and forces are found in few places on Oerik with a couple of exceptions. A large number of those who man the Demon Wall that protects the Celestial Empire from the wastelands of Pesh swear this oath. Beyond that The Watchers, those who devote their lives to protect against planar incursion, exist as mere rumour and legend.  One such rumour tells of a group of watchers in the far north, further north than the lands of Blackmoor, who guard against some unknown foe. Similarly, there is a legend amongst the folk of the Kron Hills that tells of an order of watchers composed of noniz (some say svirfneblin) who guard against the horrors like illithids and aboleths beneath the oerth.

Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man- eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game—even fugitives among their own people. Ranger are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skilfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal signiﬁcant harm to speciﬁc types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies. Some rangers gained their training as part of special military teams, but most learned their skills from solitary masters who accepted them as students and assistants. The rangers of a particular master may count themselves as cohorts, or they may be rivals for the status of best student and thus the rightful heir to their master’s fame. Of the organized groups, the Rangers of the Gnarley (see Group Patrons, page XX) are by far the best known but the Knights of the Hart (all branches) have elite detachments of rangers who act as scouts and skirmishers. Beastmaster

Wherever civilization ends and the wilderness begins across Oerik, there you will encounter Beast Masters, those who have an afﬁnity, and often a preference, for beasts over other humans and demi- humans. Beast Masters tend to work independently and on the fringes of society, rarely gathering in groups with one exception: in the Touv lands of Hepmonaland, the people have a natural afﬁnity for animals. Nearly all Touv have some form of pet with children given small animals to care for at a young age.  Because of this cultural trait, Beast Masters tend to be more common in Touv lands than elsewhere on Oerik. In Touv culture, animal companions and helpers are part of their society. Fey Wanderer

Found mainly in areas of Oerik where the veil between Oerth and the Feywild tends to be thin, Fey Wanderer rangers tend be connected to a speciﬁc Archfey who holds sway over a govern region.  Several are known to operate in the Dim Forest and Oytwood as well as the great Adri, the Suss and Welkwood and the Vesve. Similar types exist in the west and are most often found among the rural of spirit folk and yokai. Giantslayer

(Dwur or Noniz only) Specialized in combat against giants and oversized creatures, the Conclave of the Giantslayer is originally a path pursued by dwarfs and gnomes, in their ongoing war with a common enemy: the Giants. Using a combination of dwarven craftsmanship, gnomish inventiveness, and magic, they’ve learned how to enhance ranged weapons to channel their magic. The Giant Slayer style of combat is a careful combination of fast mobility and powerful attacks, making them, despite their size, frightening enemies. Chapter Three: Character Classes 309 Giantslayer Magic Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Giantslayer table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know. Giantslayer Spells Cleric Level Spells 3rd snare 5rd elanrge/reduce 9th haste 13th staggering smite 17th hold monster Giantslayer Riposte Also starting at 3rd level, whenever a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature. In addition, as a bonus action, Giant Defense At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against attacking giants. You gain advantage on all grapple attempts and saving throws caused by attacks made by any attacker of giant creature type. Pack Tactics At 11th level, you’ve learned to react to the actions of your allies when ﬁghting giants and giant-kin. You have advantage on a attack rolls against creatures that are  at least one size  category larger than you if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated. Tumbling Evasion Starting at 15th level, you can dodge attacks the attacks of giants by quickly tumbling out of the way. Whenever a large or huge creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn’t have advantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

Gloomstalker

Unknown to most who live on the surface world, gloomstalkers do below ground what other rangers do above. Most often dwur or noniz, these rangers are rare, but they can be quite effective. Instead of living in the surface wilderness, they are at home in the endless caverns beneath the earth. Here they hunt down and destroy the abominations and monstrosities with the relentless precision for which dwarves and gnomes are known. Dwur rangers are often known as cavers. A rare few gloomstalkers exist above ground and these operate in the most feared and remote locations like the interior of the Suss Forest, Vast Swamp or the deepest corners of the Dim Forest.

Horizon Walker

The few horizon walkers on Oerik tend to congregate around known locations of previous planar incursions with the two most common areas being the wastelands of Pesh and the ruins of Old Zarum. Horizon walkers act as the scouts and early warning resources amongst The Watchers (see Group Patrons, pg XX). Hunter

Possibly the most common type of ranger on Oerik is the Hunter. They exist in nearly all cultures from the jungles of Zahind and Sunela to the endless horizons of the Dry Steppes, hunters are the defenders of their communities against the monsters in the dark and the beasts of the wilds. Chapter Three: Character Classes 311 They exist a solitary guardians and the they also band together in great organizations like those of the Rangers of the Gnarley Forest (see Group Patrons, pg XX) almost 80% of whom are of this sub- class. There are countless other groups across all the nations of Oerik, most are goodly and act to protect the greater weal but there are some evil groups who use their stalking skills for ill. Monster Slayer

While monster hunters crop up from time to time across Oerik wherever evil exists, it is the Murians who have escalated the aptitude to a full-time profession. Outside Mur, monster slayers typically arise wherever there are monsters to be vanquished.  When a vampire establishes a new lair, for example, if the town or village is lucky, a monster slayer will arise among them, or, more likely, they will seek out and hire one to rid the region of their oppressor. The Gnarley Rangers have several platoons of monster slayers that operate in the deepest recesses of that wood. In Mur the concept of glory is ingrained into their culture and while many Murians seek glory as paladins or ﬁghters, those who are more concerned with ridding the world of the evil than they are with their own personal glory tend to be monster slayer rangers. Swarmkeeper

While hunters are the most commonly encountered ranger, the swarm keeper is the rarest. There have been reports of swarm keepers in nearly all cultures but they seem to be highly individualistic making it nearly impossible to predict with any certainty where a swarm keeper may exist. While most seem to stay far from civilized lands, others live in rural communities, often acting as both protector and using their swarms in agricultural pursuits. A few swarm keepers are connected to the feywild and are attuned to swarms of tiny fey. These are most often olven, noniz, or tallfellow hobniz in the east and spirit folk in the west. Rogue The City of Greyhawk is known as the City of Thieves for good reason. Its thieves’ guild exerts power across the Flanaess. Nestled at the center of the Flanaess’ economic network, the guild and the city it rules has a hand in almost every business deal across the region. Elsewhere other criminal networks hold sway from the Tang Gangs of the Celestial City to pirates of the Brethren of the Coast pirates of the Dramidj Ocean. Rogues are not always criminal thieves and assassins of course. Many are simply bravos and dandies; swashbucklers who seek fame and adoration while others are tomb raiders and investigators, be those of the criminal type or of more ancient mysteries. Others have more... unique skill-sets. Arcane Trickster

Uncommon at best, arcane tricksters have no real commonality amongst them. One may be an ex-apprentice to a wizard fallen on hard times or who succumbed to his greed. Another might be an orphaned waif picking pockets in Gradsul who has some natural afﬁnity for magic, much as do sorcerers.  Others may have simply spent a large amount of time studying and experimenting with magical tomes and scrolls. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

312 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. One cannot discuss arcane tricksters however without also discussing the noniz. Humour is very important to the gnomish personality. Noniz go for practical jokes, especially the sorts that are directed against larger creatures and enemies. When directed against other gnomes, these jokes tend to be friendly, with no harm intended. But against humans and other large races (including humanoids), gnomes’ humour is more of a weapon, and takes on a darker aspect. Because of this proclivity for practical jokes and their afﬁnity for magic, many noniz rogues take up this sub-class. Assassin

Assassins most often operate individually and can be found across all of Oerik, mainly in the more civilized lands. In some  places they gather together into larger groups like the Assassin’s Guild in the City of Greyhawk. At least one Mouqollad house specializes in the business of murder while assassins work along side shadow monks in the ninja clans of the Ryuujin Empire. In Zahind lands nearly all political assassination is controlled by an enigmatic group known as the Black Monkey Society. Inquisitive

Unlike most rogue, inquisitives are not typically on the wrong side of the law. Rather many can be found in the city guard or other security forces across Oerik from the elite Jade Guard of the Celestial City to Inspector Generals of Greyhawk (see Group Patrons, pg XX). Some, serve as majors domo or chief administrators for nobles, merchant houses or guilds while others, less inclined to uphold the law, ply their skills as tomb raiders and explorers of ancient ruins and of course, can be found nearly anywhere on Oerik. Mastermind

The Mastermind archetype is the perfect way to represent an ambitious member of Greyhawk’s thieves’ guild. Willing to take a personal risk on a job but more comfortable directing muscle, this ﬂavor of rogue is a great match for a character who wants to follow in the footsteps of Nerof Gasgol and rise to political and economic power. Chapter Three: Character Classes 313 Like most rogue archetypes, they can be found the length and breadth of Oerik across all cultures and races. Phantom

Rarest of all rogue archetypes on Oerik, they are only known to exist among the Rhenee river-folk of the Flanaess.  It is assumed that they alone possess the powers of the phantom rogue due to the alien nature of Rhenn-folk on Oerth. Whatever the truth, some rare Rhenee have been known to posses the phantom powers of death. Beyond these rare few, there are also whisper of certain cults, some say those exalting Nerull, others say WeeJas that produce this type of cultist. Scout

Scouts are ubiquitous across Oerik serving national, noble and temple armies in all nations. They are also the “default” roguish types of many barbarian tribes. Other scouts operate individually as bounty hunters, tirelessly pursuing their prey as far as necessary for a big pay day. Soul Knife

Those who blend the shadows with psionic power are exceedingly rare on Oerik.  Aside from some few heretical followers of Xan-Yae, the only known school for the art is run by the Black Monkey Society in the Zahind region. This criminal organization secretly seeks out children with psionic aptitudes and train them from a young age. How this secret society ﬁrst learned the art is a mystery known only to their leadership. Swashbuckler

Rakes and bravos are common throughout the cities of Oerik from the Holds of the Sea Princes to the Shi-La Isles of the Pearl Sea. A Swashbuckler can thus originate from almost any city, but among the Rhennee in particular, Swashbucklers are common. As travellers along waterways, they have learned that a quick, mobile approach to combat works best. Thief

At least as ubiquitous as ﬁghters, there is almost no civilized land on Oerik that one cannot help but run into thieves. From large cities to remote highways, there are always those out there who would relive the careless of their wealth. Thieves come Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

314 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. from all regions; all races; all cultures; all social classes. Thief-Acrobat

While the common thief is a cut-purse and pickpocket, the thief acrobat is a highly trained specialist in the art of housebreaking and feats of dexterity and acrobatics. As an adventurer, they are masters of negotiating difﬁcult terrain and situations with ﬂair and panache. Masters of athletics and gymnastics, they hone their art to a level that seems to be magical to the uninitiated. Most use these skills to gain the easy score or poorly defended hoard, but some take up the life of an adventurer as a chance to test their purely mortals skills against the world full of magic and supernatural creatures. While there may be individual thief- acrobats found in any city across Oerik, the thief-acrobats of the City of Greyhawk are renowned across the Flanaess. They consider themselves to be an elite caste within the Thieves’ Guild. Natural Gymnast When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement, you have advantage on Acronbatics checks for balance and you have proﬁciency with the grappling hook. In addition, if holding a pole, spear, pike, quarterstaff, or other pole-like object in both hands, you can add twice your reach to your ﬁnal distance moved during a long jump and the distance covered is not restricted to the thief-acrobat’s movement rate. Aerial Artistry Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to move with incredible speed, precision, and power. Few obstacles can prevent you from reaching your destination. Chapter Three: Character Classes 315 When you move, you can instead take two short movements by ﬂying. Each movement is at half your speed, and you must end each one on a creature, solid object, or ground. If you do not, you fall and your movement ends. Fearless Aerialist Starting at 9th level, you no longer take damage from falling and you no longer require a Dexterity (Acrobatics) roll to maintain your balance under normal conditions. If conditions are poor, like crossing a tightrope in a strong wind for example, you make Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks with advantage. “Normal conditions” allows ascent up a rope, beam or ledge of about a 45” angle (maximum) or descent at a slightly steeper angle, all while upright and with hands free (in general). This is accomplished by balance, muscle coordination, and superb reﬂexes. Unchained Agility Aerial Mastery Yakuza

While the Greyhawk thieves’ guild has a reputation for its power over the City and domain of Greyhawk, they pale in comparison to the reach and power of the Yakuza across western Oerik. A yakuza is many different things, depending on who is asked. He has been called a protector of the common man, thug, extortionist, rowdy, thief, mercenary, jack-of-all-trades, and even an unofﬁcial police force in places like Minyeo, Wunan and the Suhfeng Marches. They are simultaneously despised and respected, sometimes even supported by the local daimyo. On one hand, they represent the shadowy underworld, directing and controlling illegal activities. On the other hand, they provide protection for the helpless and watch over those under their care. Of course, such paternal care has a price, and it is from this that the yakuza makes his living. The family of a yakuza is not your natural family. Upon becoming a yakuza, you are adopted into a yakuza kumi or organisation of yakuzas. This arrangement is identical to a normal family clan. There is a family head (oyabun rather than daimyo), other kumi members hold honoriﬁcs like uncle, aunt, fathers, or sister. You are expected to treat these members as if they were blood relations, and indeed some of them may be related. Information Broker You are an information broker and can dig up all sorts of useful information through discreet inquiries—gain the ﬂoorplans of a residence, learn where a lord conceals a particular item, obtain the guards’ schedule at a daimyo’s palace, learn who stole a particular item, obtain the identity of a police informer, ﬁnd a shady merchant willing to buy stolen goods, etc.  At 3rd level, you become proﬁcient in Investigation, if if you are not already. In addition, to be successful, the yakuza quickly learns to master the art of dealing with others. When you select this archtype at 3rd level, you have advantage on Charisma ability checks as well as related skill checks. At 13 thlevel, your agility, speed, and flexibility allow you to escape from almost any danger. You gain the benefits of being under a Freedom of Movement spell at all times. At 17 thlevel, your Aerial Artistry feature improves. Your movement speed increases by 10 feet and when you move, you can instead take 4 short movements by flying. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

Body Art Yakuza have many traditions and observances and perhaps the best known is their use of ritual tattooing.  These tattoos are not only symbols of a yakuza’s afﬁliations and personal accomplishments but they also provide supernatural abilities. Starting at 3rd level, you gain the beneﬁts of two Common magical tattoos as detailed on page 118 of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything. These magical tattoo do not count against the number of magical items to which you may attune. Ritual Ink Your yakuza connections grant you additional magical tattoos. Starting 9th level, you gain the beneﬁts of two additional Common or Uncommon magical tattoos or one Rare magical tattoo as detailed on page 118 of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything. These magical tattoos do not count against the number of magical items to which you may attune. Indelible Power The artwork covering your body continues to expand. Starting 13th level, you gain the beneﬁts of two additional Uncommon or Rare magical tattoos and one Very Rare magical tattoos as detailed on page 118 of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything. These magical tattoos do not count against the number of magical items to which you may attune. Ink Master Your story as a master yakuza now covers nearly your entire body. Starting 17th level, you gain the beneﬁts of two additional Rare or Very Rare magical tattoos and one Legendary magical tattoo as detailed on page 118 of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything. These magical tattoos do not count against the number of magical items to which you may attune. Sorcerer Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply ﬂukes of ﬁckle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth might few mortals can imagine. Sorcery was the second major form of magic discovered by humanity (after divine magic) and it was the primary form understood by the early Suel Imperium. Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and reﬁne their mysterious a b i l i t i e s , g r a d u a l l y learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats. Chapter Three: Character Classes 317 Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters’ abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts. While some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a ﬁeld of study; it is life itself. Aberrant Mind

Aberrant Mind sorcerers are exceedingly rare on Oerik as thankfully abominations and connections to the Far realm are not numerous. Illithids and aboleth have been known to be behind aberrant minds in the past but again, these cases are rare. In the west they are somewhat more common. Clockwork Soul

Only a rare few clockwork souls exist on Oerth with all them existing in and around the Celestial Empire. Due to its inherent connection to the upper planes, it should not be surprising that residents of the plane of Mechanus have made some forays into the Prime Material there. Few sages in the Flanaess, Zahind or Hepmonaland are familiar with the clockwork plane of Mechanus. Divine Soul

Sorcerers with the spark of the divine are fairly common in the east and quite rare in the west.  Divine Souls on the Flanaess are frequently touched by gods who are more likely to show some interest in Oerth itself like the various agricultural and seasonal gods, St Cuthbert, Trithereon, Fharlanghn, Olidammara, etc.. With the prevalence of Aasimar in the Celestial Empire, it should be obvious that divine blood exists widely across the region leading to these sorcerers being familiar to most residents of the Empire. Draconic Bloodline

Sorcerers with draconic blood in the veins are rare but known to exist in most regions of Oerik with the exception of the far west. Chromatic Dragons exist in most regions of the continent but are completely absent west of the Tyurzi Mountain range where the Celestial Dragons hold sway. The reason for the geographic divide is known only to the dragons. Powerful chromatic dragons are well known to occasionally take humanoid form and even breed with humans and demi-humans, and it is from them that draconic bloodline sorcerers descend. While mist dragons have the ability to polymorph, they never engage in relations with humanoid creatures that could result in offspring. Sorcerer’s that gain their power from eastern dragons are known as Wu Jen (see Wu Jen Soul (q.v) for more information). Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

318 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Shadow Magic

Shadow Magic sorcerers have no known organizations or fraternal orders.  Most simply arise in places where the veil between Oerth and the Shadowfell is thin. Several are known to operate deep in the Dim Forest and many of the ninja clans of Ryuujin have shadow sorcerers leading them. Silent One

The order can be broken down into two distinct branches: cloistered disciples known as Anchorites of the Tower and roving adherents known as Wanderers. The former are typically wizards or lore bards who spend most of their lives steeped in study and contemplation, often guarding places of magical power or conducting research important to the order. The bulk of the order is made up of sorcerers, who by their very nature have internalized magical processes to the point at which they cannot be stolen or corrupted by the uninitiated. These Wanderers, on the other hand, are sorcerers of ancestral Suel bloodlines who actively seek out ancient magics and mysteries to protect from exploitation. They often travel in groups of three, or attach themselves to adventuring bands (since the abandoned tombs and keeps that so often capture the Silent Ones are members of a mysterious and ancient order of spellcasters based in the Sheldomar Valley of the Flanaess. They seek out lost magical lore and forever lock it from would-be abusers. In their vaunted libraries in the Silent Tower, the Silent Ones guard countless secrets regarding pre-Cataclysms history, the Great Migrations, and the evolution of magical theory from the dawn of time to the present day. Chapter Three: Character Classes 319 attention of thrill seekers also happen to hold the type of magic Silent Ones work to keep from dangerous hands and minds). The Silent Ones usually accomplish their goals through subterfuge and manipulation, but it is not unheard of for the members of the order to act swiftly, even ruthlessly. They are neither good nor evil, seeing their role as above petty morality. Their ethics tend to the lawful, though they will interpose themselves against anyone to protect their interests, taking whatever actions are deemed necessary. Silent Ones usually dress in drab cassocks, with gray and brown being most typical. They eschew armor and weapons save the simplest of implements, such as a staff or dagger. Outside the Tower of Silence, Silent Ones rarely carry dangerous spells (on scrolls or in spell books) or easily corrupted magical items, so as to better avoid their secrets falling into the hands of the uninitiated. In fact, Silent Ones believe that they do not truly “own” their magical items at all, but rather hold them in trust until they are destroyed (if evil or dangerous) or deposited in the Tower. When artifacts or other great items of magic are carried they are very well protected. Silent One  Spells You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Silent Ones Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an abjuration or a divination spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. Silent Ones Spells Sorcerer Level Spells 1st comprehend languages, detect magic 3rd dispel magic, locate object 5th dispel magic, glyph of warding 7th leomund’s secret chest, mordenkainen’s private sanctum 9th legend lore, scrying Arcane Workings Their knowledge of the workings of magical formulae allows Silent Ones to have a greater chance of success to avoid the effects of magical spells and spell- like effects.  Starting at 1st level, you can add your proﬁciency bonus to any saving throw against a spell or magical effect. Intuitive Identification Starting at 6th level, the hours of hands- on study in rooms ﬁlled with magical artiﬁce has paid off. You’ve learned a secret internalized ritual that allows you to learn the function of a given magic item simply by holding it in your hands and concentrating. Only one item may be examined at a time, and there is no material component for the attempt. Identifying a magic item in this manner counts as a standard action. The ability is otherwise identical to the identify spell. Mask of Slerotin Sometimes, a Silent One must use subterfuge to enter an enemy’s lair or escape undetected from some theft of magical artiﬁce. In these cases, members of the order turn to the lessons of the founder of their order, the last Suel Mage of Power, Slerotin. Beginning at 6th level, Silent Ones may cast disguise self at will without using a spell slot and you may Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

320 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. use the Subtle Spell metamagic feature without expending any sorcery points. Rune of Regulation Starting at 14th level, as an action, a Silent One may trace a rune upon a single magic item, nullifying all of that item’s magical abilities for a number of days equal to your proﬁciency bonus. Such runes of regulation, as they are known, are plainly visible, and may be removed at will by any member of the order as an action (this is usually done only in the hidden sanctums of the Lonely Tower). Like bestow curse, the rune of regulation cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse or wish spell. This ability does not function on artifacts or legendary items. Spell Clone Only the most experienced Silent Ones can attempt a Spell Clone. Starting at 18th level, by observing the completed casting of a spell in their presence, the Silent One attempts to determine the magical formulae used by another caster and approximate it. Upon observing a cast arcane spell and making a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 + the spell’s caster level), the Silent One may cast the observed spell upon his next action. The caster of the original spell must be within 60ft. of the Silent One at the time of the original casting. If the opportunity to cast the cloned spell is not taken on the Silent One’s next action, the spell is lost. Storm Sorcery

Like shadow sorcerers, storm sorcerers tend to arise in regions where there is frequent interaction with the elemental plane of air. This most often happens along coasts where storms are frequent but many also come from locations near the peaks of great mountains. Being ruled by a Djinni noble, Risay is known to perhaps have the highest storm sorcerer population on Oerik and on Hepmonaland one of the most feared magical orders are known as Breka’s Fangs and they consist almost exclusively of sorcerers of this type. Wild Magic

Due to their chaotic nature, wild magic sorcerers rarely come together in magic orders or guilds, instead they tend to arise in regions where great magic event have occurred in the past. The areas of most wild magical energy include the Sea of Dust and Dry Steppes but few civilized folk inhabit those areas. Most wild sorcerers simply have no idea the source of their powers. Wu Jen Soul

Wu Jen are spellcasters with mysterious powers, they command the elements, spiritual forces, and the very powers of nature. They earn their powers by attuning themselves one of the Five Celestial Dragons, nature spirits of great power from the west of Oerik. From these entities they learn their spells – magical means of controlling the invisible forces of the world. Their connection to the Celestial Dragons grants them incredible abilities to control and interact with the Five Celestial Elements. While eastern scholars, sages and wizards claim the existence of only four elements, those of earth, air, ﬁre and water, in western lands a different metaphysical view exists. Western sages, who are nearly all Wu- jen themselves, count ﬁve elements: ﬁre, air,  wood, water and metal. These ﬁve elements are each controlled by one of the Five Celestial Dragons.  In fact, according the western tradition it was proven over a Chapter Three: Character Classes 321 over a thousand years ago by the Celestial Emperor to mitigate the summoning and controlling of ﬁends in the Celestial Empire. Today the only arcane spellcasters permitted to use magic within the Celestial Empire are  those training in the Imperial College of Magic and entry is very strictly controlled by the Celestial Bureaucracy’s Ministry of Magic and Religion. Lacking access to libraries of arcane tomes and archmage teachers, most aspiring Wu-jen are seldom found living with the rest of human society. Instead, they live as hermits in the wilderness, purifying their bodies and minds to contact the various natural and supernatural powers of the world. From these elemental spirit messengers sent by the Celestial Dragons, they learn their spells—magical means to control the invisible forces of the world. Most Wu-Jen are humans, though members of all the common races of the western lands can learn their craft. Taboos To maintain your connection with the supernatural power of your Celestial Dragon, you must abide by certain taboos that might seem inconsequential to others, but are vitally important to the wu jen. If you violates one of your taboos, you cannot cast any more spells until you make an offering using incense and oils that cost 1 gold and meditate for short rest or you spend a long rest meditating. You may choose one taboo at 2nd level and one at 7th, 13th, and 19th level, an additional taboo is chosen by the player. Some example taboos include: vCannot sit down until everyone else in the room has vCannot eat meat vMay not wear shoes thousand years ago by the great scholar Thu Kin Boh that the Celestial Dragons are actually the spiritual source of each of the Five Celestial Elements. Master Boh determined Dragons of the East have no connection with the elements. Only those of “true sort”, the Celestial Dragons of Suhfeng, are born of the elements.

Hidden Masters Wu-jen crave magical power in a region of the world where few organized colleges of wizardry exist. Severe restrictions were placed on the teaching and study of magic Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

Watchful Spirit Starting at 1st level, you gain the service of a chwinga nature spirit as a familiar as though you had cast the Find Familiar spell.  A chwinga is a tiny elemental spirit that lives in plants, rocks, and rivers far from civilization. Painfully shy, chwinga prefer to move about unseen. When the chwinga drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can call forth another chwinga in a 10 minute ritual after a long rest. You chwinga can appear aesthetically however you choose but should reﬂect your Celestial Dragon.

When the chwinga is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. Innate Spellcasting. The chwinga’s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material or verbal components: At will: calm emotion, druidcraft, guidance, thornwhip (scales with warlock level). Unusual Nature. The chwinga doesn’t require air, food, or drink. When it dies, it turns into a handful of ﬂower petals, a cloud of pollen, a stone statuette resembling its former self, a tiny sphere of smooth stone, or a puddle of fresh water (your choice). Water Breathing (Water Only). The beast can breathe only underwater. Actions Natural Shelter. The chqinga magically takes shelter inside a rock, a living plant or a natural source of fresh water in its space. The chwinga can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect while inside this shelter, and the shelter doesn’t impair the chwinga’s blindsight. The chwinga can use its action to emerge from a shelter. If its shelter is destroyed, the chwinga is forced out and appears in the shelter’s space, but is otherwise unharmed. Chapter Three: Character Classes 325 Elemental Attunement Starting at 6th level, your gain resistance against damage relevant to your Celestial Dragon type. In addition, your spells of that element likewise overcome all resistances a target may have against them. Natural Dabbler At 6th level, you learn three druid spells of your choice and always have them prepared. The spells must be of 1st through 3rd level and they do not count against your number of sorcerer spells known. Nature’s Mastery Starting at 14th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. Warlock Warlocks are relatively rare in Greyhawk but not unheard of. As Iuz has ascended to power, he has begun to offer power directly to those who choose to serve him. Some of the other mysterious powers of Oerth, most notably Vecna (undying) and Tharizdun (great old one), also offer pacts to warlocks who dare contact them. In the Baklunish lands, warlocks with pacts to genie lords are almost common. In the west, many warlocks have celestial pacts unsurprisingly but it must also be noted that many of the daimyo of Ryuujin Empire are ﬁend-pact warlocks themselves. Pact of the Archfey

Warlocks with archfey patrons are not uncommon in the same regions one ﬁnds oath of the ancients paladins and fey wanderer rangers. They are also found in the cities and noble courts across Oerik as the archfey enjoy using warlocks as methods of gaining news and information of the goings on Oerth. Some archfey have even been known  to wage proxy wars through their warlocks on Oerth. In the east these warlocks tend to interact with their patrons more and their patrons may make obscure or sometimes confusing demands of them. One such place is the faerie Court of Rings, accessed somewhere within the Welkwood, and said to be a domain where avatars of the Seelie Court hunt and carouse.  (see Group Patrons, page XX) Those patrons in the west of the continent tend to be more aloof, granting their power as part of the pact and then leaving their warlock to their own devices, rarely, if ever, interacting with them again. Pact of Baba Yaga

Your patron is an elder evil force on Oerth that veers capriciously between its maternal and d e s t r u c t i v e instincts. The arch-witch, Baba Yaga is known Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

326 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. to suffocate those she holds dear with doting attention and rejects those set against her with ruthless cruelty, often times vacillating between these extremes seemingly without prompt. You have chosen a spiteful and suffocating patron, one whose nature you ﬁnd yourself more and more mimicking. Expanded Spell List Baba Yaga lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. Pact of Baba Yaga Spells Warlock Level Spells 1st bane, charm person 2nd animal messenger, crown of madness 3rd bestow curse, summon fey 4th compulsion, hallucinatory terrain 5th animate object, wrath of nature Mark of the Hag Starting at 1st level, you can ﬂick out a ﬁnger and point at another creature that you can see who is within 30 feet. A smoking, faintly glowing mark appears on the target’s forehead and the target is affected by a Hex spell cast at a level equal to your highest warlock spell slot but it does not require your concentration nor does it require the use of a spell slot. Fearsome Laughter Also starting at 1st level, you can channel your patron’s power into a powerful burst of cackling laughter. As an action, you can cause a creature within a 30 feet of you affected by your Mark of the Hag feature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Warlock spell save DC. A creature that fails their saving throw is stunned until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you ﬁnish a short or long rest. The Dancing Hut Starting at 6th level, Baba Yaga grants you the ability to create your own version of her famous hut. You can spend 10 minutes performing a ritual and call forth a small hut about 10 feet in diameter. It acts like the spell Leomund’s Tiny Hut and it ﬁts you and up to 9 other creatures of small or medium size. The dancing hut differs from the Tiny Hut spell in the following ways: v You can use an action to have the hut grow a huge set of chicken-like legs from beneath it and it becomes mobile with a movement rate of 60 feet per round. It can travel up to 30 miles overland in an 8 hour period. v The hut appears to be a wooden hut with solid walls, a thatched, conical roof and an single arched doorway. v It is not translucent from the inside as per the spell but rather the walls appear as normal shack walls.  There is a single window along the front of the hut that is opaque from outside but transparent from the interior. You can direct the movement of the hut from within it at any point as an action. v The hut can be commanded by you to move while you and your companions are inside. The hut will follow simple instructions such as “Follow this road until the ﬁrst crossroads then turn east“ or “follow this road for 10 miles, then stop to the side of the road”. It cannot handle complex directions that involve multiple twists and turns in the journey. Chapter Three: Character Classes 327 Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

328 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Respect Your Elders Starting at 10th level, you can blur the eyes and confuse the minds of your enemies, making them attack their own friends. When you are targeted by an attack or spell, you can choose an hostile creature you can see within the range of the attack and then use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, the chosen creature becomes the new target of the attack. If the attacker has disadvantage to the attack against you because of Sinister Sneer, it automatically fails the saving throw, while if it is immune to the charmed condition, it automatically succeeds. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proﬁciency bonus and you regain all expended charges after a long rest. Familiar Curse Starting at 14th level you can touch an unconscious creature and turn it into any beast with a CR of 3 or lower. That beast then acts as your familiar as if you had cast the Find Familiar spell. As your familiar the creature fears your mystical power and cannot summon the courage to do anything to defy your will. This effect ends when someone casts Remove Curse on the target or you use this feature again. If the effect ends due to a Remove Curse the creature reverts to its normal form and lives, if the effect ends due to you using this feature again the creature reverts to its normal form and dies. Pact of the Cat Lord

Said to be the ﬁrst of all the kings of cats, the Cat Lord is ruler of all cats and he bears the respect and fealty of felines from house cats to smilodons. Even hybrid beings like were-tigers and tabaxi show him great respect and deference. The Cat Lord manifests as a dark- skinned human, a pale-skinned human with black hair, a black cat, a panther, or as a hybrid of panther and human. In human form he always wears black clothing decorated with gold and gems of feline colours. He has a muscular, compact form, and his eyes are feline in whatever shape he takes. The current Cat Lord is known by the name Rexfelis. As one of the Lords of Balance (see Group Patrons, pg XX), Rexfelis often enters into warlock pacts to acquire agents in his eternal struggle to maintain the balance on Oerth. Expanded Spell List Rexfelis lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. Chapter Three: Character Classes 329 Pact of The Cat Lord Spells Warlock Level Spells 1st beast bond, feather fall 2nd pass without trace, see invisibility 3rd catnap, nondetection 4th dominate beast, freedom of movement 5th awaken, mislead Cat Lord’s Blessing Starting at 1st level you gain Darkvision with a 120 foot range and you gain proﬁciency in Perception and Stealth if you do not already have them. Feline Form Also starting at 1st level, you may shapechange into a feline form of CR 1/4 or less as an action. You may remain in this form until you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, die, or use an action to revert to your normal form. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: v Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proﬁciencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proﬁciency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them. v When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form, For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious. v You retain the beneﬁt of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. v You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. At 6th level your CR limit increases to CR 1/2 and again at 9th level to CR 1. Land on Your Feet Starting at 6th level, you suffer half damage from falling and always land on your feet as you can no longer be knocked prone. In addition, you can add you Dexterity modiﬁer to the number of feet you can jump both vertically and horizontally. Caterwaul Starting at 10th level, your patron’s gift Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

All creatures (except felines) within 30 feet must succeed on Constitution saving throw against your Spell Save DC or be stunned until the start of your next turn. Nine Lives Starting at 14th level, the Cat Lord lends you his protection. When you would normally be reduced to 0 hp, instead, you regain a number of hit dice equal to your charisma modiﬁer. You can’t use this feature again until you ﬁnish a long rest. Pact of the Celestial Unsurprisingly, the majority of the warlocks with this pact are found in the Celestial Empire of western Oerik where many work as ofﬁcials in the Celestial Bureaucracy. Celestial Pact warlocks are less common in the Baklunish lands but tend to be more common in the western lands of Risay and Komal than they are in Zeif, Ekbir, etc., likely a result of their proximity to the Celestial Empire. Pact of the Fathomless These types of warlocks are becoming more common in coastal regions especially in the Dramidj Ocean and Pearl Sea. Most warlocks who swear pacts with entities of the deeps do so for individual reasons and there is little that unites them in outlook or demeanour. Within the last century, two groups have formed that have warlocks of this pact as key members: The Brethren of the Coast in the Dramidj and the Corsair’s League in the Pearl Ocean.  While these two groups have no connection, they are similar in that they are pirate nations who are believed to be secretly led by some fathomless horror. What those entities ultimate motives are is known only to them. Pact of the Fiend

Fiend pact warlocks are the most common type being found in all known cultures and nations. About 80% have sworn pacts with the denizens of the Nine Hells while the minority serve demonic forces and nearly all of these can be found in an around either the wastelands of Pesh in western Oerik or the lands of Iuz in eastern Oerik. Chapter Three: Character Classes 331 Those warlocks with pacts with the various ﬁends of the Hells are involved in countless political machinations in lands as disparate as Great Zundal, the Great Kingdom and the Raji of Srinagar. Two locations should be highlighted in this regard however. While ﬁends involve themsleves in many schemes, in both the Ryuujin Empire and the Horned Society, they are not simply involved, the societies are shaped by those very machinations. As a result, many ﬁend-pact warlocks call these nations home. Pact of the Genie

Genie’s on Oerik swear pacts exclusively with those of Baklunish descent (exceptions by DM approval). Because of their ancestral connections with genie- kind from the time of the Twin Cataclysm, warlocks are relatively common place in Baklunish lands. As one would expect the type of genie that swears a pact with a warlock is usually impacted by the lands of the warlock’s origin.  Djinni pacts are more common in Risay than they are in Ekbir for example and Efreet pacts are more common in Zeif than they are in Tusmit or Ket. Pact of the Great Old One On Oerth, when one refers to the Great Old One, they are effectively talking about Tharizdun. Some say that Tharizdun originated in the Far Realm or in a previous universe. He was imprisoned aeons ago by the forebears of those beings known as the Great Powers, although it is said that Pelor was also involved. It’s also said that both good and evil deities worked together to ensure his imprisonment. As the Dark God, he is credited with the corruption of the Unseelie Court. Through the Scorpion Crown, he is said to have destroyed the ancient kingdom of Sulm. Tharizdun was imprisoned long ago, but his prison may weaken at times, allowing his inﬂuence to creep out into the worlds beyond. Tharizdun’s temple in the Yatils is thought to have been originally defeated with the aid of the legendary Six From Shadow company of adventurers. Tharizdun’s warlocks are often insane. The ultimate goal of most of Tharizdun’s pacts is to free the dark deity from his prison. He is rumoured to be worshipped by the Scarlet Brotherhood, though these followers are actually a splinter sect of the organization known as the Black Brotherhood or The Blackthorn. The warlocks of the elemental cults in the original Temple of Elemental Evil believed they were working with the destructive powers of the elements themselves, with a few believing their patron was Zuggtmoy; however, only a few knew that Tharizdun was the cults’ true patron. Pact of the Hexblade Hexblades are as rare on Oerik as are the sentient blades with whom they enter into pacts.  There are probably no more than a two dozen truly sentient weapons n the entire continent and therefore there are never more than this number of Hexblades at any given time. Likely the best known sentient weapons to commonly enter into pacts with warlocks are the longsword Blackrazor, the war-hammer Whelm, the trident Wave and the glaive Si-wang.

Gen A sha’ir, a warlock with a pact of the chain and a genie patron, are known across the Baklunish lands and they have a unqiue type of familiar: the Gen, an elemental companion that serves as a living evidence of the sha’ir’s connection to supernatural power and contracts. Your Gen appears as a tiny humanoid resembling the type of your genie patron although they are only 9 to 12 inches tall and have the following game statistics: Armor Class. 11 + the your proﬁciency bonus Hit Points.  13 (3d8) Speed. 30 ft., ﬂy 40 ft.

Familiar. The Gen can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master, provided that the mater is at least a 3rd-level spellcaster. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the gen senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. If its master causes it physical harm, the gazer will end its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond Actions Touch. A gen can cause elemental damage simply by touching a living creature. Hit: 1d4 + the warlock’s proﬁciency bonus. Damage type depends on your genie patron: Djinn (thunder), Efreet (ﬁre), Marid (frost), Dao (poison). This damage increases to 1d6+ bonuses as 5th level, 1d8 + bonuses at 10th level and 1d10 + bonuses at 15th level. Cantrip. You gen has a cantrip it can cast at will whether directed by you or on its own when you are not actively directing it in combat.

Warlock Pact of the Chain - New Familiar Chapter Three: Character Classes 333 New Eldritch Invocations At 2nd level, a warlock gains the Eldritch Invocation feature. The following invocations have been added as options for the warlock. Call Spell Prerequisite: Genie Patron With this invocation you can call upon your Gen familiar to fetch you a spell from the planes. As a bonus action, choose a spell from the Warlock or Sorcerer spell list you don’t already know, that has a casting time of an action, and that you have an available spell slot. For the next minute you can cast this spell using a warlock spell slot, but only once. You regain use of this feature at the end of a short or long rest. You can make a special request for your patron to pull a spell from another classes spell list. Doing so is risky however. If you use this feature to choose a spell that isn’t on the Sorcerer or Warlock spell list, you must roll a 1d20. On a 1, the gen accidentally draws the attention of an extra-planar being while retrieving the spell. A creature of a CR no higher than twice the level of the spell and of the DMs discretion appears in a random space within 30 ft of you. The creature is angered though the DM determines whether or not it is immediately hostile. The extra- planar being stays for one minute or until it drops to 0 hit point, at which point it is brought back to its original plane. Regardless of whether or not a creature is summoned, if you use this feature in this way, you cannot use it again until you ﬁnish a long rest. Shadow Fade Prerequisite: 5th level You can take the disengage or hide action as a bonus action. See the Unseen Prerequisite: 7th level You can cast see invisibility at will, without expending a spell slot. You cannot do so again until you ﬁnish a short or long rest. Wizard Wizards exist across the continent of Oerik but are far more common in the Zahind lands and the lands of the east than in the Suhfeng west. Arcane magic has been highly regulated in those lands since the time of the formation of the Celestial Empire. Wizardry is not banned outright but rather highly regulated with apprentices vying with each other through the meritocracy of the Celestial Bureaucracy for very limited positions under various instructors. In Zahind the craft of the wizard tends to be hereditary with the offspring of a wizard usually taking up their patent’s craft. In Sunela wizards learn the arts arcane at the Imperial College Arcane where most graduates are of Suel descent. Across the Flanaess, in the Baklunish lands and in Great Zundal, there are a plethora schools and academies that teach spell-craft not to mention the hundreds if not thousands of individual masters teaching apprentices individually. Arcane Traditions

The traditional arcane traditions are not limited in any way by geography or culture. Wizards with a focus in abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or transmutation can be found across Oerik and Hepmonaland. Some cultures or nations are known for specializing in Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

334 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. one tradition or another however. The transmuters of Great Zundal, for example, are renowned even beyond Hepmonaland. The noniz people are well known for their afﬁnity for illusion magic, necromancy is a popular subject in the magical academies of the Great Kingdom and the Rhenee are known for their divination. School of Bladesinging Mostly unknown outside of the Faerie Kingdom of Celene, Bladesingers are exclusively olven, mainly high olve but occasional sylvan olve take up he art. Bladesingers form an elite cadre of warrior-mages in the kingdom of Celene. Some of these agents work beyond Celene’s borders, wielding blade and magic against the queen’s enemies. The art of the blade song is unknown beyond that kingdom. School of Chronomancy Your magic has revealed to you the secrets of time itself. You have devoted your studies to better controlling and mastering time. Few are able to ﬁnd this path and fewer still succeed in it. To master this school is to understand the fabric of the universe beyond that of the realms of magic. There are no known schools or academies that teach chronomancy and chronomancers are incredibly rare on Oerik. Slow Time Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you learn to accelerate time around yourself causing the world to appear slower in comparison. When you activate this feature you can take two actions per turn instead of one but the extra action cannot be used on the Cast a Spell action. In addition you have advantage on all Dexterity saving throws. This effect lasts for 1 minute and you cannot use this feature again until you ﬁnish a long rest. Timekeeper Starting at 2nd level, you have developed an innate sense of the ﬂow of time around Chapter Three: Character Classes 335 you. You always know the time, date and year of where you are located. As an action, you can detect any distortions in time within a 60-foot radius of where you are standing. This ability is not blocked by physical obstructions, though it cannot reach past magically created barriers such as a wall of force or a tiny hut. At 6th level, the range of this ability increase to 120 feet. At 10th level, the range of this ability increase to 240 feet. At 14th level, the range of this ability increases to 1 mile. Shelter of Time Beginning at 6th level, you’ve learned how to conserve time. You now only require half the time for short or long rest. A short rest for you is only half and hour and you gain the beneﬁts of a long rest after only 4 hours. The amount of time you need to rest is reduced by half (30 mins / 4 hours). This feature stacks with other sleep-related effects and features. Time Step At 10th level, you may move by stepping out of back into the time-stream. You may cast the Dimension Door spell at will as a bonus action. Out of Time At 14th level, your connection to the time stream is so strong that you can appear to be in more than one location at a time through the use of time duplicates. You create a time duplicate of yourself that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proﬁciency bonus after which it disappears back into the time-stream. You control the time duplicate as though it were a second PC and the duplicate gets an initiative roll and a turn in combat but shares your spells slots. The duplicate has the same AC, hit points and conditions that you had at the time if its creation. You may create one duplicate at a time, creating a second immediately dispels the ﬁrst. Order of the Scribe

This obscure arcane tradition is known to few beyond the wizards who form the minority Anchorites of the Silent Ones, and the Imperial Mages of the Celestial Bureaucracy, both of whom practice this tradition. Both organizations put an emphasis on recording, and controlling access to magic. School of Onomancy

Practitioners of magic well know the power of names, but wizards who follow the tradition of Onomancy use their magic to manipulate the words that encompass existence. Onomancers expand their study into language itself, searching for threads of magical signiﬁcance that weave through names. Something that is named stands out in the multiverse, distinct from the tapestry of creation all around it. That distinction creates power that onomancers seek to tap. By speaking a target’s true name, the wizard’s spells slip between the cracks of the target’s defenses, conforming to its essential nature through the power of its name. To protect themselves, wizards who follow this tradition often hide their true names, typically by adopting monikers and pseudonyms. Bonus Proficiencies At 2nd level, you learn one language of your choice and gain proﬁciency with calligrapher’s tools. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

336 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Extract Name At 2nd level, you can magically compel a creature to divulge its true name. As a bonus action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, you discern that this magic failed, and you can’t use this feature on the target again. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you until the end of your next turn, and you mentally learn the charmed target’s name or the fact that the target lacks a name. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modiﬁer (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you ﬁnish a long rest. Fateful Naming Starting at 2nd level, you can bend magic to assist or hinder creatures through the power of their true names, and even use those names as an anchor to affect others around them. The bane and bless spells are wizard spells for you, and you add them to your spellbook. You always have them prepared, yet they don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare. You can cast either spell without expending a spell slot if you speak the true name of one target of the spell as part of casting it. You can cast the spells in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modiﬁer (a minimum of once), Chapter Three: Character Classes 337 and you regain all expended uses when you ﬁnish a long rest. Resonant Utterance At 6th level, you learn words of power called Resonants,which allow you to tailor your spells through the use of a target’s true name. Resonants Known. When you gain this feature, you learn two Resonants of your choice, which are detailed in the “Resonant Options” section. Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one resonant you know with a different one. Using a Resonant. You can use one Resonant when you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot and speak the true name of one creature targeted by the spell. Speaking the name is part of casting the spell. You can use Resonants a number of times equal to half of your wizard level (round down), and you regain all expended uses when you ﬁnish a long rest. Resonant Options. Here are your options when choosing a Resonant: Absorption. When you cast a spell that deals damage to the named target, you gain 3d6 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points you gain increases by 1d6 when you reach 10th level (4d6) and 14th level (5d6) in this class. Devastation. If the spell requires the named creature to make a saving throw, that creature has disadvantage on the ﬁrst save it makes against the spell. Dissolution. The ﬁrst time the named creature takes damage from the spell, that creature takes an extra 2d8 force damage. The extra force damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 10th level (3d8) and 14th level (4d8) in this class. Nullification. If the named target is affected by any other spells, you know what those spells are, and you can attempt to end one of your choice by succeeding on an Intelligence check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the chosen spell. Puppetry. The ﬁrst time the named creature takes damage from the spell, you can knock the creature prone or move it up to 10 feet, either directly toward you or away from you. Sympathy. If the named creature is within range of the spell, you can target the creature with the spell even if you can’t see the creature or it has total cover against the spell. Durable Magic Beginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws. Inexorable Pronouncement At 10th level, you learn two new Resonants of your choice from your Resonant Utterance feature. Relentless Naming At 14th level, you have learned how to bypass a named creature’s defenses against certain types of damage. When you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature whose true name you speak as part of casting the spell, you can cause the spell to deal force or psychic damage to the creature, instead of the spell’s normal damage type.

338 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. Sea Magic

Not a school in the traditional sense, Sea Wizards (often referred to as Sea Mages) are wizards with situational training much like war wizards. Instead of learning their magic behind a book in a dusty tower, Sea Wizards are merchants, sailors and pirates who have taken to the high seas to hone their craft. You may summon a wind gust to help guide the ship along or foretell a coming storm. Charm of the Sea The ﬁrst thing a Sea Wizard learns is to create a small charm to help him survive and thrive on the high seas. The charm can be any small worn or carried item such as a piece of driftwood or an idol. The charm grants one ability at 2nd level and an additional ability at 6th, 10th and 14th. You may change type of charm selected after a long rest. The charm bestows its protections on anyone wearing it, but loses its potency at the end of long rest if it is not restored by the Sea Wizard.

❉ Water breathing

❉ Swim Speed of 30 and 60 foot

darkvision

❉ The ability to communicate with

marine based animals using

simple gestures and sounds

❉ Advantage on Acrobatic Checks Additional Familiars When casting the Find Familiar spell you may select from the following additional creatures as familiars: Parrot, Monkey, Crab (see Appendix A) The Wind at Your Back At 6th level you may use your Intelligence modiﬁer instead of your dexterity modiﬁer for Dexterity saving throws. In addition, when you cast the spell Gust of Wind,  you can change the duration to Concentration (up to 1 hour). Evasion Beginning at 10th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s ﬁery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Man Overboard At 14th level you may, as an action, summon force bubbles around a number of visible, willing creatures other than yourself equal to your proﬁciency modiﬁer. Each force bubble has 50 hps, an AC of 8 and contains 1 hour of breathable air. This effect lasts for 1 hour, requires concentration and may not be used again until a long rest is completed. It acts similar to the spell Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere with the above exceptions. Chapter Three: Character Classes 339 War Magic

Wherever there is war, there are war mages; which is to say, war mages can be found nearly anywhere on Oerik. They are not great in number as thankfully, eternal, unending war has not been the normal state on Oerik since the time of the Demon Wars. Most nations of Oerik have at least one war mage as a key advisor if not an entire battalion of them depending on the region. In the Flanaess, every battleﬁeld worthy of the name will have a least a handful of war mages. Of all the human ethnicities of the Flanaess, it is the Oeridians who produce the largest proportion of war wizards. The demi-human races rarely take up this tradition. The Imperial College of War Mages in Tian-La produces a new class of graduates every 10 years for service on the Demon Wall.  This elite cadre of wizards are the only arcane spellcasters allowed to openly practice their craft within the Celestial Empire.

340 Backgrounds A character’s race explains what they are, a character’s class explains what they do, a character’s background explains how they lived. Fundamentally, your background gives a general description of your character’s life up to the point they started the adventuring lifestyle. You’re not just a ﬁghter, you’re a ﬁghter who lived their life sailing the high seas and plundering merchant vessels. You’re not just a wizard, you were an ascetic sage who has now returned to civilization to stave off the grave catastrophe you keep seeing in your dreams. Antiquarian

You study ancient lore and recover priceless artifacts from past civilizations and bygone ages. You preserve that which was once thought lost, and seek to uncover the forgotten stories of those who came before. Your journeys often take you to abandoned ruins far removed from the comforts of modern civilization, but there is nowhere else you’d rather be. You’ve seen some of the greatest historical wonders the world has to offer, and you may have even helped discover some of them.

Skill Proﬁciencies: History, Investigation Tool Proﬁciencies: Calligrapher’s supplies Languages: One of your choice Equipment: Calligrapher’s supplies, a tome of ancient history, a set of traveller’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Feature: It Belongs in a Museum You are a member of a respected museum, university, or other organization that preserves relics of ages past. You can gain access to the facilities where such antiquities are stored and can participate in their study. You may be allowed to accompany expeditions seeking to explore ruins or retrieve items of historical interest, if your area of expertise is relevant to the task at hand. Suggested Characteristics Because they spend large amounts of time studying the past, antiquarians tend to be quite knowledgeable, although they can sometimes be ignorant to more modern happenings. They are often excited by new discoveries, and are fascinated by exotic cultures and practices. Their social lives often leave much to be desired, as they frequently disappear for days or weeks at a time exploring lost ruins. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I quote historical texts and famous philosophers whenever they seem relevant to the situations I’m in. 2 I insist on checking every ruined fortress, abandoned town, and forgotten castle I come across. 3 I speak in a dull monotone that is more likely to put others to sleep than to entertain them. 4 I am more interested in the past than the present; as a result, I am mostly asocial. 5 Whenever I meet a new person, I try to learn about their history if at all possible 6 I freely offer my knowledge to those who wish to learn, and I encourage those I know to do so as well. 7 I enjoy going through ruins for the adventure; getting to experience lost history is just a bonus. 8 Ignorance frustrates me, and I always try to correct others when they’re wrong. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Preservation. We must protect the relics of the past, else their creators will fade from memory. (Lawful) 2 Betterment. By studying the mistakes of our elders, we might prevent the mistakes of our children. (Good) 3 Dominance. The past holds secrets I can use against those who oppose me. (Evil) 4 Trophy. The original inventors of these relics are dead; why shouldn’t I hold on to them for a while? (Chaotic) 5 Expertise. I must become the authority in my ﬁeld of study. (Any) 6 Vigil. Only by remembering the dead do we honour their accomplishments. (Lawful) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I must prevent the relics of the past from falling into the hands of thieves and looters. 2 The historical works of my race must be preserved for the enrichment of future generations. 3 I work to uncover the truth of past events, even if doing so is harmful to my nation or organization. 4 My family, clan, or guild has a rich history, and I must ensure that others are aware of its importance Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

342 5 I will perform the heroic deeds that future historians will surely write about. 6 If an artifact has been entrusted to me, I will protect it at all costs, even my life. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I have falsely claimed to have discovered a forgotten civilization and faked evidence to support it. 2 If I ever ﬁnd a relic of singular worth, I might keep it for myself…or for the merchant down the road. 3 There is an intense rivalry between myself and a particular colleague, and it often clouds my judgment. 4 I pretend to know far more than I actually do, and will often ignore any evidence that proves me wrong. 5 I care more for the money I’m paid by the museums than for the artifacts I deliver to them 6 My obsessive search for a particular object has pushed my loved ones away. Apothecary You have studied the myriad illnesses and ailments of the mortal body as well as the treatments for each. You know which herbs can soothe a fever and which oils can help prevent the pox. Not all medicine is good for the body, though: you have also learned which toxins can stop the heart or drive a man to madness. You know how to manufacture and reﬁne all of these things, and you make a living dispensing tonics and tinctures to those in need. In a pinch you can even perform minor medical procedures, although these things are better left to a proper surgeon. You may have come these spells through formal guild training in a city or through apprenticeship to a small village herbalist. ‘ Skill Proﬁciencies: Medicine, Nature Tool Proﬁciencies: Herbalism kit, poisoner’s kit Languages: One of your choice. Equipment: Herbalism kit, a merchant’s scale, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp. Feature: Experienced Eye By spending a few moments examining an herbal or alchemical substance—a vial of liquid, a packet of ground powder, or the like—you can determine whether the substance is intended to harm or heal (or neither). This examination does not reveal any speciﬁc information about the substance (such as that a powder is actually an inhaled poison, or that it paralyses its victim), only that it is either harmful or helpful to those that it is used on. Suggested Characteristics Apothecaries are deﬁned by their attention to detail. Because so many of the illnesses they treat often have similar symptoms, they are careful about the things they say and the questions they ask, always looking to gather precise and accurate information. They tend towards cleanliness and organization, as they need to keep their tools sterile and their supplies ready at all times. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I distance myself from everyone, even those I care about. 2 I keep all of my possessions meticulously clean, and I hate any kind of ﬁlth. 3 I am honest to a fault; knowing all of the information is the only way to make an accurate diagnosis. 4 I make incredibly poor jokes in an attempt to put others at ease. 5 I talk down to others when speaking on a ﬁeld I believe myself to be knowledgeable in. Chapter 4: Backgrounds 343 6 I present everything I say as a guess or estimate so that I don’t look bad if it turns out to be wrong. 7 It seems like I always try to strike up a conversation at the worst possible moment. 8 I set very high standards for myself, and expect others to follow my example. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Aid. Every sick or wounded person deserves my help, regardless of the life they lead. (Good) 2 Control. By deciding who lives and who dies, I can shape the world to my liking. (Evil) 3 Loyalty. It is my duty to treat those to whom I have sworn allegiance. (Lawful) 4 Efﬁciency. I am not emotionally invested in those I aid; to act otherwise would compromise my work. (Neutral) 5 Prevention. Stopping the spread of sickness is better than treating it. (Any) 6 Research. In order to treat patients effectively, we must understand the maladies afﬂicting them. (Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I share my discoveries with my fellow apothecaries, to further the goals of our trade. 2 I give my aid to those who protect my country and my ruler. 3 Many medicinal reagents are rare or hard to ﬁnd; those who secure them deserve respect. 4 I seek a cure to a mysterious disease that afﬂicts one of my loved ones. 5 I wish to prove that “mundane” healing is just as viable as magic. 6 I work closely with a group that aims to eliminate a particular disease from existence. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I use unproven treatments on my patients without their knowledge. 2 I refuse to give aid to those of a certain species or nationality, no matter how desperately they need it. 3 If a disease is particularly deadly, I refuse to treat it out of fear for my own health. 4 Memories of a horrible plague that I failed to cure still haunt me to this day. 5 The sight of blood makes me queasy, and I can only treat those who have no external wounds 6 I am only interested in the ailments my patients suffer from, not the people themselves. Artist You have a talent for producing works of art in a particular medium. You see yourself not as an entertainer or performer, but as a creator. You pursue your art with lofty ideals, motivated by Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

344 abstract notions such as beauty and truth. Your art is likely inspired by deep philosophical questions, and as such, you tend to have a unique insight into people and society. You may be a playwright or poet, a sculptor or painter, or a musical composer. Skill Proﬁciencies: Insight, and choose one of History, Religion or Nature. Tool Proﬁciencies: One of Calligrapher’s tools, Painter’s tools, Mason’s Tools or Musical Instrument. Languages: One of your choice. Equipment: Common clothes, a pouch with 15gp, and a set of tools associated with your craft. Artistic Medium Art is a basic human instinct, but artists generally thrive in prosperous societies that provide the luxury of pursuing abstract ideals. Choose an art form for your character to pursue, or roll on the table below. Keep in mind that some cultures may value other forms of art than the ones below, such as tapestry weaving or stained glass art. Consult with your DM to explore other options. d4 Artistic Medium 1 Painting 2 Sculpting 3 Writing (playwright/poet) 4 Musical Composition

Feature: Wealthy Patron. Most art- ists rely on the patronage of a wealthy person, someone who is eager to sup- port their unique artistic vision. You are fortunate enough to have such a patron. You produce works of art for them and in return they provide you with a mod- est stipend and accommodation when you require.  A patron will pay for the costs of production and display your art, and through them you may gain fame or renown. This relationship will come to an end if you as an artist do not produce art for your patron, or displease them with your efforts. In that case, you are free to seek out a new one. It will damage your reputation, however, if you continue to abuse the goodwill of your patrons.

Suggested Characteristics Successful artists are inspired or animated by a creative spirit, and are passionate about what they do. Regardless of their overall philosophy, they tend to be very opinionated about the ideals represented and embodied in their art, and often see themselves as romantic or tragic ﬁgures. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I am an aloof observer, always imagining those around me as subjects in my next project. 2 My head is usually in the clouds, and my dishevelled appearance attests to that. 3 I am full of profound insights and am always ready to share. However, there are always those around me who don’t appreciate my genius. 4 My thought process can be erratic and often I will blurt out allusions or loose associations, which often seem to have very little to do with the matter at hand. 5 I see into the hearts of men and women and I despair. A gloom hangs over me. Chapter 4: Backgrounds 345 6 I often speak in ﬁgurative language, and am always in search of just the right word or metaphor. 7 I question everything and everyone, and seek to examine life up close. 8 The world is a stage and life is a canvas. I ﬁnd intense joy and inspiration in almost every experience. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Beauty. Form, structure, and harmony bring light, order, and joy into the world. (Good) 2 Truth. A great artist shows the truth in all things, even if it is difﬁcult. (Neutral) 3 Subversion. Great art is that which employs satire and wit to subtly lay bare the failings and foibles of the powerful. (Chaotic) 4 Devotion. Art is sacred and should be used to honour the gods, ancestors and tradition. (Lawful) 5 Nihilism. The only truth is that there is no truth. Nothing is sacred. Dissonance and grotesquery are beautiful in their own way. (Evil) 6 Creativity. The creative spirit is divine, and artistic expression is the highest calling. (Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I am destined to create the world’s greatest masterpiece. 2 I am willing to die for my ideals. 3 I have a duty to protect works of art, thus protecting the essence of civilization. 4 My work was plagiarized. I must set the record straight and get the credit I deserve. 5 I idolize one of the great masters. 6 I am devoted to perfecting an uncompleted work. Flaws d8 Flaw 1 Alcohol allows my creative spirit to ﬂow and as such I am rarely sober. 2 I talk to myself, or the voices in my head. I’m not crazy, but people think I am. 3 I speak freely—perhaps too freely. I really don’t care who I offend. 4 I am my own greatest critic, a perfectionist and full of doubts. As such, I rarely see any project through to the end. 5 I sometimes let bad things happen just so I can see the how the drama will unfold. 6 I am far too eager to worship at the feet of beautiful or heroic people. 7 I have a bitter rival. Both of us will stop at nothing to see the other humiliated. 8 I’m obsessive. Once I start something, I cannot stop until it is done.

Athlete You strive to perfect yourself physically and in execution of everything you do. The thrill of competition in the arena lights ﬁre in your blood, and the roar of the crowd drives you forward. Tales of your exploits precede you and might open doors or loosen tongues. Whether in one of the city-states, between them, or among the non-human creatures of Pesh, physical contests and those who pursue them command respect bordering on reverence. Athletes arise from all walks of life and all cultures and quite often cross paths with one another.

Favored Event Table d8 Favored Event 1 Sprint / Hurdles 2 Long-distance running 3 Wrestling 4 Boxing 5 Chariot or horse race 6 Pankration 7 Javelin / Discus 8 Pentathlon (running, long jump, discus, javelin, wrestling) Chapter 4: Backgrounds 347 Feature: Athletic Charm Due to your constant training and exercise, your body appears to be in peak performance to any average person, even if it isn’t. People will be ﬂustered to have your attention because your body is as close to a physical ideal as it could possibly get to these people. In other words people will try to accommodate your wishes and needs due to a sort of awestruck intimidation that they get from you. Suggested Characteristics A athlete is one of the common people, for better or for worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities remain very important to them.

The strongest bonds are forged through struggle. (Good) 4 People. I strive to inspire my spectators. (Neutral) 5 Tradition. Every game has rules, and the playing ﬁeld must be level. (Lawful) 6 Growth. Lessons hide in victory and defeat. (Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 My teammates are my family. 2 I will overcome a rival and prove myself their better. 3 My mistake got someone hurt. I’ll never make that mistake again. 4 I will be the best for the honor and glory of my home. 5 The person who trained me is the most important person in my world. 6 I strive to live up to a speciﬁc hero’s example. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I indulge in a habit that threatens my reputation or my health. 2 I’ll do absolutely anything to win. 3 I ignore anyone who doesn’t compete and anyone who loses to me. 4 I have lingering pain from old injuries. 5 Any defeat or failure on my part is because my opponent cheated. 6 I must be the captain of any group I join. Bandit (reformed) You lived in the shadows, raiding homesteads, shepherds and travellers in the dead of night. You didnt care if it was jelwellery of livestock, you took whatever had value and could be changed into coin.

You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; speciﬁcally, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you. Suggested Characteristics Bandits and thugs may seem like they don’t care at all for others but they have personal lives too, and bonds. Though these tend to side with one view of morality and rarely another. there is more under the surface than a cut-throat highway robber. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I am constantly observing every corner of my surroundings, especially when in unfamiliar territory. 2 I never settle for an unfair price and I am willing to haggle for hours. 3 I never panic, even when outnumbered in a ﬁght. 4 I’ve never been caught, which makes me cocky. 5 I often act on my instincts 6 I have little patience when forced to work with others. 7 If I cannot see someone, I assume they are trying to attack me from behind. 8 I cannot sleep without having a weapon nearby. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Charity. I never steal from people who cannot afford it. (Good) 2 Domination. People should protect what they own, they deserve to be stolen from. (Evil) 3 Solitude.

Chapter 4: Backgrounds 349 Bureaucrat Great cities and empires are run behind the scenes by a class of literate people who manage the important details of daily affairs. These are the administrators, the treasurers, record keepers, tax collectors, scribes, judges, advocates, engineers, diplomats and advisors. As a member of one of these professions, you are a politician without the privileges of noble birth and you probably have not led what would be called an exciting or dangerous life. Ink stains, not blood stains, have been your greatest worry. There is very little glory in being a bureaucrat. You may be honest, diligent, and hard- working, or perhaps devious, manipulative and self-serving. Either way, you possess a practical intelligence and have a keen insight into the inner workings and logistics of large organizations, and you may have had access to sensitive information.

Cultist (reformed) Once, you were an obedient member of an evil religious cult. You may have been a follower of a dark god, demon prince, twisted fey, or just power-hungry religious fanatic—that is of little importance now. What matters now is that, somehow, you found it in you to free yourself from the blind servitude and saw the error of your ways. Many innocents died by your hand— sacriﬁced on an altar or slain in raids. Brainwashed, drugged, or simply confused and misled you have committed crimes so heinous you could hardly ever ask for forgiveness. Nevertheless, you have left the cult determined to seek a new life. Will it be a life of virtue in a pursuit of redemption or a lonesome journey of an embittered and broken individual trying Chapter 4: Backgrounds 355 to run away from their past? Why did you join the cult in the ﬁrst place? What made you see through the veil of the cult indoctrination? How have you managed to escape?

All cults are essentially the same and their members exhibit the same behavioural patterns. By extension, you can also easily recognize any drug addicts, compulsive liars and people with various behavioural disorders. Suggested Characteristics A rejection of socially-accepted belief or behaviour, and adherence to strict and potentially isolating set of rules, deﬁned your life. You will live with the crimes and atrocities you’ve committed for the rest of your life. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 Everything is a sign of coming doom. Every. Single. Thing. 2 The world outside is so exciting! Now I can do everything the dark lord forbid, like drinking wine, or wearing shoes! 3 If I’m not stopped, I will openly reminisce about my old days in the cult all day long. 4 I can’t help but check my cult’s holy scriptures for advice about any given situation. 5 I still can’t help but check the holy scriptures for advice about any given situation. 6 It’s no big deal; it’s not the end of the world. That’s not for another ﬁve years, three months, ten days, twelve hours... 7 I hate my cult for what they made me do and what they made me become. 8 The dark lord used to order us to do everything, and it’s a little hard for me to live without that structure.

Flaws d6 Flaw 1 If I ever had the chance, I’d deﬁnitely rejoin my cult. 2 I’m a little too into blood sacriﬁce. 3 Knowledge is more important than sanity. 4 I’m often more interested in than frightened of abominable eldritch monsters. 5 I’m too willing to follow orders without thinking. 6 Murder was signiﬁcantly less frowned upon by the cult than it is in the outside world.

Hobniz Keeper

You are a current or former Arvoreen Keeper. Also known as Keepers of the Vigilant Guardian, they are primarily composed of halﬂings that crave action. They are the defenders of their communities. They believe in an active defense, much like their patron god, Arvoreen the Defender, who promises them a glorious afterlife at his side. Consequently, keepers aggressively prepare for incursions into halﬂing lands and are always ready to repulse hostile invaders at the ﬁrst sign of trouble. They construct defensive barriers, signaling systems, beacons, and traps to protect their charges. They patrol the community and surrounding areas, driving away or Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

362 killing monsters and intruders. They also keep the peace and lead village militias when invaders attack. A few keepers choose to wander, becoming deputy- rangers or road sheriffs—law ofﬁcers given authority by local ofﬁcials to wander afar in search of those who commit crimes against halﬂing communities. They follow a code of ethics, but understand that it is only a set of guidelines that cannot cover every situation. Keepers might make questionable alliances, even steal at times, if such extremes are required to defend their charges. Similarly, they might ignore a petty theft if no one was injured. In times of war, Arvoreen’s keepers are commanders of halﬂing soldiers, elite warriors, and scouts. In times of peace, they are sentinels and troubleshooters, often serving as local constables, sheriffs, wardens, magistrates, or marshals, being politely nosy, maintaining order, and enforcing the law. However, even when they do not hold these positions, the local sheriff and halﬂing clergy know they can always call on keepers for assistance.

Chapter 4: Backgrounds 371 Mouqolod Factor Merchants of the Mouqolod Consortium can be found roaming the Baklunish near west and beyond, often as far away as The Great Kingdom in the east and the Celestial Empire in the west. From the crowded marketplaces of massive cities, to caravans wending through the Bramblewood or across the Dry Steppes, to isolated settlements, villages, and trading posts scattered in the deepest wilderness. Mouqolod factors represent the Mouqolod in all trade relations and in so doing, study the traditions, needs, and exports of cultures from across the land giving them a broad view of the world. You have worked for the Mouqolod and have learned the ins and outs of commerce in a way few people understand. This knowledge can prove invaluable for those who pursue the adventuring life. Skill Proﬁciencies: Choose two of: Deception History, Insight, or Persuasion Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A set of artisan’s tools of your choice or a musical instrument of your choice, a magnifying glass, merchant scales, a set of traveller’s clothes, a wooden holy symbol of Mouqol, and a pouch containing 30 gp Mercantile Role Most of the time, roles in a Mouqolod organization are rigidly deﬁned, with the Factor hiring help to fulﬁl the various jobs required to keep a caravan, shio or business functioning. Sometimes, in small or privately run ventures, these roles may bleed together with one or members performing multiple roles or trading off. You may choose one of these primary roles to represent what your character did for the Mouqolod, or determine it randomly by rolling on the table below. d6 Mercantile Role 1 Small business 2 Security 3 Diplomat 4 Animal Wrangler 5 Accounting and Finance 6 Clandestine acquisitions specialist Feature: Supply Chain From your time as a merchant, you retain connections with wholesalers, suppliers, and other merchants and entrepreneurs. You can call upon these connections when looking for items or information. Suggested Characteristics Being a Mouqollod factor means having a head for numbers, a strong personality, the ability to make deals with hostile adversaries, a strong sword arm to ﬁght off bandits, and the intuition for knowing what people want and need. The art of business is the art of ﬁnding the best path to proﬁt, and that path might be different with each transaction. It takes a strong mind and a stronger stomach to succeed.

Everywhere I go, I’m surrounded by rivals. Old Faith Initiate The Old Faith is still widely practiced in the Flanaess, and not only in those regions dominated by descendants of the Flan peoples. The age-old sacred groves and monolithic circles of the Old Faith may include shrines dedicated to any nature deity the resident druids permit, but most often they are unadorned. While druids ﬁll the role of priests, lay clergy known as Initiates provide most of the day to day needs of any given Old Faith community,  They are selected as children for their connection with nature and are usually expected to become druids themselves. The Old Faith holds itself aloof from worldly affairs, being primarily concerned with the cycles of nature: life, death, and rebirth. They view all things as part of a great cycle, with Good and Evil only temporary phases. Only when the cycle itself is threatened do they feel called to action. Initiate oversea the daily rituals and educational needs of an Old Faith community while Ovates oversea the monthly and seasonal rites and preside over naming, marriage and funerary rites. Initiates are often sought for their knowledge of crops, and nature in general. Skill Proﬁciencies: Nature, Religion Tool Proﬁciencies: One type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument Languages: Elvish or sylvan Equipment: An Old Faith insignia, a healer’s kit, robes, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp. Feature: Shelter The Faithful As lay clergy of the Old Faith, you can count on any Old Faith community anywhere to provide shelter and aid. You and your companions can ﬁnd a place to hide or rest in any community that has an Old Faith congregation, unless you Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

In addition, as a Old Faith ovate you can receive free healing and care at any Old Faith shrine, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Suggested Characteristics Ovates are true believers—being a lay minister of the faith allows little room for the cynical or disillusioned. They are spiritual, empathetic, and generally peaceful—unless roused to action. Their ﬂaws and bonds alike grow naturally from their close ties to their community. Chapter 4: Backgrounds 375 Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I never raise my voice or lose my temper. 2 It is my honour to serve my community. 3 I am deligent in my duties as ovate and will stop whatever I am doing to meet the relgious needs of my faith (daily prayer, etc.). 4 I’m always straining to peer into another reality that seems to be just beyond my senses. 5 I’m uneasy if I can’t see plants growing or feel soil beneath my feet. 6 Seeing illness or injury in any creature saddens me. 7 I have much to be proud of, but I am still just one strand in the grand, interwoven tapestry of life. 8 Nature offers rich and abundant metaphors for understanding the complexities of life. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Community. My village is all that really matters. (Any) 2 Harmony. Nothing is more beautiful than voices and actions aligned in common purpose. (Good) 3 Order. Like a well-pruned tree, society thrives when everything is kept in good order. (Lawful) 4 Life. Preserving life and nature is always a worthwhile endeavor. (Good) 5 Humility. Ambition and pride are the roots of strife. (Good) 6 Evangelism. When all have found the peace of the Old Faith on Oerth, then all will ﬁnally know peace. (Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I would give my life in the defense of my community and congregation. 2 I love beasts and plants of all kinds, and am loath to harm them. 3 A druid nursed me to recovery from a mortal illness. 4 I’ll sing the blessings of Beory with my dying breath. 5 I cherish a leaf from deep within the forest that changes color with the seasons, even though it is no longer attached to the tree. 6 Every member of the community is my kin, and I would ﬁght for any one of them. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I’m terriﬁed of getting into a ﬁght where my side is outnumbered. 2 I assume that people mean well until they prove otherwise. 3 I enjoy comfort and quiet, and prefer to avoid extra effort. 4 I have a ﬁerce temper that doesn’t reﬂect the inner calm I seek. 5 I’m convinced that everyone else in my community has a deeper connection to Old Faith than I do. 6 I’m trying to atone for the life of crime I led before I joined the Old Faith, but I ﬁnd it hard to give up my bad habits. Slave (escaped) You were born into a life of enforced servitude. As a slave you may have been exchanged between masters for years or spent your entire life as the property of one person, family or organization. Toiling for another, obeying orders, and debasing yourself have been your way of life. However, you have escaped this life of servitude and now have your freedom whether that was granted by your master or obtained through escape. Your background as a slave has given you the patience to suffer the vagaries of powerful people and also insight into the dynamics of power, its uses and abuses. Skill Proﬁciencies: Insight plus two of: deception, performance, persuasion, or survival Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

376 Tool Proﬁciencies: Choose one of the following: cook’s utensils, carpenter’s tools, weaver’s tools, or cobbler’s tools Languages: Choose either one language to represent either the language of your master or your language of birth. Equipment: a set of worn and ragged common clothes, a trinket from your childhood, a pouch containing 5g. Feature: Solidarity You have an unspoken kinship with all people who live in servitude, a shared understanding of what it means to serve a master, as you once did. Speaking socially coded language, you can gain the trust of other servants, ﬁnd welcome in their company, shelter in their midst, and sometimes even gaining access to places of power through the back doors. Speaking with other slaves and servants you can easily glean from them rumours and information regarding their masters. Suggested Characteristics The greater part of a slave’s life has revolved around the wants and needs of another person and they are not used to caring too much about themselves, except for how they will make it to the next day. Their new-found freedom offers broader horizons, which can be exhilarating, challenging or even terrifying Serving a master for many years tends to make slaves cautious, patient, self effacing and observant. Many have waited years upon years for the chance to break free from their bondage. As such, these (ex)slaves tend to value freedom as the highest ideal. On the other hand, there are those who feel it is part of the natural order of life that some are slaves and some are masters. Chapter 4: Backgrounds 377 Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I hide my disdain for others through a blank mask I have mastered over the years. 2 I stole what books and poems I could during my service, they’re what kept me sane. 3 I now spend my life to the fullest after spending most of it in service of others. 4 Everyone should be equal, regardless of social status. 5 I often spent hours standing still and frequently ﬁnd myself returning to this when idle. 6 I shall never be used by another again, I expect equal treatment and pay for services rendered. 7 I refuse to become a victim, and hate those who seek to bring others down. 8 I often make up stories of a better past and choose to spread those around as opposed to the truth. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 I know the pains of servitude and refuse to let anyone else go through it. (Good) 2 I will go to any length to destroy those who locked me away. (chaotic) 3 I am no longer bound to anyone and I will enjoy my freedom. (chaotic) 4 I wish to bring those who seek to wrong others to justice. (lawful) 5 I do what is necessary in order to bring hope to others. (good) 6 I will make others bow to me as I was once made to bow. (Evil) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I was not the only slave. I want to free those who I left behind. 2 My family did their best to protect me, I want to do the same for them. 3 One of those who worked for my master freed me, I wish to repay that debt. 4 I was deemed useless and left to die. I wish to live and prove them wrong. 5 There’s a rage inside against those who held me captive, I want vengeance against them. 6 Many tried to escape, few did. I wish to honour their memories by living the best life. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I am no longer a slave and I refuse to bow to anyone be they king or commoner. 2 I trust no one. 3 I will never allow myself to be taken captive again, no matter the cost. 4 I tend to freeze when faced with scrutiny after years of abuse. 5 I work to forget my past, often drinking to the point of oblivion. 6 I am unused to making my own decisions and will often refer to others to make a decision.

378 Thieves Guild Member The Greyhawk Thieves’ Guild has become part of the myths and legends of the Flanaess. It has become, in the many tales that are told around camp-ﬁres and in taverns across the continent, the very epitome of stealth, cunning and thievery. The reputation of the city itself as a den of thieves has spread far and wide over the course of the city’s history, and travellers will be warned off by innkeepers and tavern-keepers many hundreds of miles away with terrible stories of the guild’s ruthlessness, and the thieves’ amazing, almost supernatural, ability to part you from your riches. Actually thievery, although an important part of the guild’s activities, is not as common as many people would imagine. The Thieves’ Guild prefers to rob outsiders, be they merchants or adventurers, and leave the locals (especially those who belong to the more powerful or inﬂuential of the city’s guilds) alone. There are strict quotas imposed by the guild’s leaders on exactly how much can be stolen from the Merchants’ and Traders’ Union in any month, for example, and the possessions of any member of the Wizardry are generally considered inviolate (for good reason!) However, non-union traders are fair game, and adventurers offer rich pickings. The lowest, street level thugs of the Guild have been vouched for by a member and committed an assigned crime as initiation. Enforcers have been with the guild longer, hold true to the beliefs and goals of the guild and are often found with several thugs working beneath them. A group of thugs and enforcers form a gang and their leader is known as a kapo, a low-ranking leader, who have to bring in their weekly quotas or else.  Lording over several kapos is the Shadow Clerk, a mid-level leader, who answers to a chapter leader. Each quarter of the city is a separate chapter of the guild and lorded over by a Shadow Steward. Membership in a quarter is permanent unless Shadow Stewards decide otherwise, although members will occasionally be temporarily transferred for a joint operation. The Guild’s activities are many and varied, but in almost all cases, have a materialistic bent. They seek to amass wealth, and that can mean seeking dirt on enemies, ﬁnding new trade routes or deposits of ore and treasure, and so on. Skill Proﬁciencies: Two of your choice from: Stealth, Deception, Sleight of Hand Chapter 4: Backgrounds 379 Tool Proﬁciencies: Two of your choice from: Disguise Kit, Poisoners Kit, Forgery Kit, Thieves’ Tools Languages: Thieves Cant, or if you already know Thieves Cant, you become proﬁcient in any language of your choosing. Equipment: Your choice from: a poisoners kit, a disguise kit, forgery kit or thieves’ tools; a set of common clothes, and a small pouch with 5gp. Feature: Shadow Thief Like an artisan you belong to a guild but instead of merchants you consort with criminals. You live a comfortable lifestyle without charge, and the guild will grant you protection from any crimes you are charged with. To remain part of the guild you must pay them a tithe of 10gp per month. In addition the guild provides for the upkeep of your weapons and your living costs (food) while away from the guild. Suggested Characteristics Guild members are loyal to each other while at the same time constantly maneuvering against each other for advanacement and choice jobs. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I assume every job is a trap. 2 I tend to approach conversation with people I’ve just met as though it were an interrogation. 3 I don’t like killing. 4 I always check the escape routes of every building I enter. 5 I have trouble trusting people, especially those closest to me. 6 I have a habit of listening in on the conversations of others. 7 I prefer not to talk unless it’s necessary. 8 I’m a specialist and my skills are best used in a team atmosphere. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Charity: I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good) 2 Brutality: Gold pales to the brilliance of the life draining from their eyes. (Evil) 3 Honour: I don’t steal from others in the trade. (Lawful) 4 Greed: Everything, and everyone, has a price. (Chaotic) 5 People: The Guild is your family and when you are there for it, it will watch out for you. (Neutral) 6 Self-Knowledge: Take your destiny in your own hands and never be less than what you deserve to be. (Any) Bonds d6 Bond 1 I owe my guild a great debt for forging me into the person I am today. 2 One day I will return to my guild and prove that I am the greatest shadow thief of them all. 3 I’m trying to pay off an old debt I owe to My Teacher. 4 I am almost dangerously greedy. 5 I need to be the most famous thief alive. 6 I know I’ve done my best work when nobody knows I’ve done anything at all. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 I have no problem with betraying people who trust me. 2 I keep everything. 3 Not only am I good at what I do, but I love what I do - and I hate myself for it. 4 I never share secrets with anyone. 5 I don’t save people who can’t save themselves. The Game is harsh and the stupid and ﬂamboyant tend to die the ﬁrst. 6 Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

380 Tribal

You come from a primitive tribe that has had no interaction with ‘modern’ civilization. Nearly everything is new to you. Things that everyone else takes for granted are fascinating to you at least at ﬁrst. You ask dumb questions though sometimes these questions are actually very smart because you ask about things that no one else questions. You generally do things the wrong way (for example putting on armor) until someone shows you how to do them. However you are also attuned to things of nature that other people don’t notice. This background can represent a  variety of tribal peoples across Oerik from the Olman and Suel of the Amedio  to some of the northwestern Touv tribes,  Mulwari hill tribes, Flan rovers of the barrens or Korobokurru clans in Wuhan. Skill Proﬁciencies: Two of: Athletics, Nature or Survival Tool Proﬁciencies: One type of musical instrument or artisan’s tools Languages: Any one of your choice Equipment: A hunting trap, a totemic token or set of tattoos marking your loyalty to your tribe and your tribal totem, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp d6 Specialization 1 Hunter 2 Gatherer 3 Warrior 4 Fisher 5 Tool Maker 6 Story Teller Feature: Primitive Heritage You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe’s territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the wider region. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you can ﬁnd twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there. Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of your people, and those allied with your tribe, often including members of the druid circles, tribes of nomadic elves, followers of the Old Faith, depending on your home region. Suggested Characteristics Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will never despoil nature and you honour your tribe. Personality Traits d6 Personality Trait 1 Centered - My upbringing in nature and love has allowed me to feel calm and collected in almost any situation. It is clear that city upbringing makes people slightly insane. 2 Innocent - I see the world as I saw it while living in my tribe, a place of safety, friendship, and truthfulness. I am trusting, no matter what other people say about the world. 3 Inquisitive - I want to know about everything and experience everything. I ask many questions and get involved in many situations. 4 Bold - These civilized people are soft. They are wimps and I act with great boldness compared to their cowardly manner. 5 Wise - I have wisdom and perspective beyond my years because I can see society with an uncivilized objectivity. I have +1 to insight. 6 Truthful - I am not used to a society full of lies and deceit as compared to my much more truthful tribal society. By habit I tend to tell the truth. Chapter 4: Backgrounds 381 Ideals d6 Ideal 1 Nature. you are troubled by the sterility and disconnectedness from nature of cities, villages, and dungeons and you want to return the people of civilization to a state of harmony with nature.

You want to foster harmony among opponents as much as possible (some combination of good, neutral, or lawful) 3 Simplicity. you are troubled by the complexity of the modern world and realize that the simplicity of your tribe has great value. You want to return to them someday. (any non-lawful alignment) 4 Modernity. you are impressed by what the modern world has discovered, and wish to learn everything that the modern world knows.

(any non-chaotic alignment) Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

382 Bonds d6 Bond 1 Old Tribe. You are bonded to your ancestral tribe and will do things the way your tribe does them. Your tribe had a particular set of mores and morals, and you will naturally adhere to these. This does not make you lawful, just sentimental. 2 New Tribe. The group of people you are with becomes your new tribe. You treat them as tribe members, mourning the loss of any of them, trying to keep in touch with any that retire or leave etc. You insist that dead members be treated properly. 3 Revenge. You were dragged away from your primitive tribe by slavers intent on selling you. You were grievously mistreated and and you are determined to get revenge on these slavers. 4 Restoration.

I have forgiven someone for some wrong they have inﬂicted, and now I want what’s best for them.

When you are indoors, you feel that you have very limited escape possibilities, and this unnerves you. 4 Afraid of Metal - you are afraid of metal objects. Metal objects are unnatural. They have snags and barbs that cut the skin and might let the soul leak out or let evil leak in. 5 Superstitious - you are afraid of something innocuous, you always do something before combat, or in a world of magic your superstition is actually logical however no one else knows what you know and they think you are superstitious. work with the dungeon master on this one. 6 Permanently Illiterate - you simply can’t ﬁgure out how all of these little squiggles mean anything.

University Graduate You have spent years learning the lore of the multiverse from master instructors in one of the universities of Oerik.  Some of the more renowned include the Royal University of Rel Mord, the University of Greyhawk City College, Sultan Rusal II Academy in Zeir-i-Zeif and the Imperial College in Tian-La. You scoured manuscripts, studied scrolls, and listened to the greatest experts of your age concerning history, medicine, the natural world, and of course arcane lore.. Your efforts have made you a master in your Chapter 4: Backgrounds 383 ﬁelds of study, as well as an alumni to your prestigious university. Skill Proﬁciencies: Arcana, History Tool Proﬁciencies: Calligrapher’s tools Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A bottle of black ink, a ink pen, a small knife, small bag of sand, a scrap of paper with several unknown arcane equations that you have not yet been able to decipher, a robes, and a pouch containing 15 gp Specialty To determine the nature of your scholarly training, roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below. d8 Specialty 1 Alchemist 2 Astronomer 3 Discredited academic 4 Librarian 5 Professor 6 Researcher 7 Wizard’s apprentice 8 Scribe Feature: Researcher When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

Suggested Characteristics University students are deﬁned by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reﬂect this life of study, observation, and practical aplication.

After years of purposeless wandering and fruitless searching, you have found your cause. Be it a god or religion, a political campaign, a philosophical movement, or simply promotion of Master Dag Blackhammer’s ﬁnest Ichor IPA and ales, you have seen the light and are wholeheartedly devoted to furthering your chosen cause. You are dogged and adamant in your promotion of this cause, preaching to anyone and everyone about your truth. You cannot stand to be Chapter 4: Backgrounds 385 contradicted and see it as blasphemy. And yes, you drive your party members up a wall on a regular basis. One of these days you may be murdered in your sleep. How did you ﬁnd your cause? Were you led into it by a friend or family member?

Aggressively. Any time you are in a populated area, you are out on the street corners, ringing your bell, trying to draw in a crowd, soliciting donations, giving Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

386 rousing speeches and, of course, passing out pamphlets that you create in your spare time. Sometimes you are able to successfully persuade members of the crowd to your cause, and as such ﬁnd them to be willing acolytes, malleable to instruction. What you do with their malleability is, of course, entirely up to you. You are also able to collect modest donations while spending time in the street amongst the masses. However, not everyone appreciates your little rallies, and occasionally you are targeted for harassment (or worse). Your single- mindedness is also seen as off-putting, and with the mentally disciplined it is often difﬁcult to make headway into friendships, or even working relationships. Suggested Characteristics Zealots are obvious pretty single-minded in their pursuits.  Most have no hobbies or outside interests outside their fanaticism. Personality Traits d8 Personality Trait 1 I have to speak with every potential convert, even if we’re in a hurry. 2 I mutter to myself constantly about my cause and my conversion plans. 3 I have very speciﬁc daily rituals related to my cause, and I become very cranky if I am not able to complete them. 4 I am naturally charming and charismatic, and you don’t even realize I’ve launched into a pitch about my cause until it’s too late. 5 I feel the need to bellow everything dramatically, as it seems to add importance to whatever I am saying. 6 I’m conﬁdent in my convictions, but I am very timid in speaking about them, and I often stutter and stumble when trying to explain the grand concepts of my cause. 7 I am very judgemental and like to whisper sly, cutting comments to nearby party members about other party members. 8 There is something off about me. I smile far too much and speak far too cheerily all the time. Ideals d6 Ideal 1 I will save them all. I have been granted a vision of truth, and I will use my knowledge to shepherd all I can into the safety of my ﬂock. (Good) 2 Truth and order must prevail. The world is chaos, and I have found the way to return it to perfect order. (Lawful) 3 This is my Path. What is, is. I have been set on a path and I will walk it, for good or ill. (Neutral) 4 For the Glory. I serve my cause knowing that I will be greatly rewarded for it. (Evil) Chapter 4: Backgrounds 387 5 A Sucker is Born Every Minute. People are so gullible. Dazzle them with a few promises and they’re eating out of your hands like street pigeons. (Neutral Evil) 6 This is the Greatest. Really. I just think this is the greatest, and everyone should know. (Neutral, Good) Bonds d6 Bond 1 You are itching to make a pilgrimage to the original source of your cause (shrine of a God, meeting with a political ﬁgure you are championing, tavern purveying the ﬁne goods you are trumpeting to all who will hear). 2 There is a faction of zealots directly opposed to your goals, and you ﬁnd yourself competing with them for converts, as well as seeking out fellow believers for support and aid. 3 Your parents just don’t get you. You’ve tried to explain, but they still don’t understand why you’re throwing away your life with “this nonsense”. You’ve decided to cut all ties and just hope that you never run into them. 4 You have a direct connection with the God/champion/philosopher/ prophet you are representing, and commune/correspond with them often asking for advice. 5 You lived a seedy life before you saw the light and donned your robes. You have tried to leave your past in the past, but inevitably it will catch up to you. 6 Your zealotry includes pursuit of a powerful magical artifact (a Holy Grail), and you will stop at nothing to obtain it. Flaws d6 Flaw 1 You really don’t know when to shut up. 2 You are blinded by your devotion to your cause, and have difﬁculty thinking critically and problem- solving. 3 You are so obsessed with advancing your cause that you have become an insomniac, and often stay up until all hours of the night writing out pamphlets, making plans, and generally muttering to yourself. 4 Your collected “donations” are actually used to support your addiction, and your God help you if your devotees ever ﬁnd out about this. 5 Beneath your front of devotion, you are actually a nihilist and a cynic, and lead an empty life marred by depression and a lack of a sense of purpose. 6 Your cause is actually terrible and you know it. The problem is, you are too prideful and have devoted too many years to it to actually admit it, so you keep on keeping on, pretending that everything is ﬁne. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

388 Your Family Tree Regardless of race or background, a character’s parentage can be important. While some individuals,’ abandoned at birth and raised in poor conditions, can go on to perform great deeds or achieve noble ranking, others raised in similar circumstances may accomplish nothing and live in utter squalor. The decision belongs to the individual, but his opportunities may depend on his origins. All characters may roll on the following tables to determine details of their parents’ lives. Any rolls that seem inappropriate to the character can be re- rolled. Alternatively, the DM and player may agree to choose an entry rather than roll on the tables. When rolling on the Parent Occupation Table, consider the situation of the character’s parents. For parents who live together (or did so but are now deceased), roll once for one parent and choose a compatible occupation for the other parent (for example, one parent living as a beggar and the other as a powerful noble is extremely unlikely). For parents living apart or when one is deceased, players may roll once for each parent. The occupations of a character‘s parents should factor into roleplaying from time to time. When a character is in an area in which his family had friends or enemies or had gained notoriety, the PC can use this to his advantage (or the DM may use it to the character‘s disadvantage) to gain audience, purchase expensive or rare items, or get a good table in a restaurant. If the character‘s heritage ‘‘leaks’’ in an area of his family’s enemies, they may be faced with any number of obstacles. Characters may roll only once on the Family Contact Table. This lists useful or important friends the character may have as a result of connections to his parents, siblings or other relations. This does not guarantee aid from such NPCs, however; it merely means that the NPC will remember the character and be inclined to listen to his warnings, appeals for aid and so on.

Chapter 4: Backgrounds 389 Creative Characters Many players new to the World of Greyhawk may feel constrained by the rich cultural details the game presents, especially with all the added options as part of Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY, and can ﬁnd it difﬁcult to portray their character as anything but a stereotypical member of its culture. However, the cultural details presented in the game are merely representative of the broad traits ascribed to those cultures, and just as people in our own world rarely ﬁt a stereotype exactly, the same is true of those native to Oerth. Even in cases where a character is fairly typical, many aspects of personality, not to mention background and appearance, are not mentioned in the cultural guides, such as sense of humour, personal quirks and preferences, and so on. These present any player with a wide number of ways in which to personalize the archetype they choose, without contradicting the broad cultural description if they don’t wish to. Three factors contribute to the overall quality and depth of any given character: Background, Personality, and Appearance. When creating a character it is not necessary to write chapter upon chapter, painstakingly detailing the character’s life, outlook, and appearance, but by simply considering the questions put forward in this document, and writing a handful of short answers, a character can be given a life and personality beyond that of a simple archetype. Each of the three sections will present appropriate questions, not all of which need be answered, and not all of which will necessarily be applicable. If possible, the player and DM should work together to create the character, ensuring it is playable and not overly disruptive to the game they wish to play. Background Arguably the most important aspect of character creation is a character’s background. More than just the environment in which the character grew Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

390 up, a good background provides a sense of personal history and it is often the character’s upbringing and experiences in life that most deﬁne their personality and outlook. Remember: signiﬁcant events, personages, and the like, need not necessarily be notable for good reasons; bad events can be just as memorable. Family

❉What were the character’s parent(s) or guardian like?

❉Does the character have any siblings?

❉Does the character have a family of their own, or did they?

❉If no, do they ever intend to settle down?

❉What about other relatives; were any memorable for any reasons?

❉What is the current status of any of the character’s relatives, i.e. alive, dead, missing, estranged, ill, enslaved, imprisoned, or divorced?

❉Were there any skeletons in the family closet?

❉Did they ﬁnd any of it particularly difﬁcult or easy? Has the character done anything particularly notable since completing their training?

❉What contacts, friends, enemies or mentors did the character make while training, or pursuing their career? Personality The character’s personality deﬁnes how they are role-played, and should be detailed bearing in mind the character’s Background, as described above. Consider how the character’s upbringing, family, past experiences, etc. affected their world view, morality, and so on, and if they turned out the way they did because of, or in spite of, their Background. Consider how they ﬁt their cultural stereotype, and how they differ from it. Attitudes

❉Is there anything the character will not do? Miscellaneous

❉What is the character’s sense of humour like?

❉Does the character have any hobbies?

❉Does the character have any mental or behavioural quirks, ﬂaws, or aberrations? Appearance The character’s appearance is usually the ﬁrst thing anyone notices about them, and can say a lot about their personality, profession, and background. Detailing what the character looks like gives the player a good mental image of the character, vital in imagining scenes in the game. The character’s appearance also helps other players visualize the character, and enables DMs to determine how NPCs might react to the character. However, the character’s appearance need not necessarily reﬂect all of their qualities, although it will always reﬂect some; not every warrior looks grim and determined, and not every sorcerer looks thin and bookish, for example.

392 Equipment W hile the PHB provides a good basic selection of gear, weapons and armour for adventurers to choose from, many items players of 1e might remember are absent. In many cases, the selection of weapons has been simpliﬁed. While the weapons and armour presented in the PHB can be used as described in that tome, the following variant weapons, armour, and optional properties, are intended to cover some items that lost their functionality due to the rules changes of 5th edition. The rules are very general, and try to follow the pattern of the game; the main intention is to offer an alternative more in keeping with the feel of 1e. Aklys. The aklys is a hooked throwing club with a 20-foot-long cord, usually of woven leather. Some aklyses have holes drilled through them and whistle when ﬂung. You can retrieve the aklys after throwing it as a bonus action. The hook allows you to make trip attacks at range with advantage. Atlatl. The atlatl is a tool that uses leverage to achieve greater velocity in dart-throwing. It consists of a shaft with a cup or a spur at the end that supports and propels the butt of the dart. The atlatl is held in one hand, gripped near the end farthest from the cup. The dart is thrown by the action of the upper arm and wrist. The throwing arm together with the atlatl acts as a lever. The spear-thrower is a low-mass, fast-moving extension of the throwing arm, increasing the length of the lever. This extra length allows the thrower to impart force to the dart over a longer distance, thus imparting more energy and ultimately higher speeds. Arming Sword. The most common sword across most of the Flanaess sometimes known as a knightly sword. It is a straight, double- edged weapon with a single-handed, cruciform hilt and a blade length of about 28 to 31 inches (70 to 80 centimetres). Proﬁciency with a longsword allows you to add your proﬁciency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Note: This is what was called a longsword in 1e.

Bagh-nakh, otherwise known as tiger claws (in the Baklunish West) or nekode (in western Oerik), are straps or gloves ﬁtted with spikes, around four to ﬁve attached to a metal crossbar, with a ring at each end. This bar was connected along the wearer’s palm and back of hand by a metal strip that was attached to another bracelet-type bar that went around the wearer’s wrist. The claws are situated in such a way that they emerged between a wearer’s ﬁngers whenever they made a ﬁst,[5][2] and were generally wielded like a pair of brass knuckles. Bardiche. A bardiche is a type of poleaxe used mainly by humanoids from the eiger of Ull and the Barrier Peaks to the euroz and kell of the Pomarj. It is perhaps best known as the weapon of choice of the minotaurs of Pesh (and elsewhere) as it is the preferred weapon of their demonic lord, Baphomet. The bardiche differs from the halberd in having neither a hook at the back nor a spear point at the top. The blade of the bardiche varies greatly in shape, but is most often a long, cleaver-type blade. Battleaxe. A battleaxe is a simple axe head mounted on a wooden or metal haft about 21/2​ to ​3 feet (76​ to ​ 91 centimetres) long. They can be ornate or plain, with blades either slightly curved or rounded. Some battleaxes have a short spike or blade on the back of their axeheads, as well as a spike on the end of their shafts. Blow gun. Almost everyone is acquainted with the wooden blow gun. The weapon varies in length from 4 feet to 7 feet and weighs from 1-3 pounds. Popularly thought of as a weapon for jungle-dwelling primitive tribes, the blow gun is heavily underestimated. Although its size makes it cumbersome to use in a crowded area, its breath-propelled, needle-like darts are quite useful on the plains, in the mountains, or in desert and forest regions. Darts for the blow gun are seldom more than long, thin needles with light cloth vanes. Most blow gun-using cultures utilize poison to add the threat of death to what usually would be just a nuisance weapon. Ranges given herein are for “standard adventuring conditions” (if such things exist), such as draughty dungeon corridors and mildly breezy outdoor areas. Bola. The bola was historically used by Bwan dwur (jungle dwarves) tribes to hunt ostriches. It consists of two or three weighted and/or spiked balls connected by a light barbed chain or cord. The bola is thrown at an opponent’s legs in such a manner that the victim (if the weapon hits) must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.  On a  failed save the target falls prone and is grappled. The target may attempt to break free at the start of their turn with a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw. Various battleaxes Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

398 Boomerang. The most marvellous accomplishment in weaponry by the early Touv people of Hepmonaland is the boomerang. A specially curved and aerodynamically contoured piece of wood, the boomerang—when properly thrown—will return to the thrower if it fails to hit its target. Brass Knuckles. Found across nearly all cultures in one form or another, brass knuckles increase the damage done by your unarmed attacks. Brass knuckles, or knuckledusters, are pieces of metal shaped to ﬁt around the knuckles. Designed to preserve and concentrate a punch’s force by directing it toward a harder and smaller contact area, they result in increased tissue disruption, including an increased likelihood of fracturing the victim’s bones on impact. The extended and rounded palm grip also spreads across the attacker’s palm the counter-force that would otherwise be absorbed primarily by the attacker’s ﬁngers, reducing the likelihood of damage to the attacker’s ﬁngers. Broadsword. This one-handed, double-edged sword is characterised by a basket-shaped guard that protects the hand. The broadsword is a cut and thrust sword which ﬁnds the most use among the highland Flan of Perrenland, Ket, Highfolk and the Vesve and Bramblewood forests. This sword contrasts with the rapier, the thrust-oriented sword most often worn by civilian adventurers of all types across the Flanaess and beyond. Proﬁciency with a longsword allows you to add your proﬁciency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Buckler. A buckler is a small shield, up to 18 in (45 cm) in diameter, gripped in the ﬁst with a central handle behind the boss. Its size makes it poor protection against missile weapons (e.g., arrows) but useful in deﬂecting the blow of an opponent’s weapons, binding his arms or hindering his movements. A buckler provides a +1 to AC when equipped. It can be used to attack doing either bludgeoning or piercing damage depending on whether or not it is spiked. Butterﬂy Sword.  The butterﬂy sword is a short dao, or single-edged sword, from the southern Celestial Empire and its tributary states, though it can also be found further north and even as far away as the Zahind states. The blade of a butterﬂy sword is roughly as long as a human forearm, which allows easy concealment inside loose sleeves or boots, and allows greater maneuverability when spinning and rotating during close-quarters ﬁghting. Butterﬂy swords are usually wielded in pairs. A pair of swords will often be carried side by side within the same scabbard, so as to give the appearance of a single weapon. Proﬁciency with a shortsword allows you to add your proﬁciency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Catch Pole. As suggested by the name, this weapon is usually not used to kill but to capture. The catch pole is a pincer/jaw device mounted on a pole. The pincer portion of the weapon is commonly 3 feet in length with the pole itself anywhere from 4 feet to 6 feet long and ﬂanked by the appropriate manipulation apparatus. This apparatus allows the user to open and close the pincer of the instrument and latch the jaws shut once the victim is entrapped. On a successful hit against a Chapter Five: Equipment 399 medium or small humanoid or beast the target is grappled. At the start if each of your turns you may make an opposed Strength (athletics) check to move the grappled target up to your movement speed and you can choose to move it adjacent to you or keep it at reach. You are at disadvantage on Attacks with a catch pole against opponents within 5 feet of you. If you drop the catch pole, the target can free himself as an action. Chakram.  The chakram is a metal disc, 9 to 12 inches in diameter and about 1 inch thick at the center, with sharpened edges. It is typically used typically used as a thrown weapon but is sturdy enough to be used to slash in melee combat. Club. This is a piece of stout wood shaped or re-purposed to bludgeon an enemy. Clubs can be intricately carved pieces of art or as simple as a tree branch or stout piece of wood. Crossbow, hand. Sometimes referred to as an alley bow by rogues or rufﬁans, this small crossbow ﬁres small bolts that are sometimes used to deliver poison to the target. It’s small enough to be ﬁred one-handed, but it still requires two hands to load. Crossbow, heavy. This large crossbow is harder to load and more substantial than a regular crossbow, but it packs a greater punch. You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Crossbow, light. This ranged weapon has a bow-like assembly mounted on a handled frame called a tiller. The tiller has a mechanism to lock the bowstring in place, attached to a trigger mechanism that releases the tension and launches a bolt. Crossbow, repeating. The Cho-ku- no is a repeating crossbow used exclusively in the Celestial Empire. A “clip” atop the bow holds up to 6 bolts at a time and gives the ability to ﬁre the weapon twice as one Attack action. The crossbow’s “clip” requires an action to reload and can be ﬁtted with normal light crossbow bolts. Cutlass. A cutlass is a short, broad slashing sword, with a straight or slightly curved blade sharpened on the cutting edge, and a hilt often featuring a solid cupped or basket- shaped guard. It is a common naval weapon found throughout the Azure Sea and similar swords can also be found among Sunelan mariners. Proﬁciency with a scimitar allows you to add your proﬁciency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Dagger. A dagger has a double-sided blade about 1 foot in length. It can be thrown but is not speciﬁcly weighted for such use Dart. Darts are airborne ranged weapons. They are designed to ﬂy such that a sharp, often weighted point will strike ﬁrst. They can be distinguished from javelins by their shorter length and the presence of feathers on the tail and a shaft. Darts Monk Weapons The following weapons qualify as monk weapons: butterfly sword, club, dagger, hanbo, handaxe, javelin, kama, light ham- mer, light mace, parang, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, sickle, spear, spiked chain, tessen and tonfa Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

400 are propelled by hand, they can be distinguished from arrows because they are too short to be used in a bow. Discus. The discus is a Murian thrown weapon used primarily by Monster Hunters in the wastelands of Pesh.  It is a disc about 9 inches in diameter and 13/4 inches thick at its centre. It is made of hardened wood with a smooth metal rim and small, circular brass plates set ﬂush into its sides. It is heavy for a thrown weapon and the wielder typically builds up centrifugal force by making several quick spins before launching the discus much like a human sling. Estoc. An estoc is a sword about as long as a longsword, but designed exclusively for thrusting attacks. Its “blade” is steel spike with a triangular, square, or hexagonal cross-section. Like the longsword, an estoc can be used one, or two-handed. Falcata. The falcata has a single-edged blade that pitches forward towards the point, the edge being concave near the hilt, but convex near the point. This shape distributes the weight in such a way that the falcata is capable of delivering a blow with the momentum of an axe, while maintaining the longer cutting edge of a sword and some facility to execute a thrust. The grip is typically hook-shaped, the end often stylized in the shape of a horse or a bird. There is often a thin chain connecting the hooked butt with the hilt. These swords are of Murian origin and are usually found in that region although many can also be found in the Baklunish lands of Komal and Risay. Proﬁciency with a shortsword allows you to add your proﬁciency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Falchion. This sword has one curved, sharp edge with the back edge unsharpened and either ﬂat or slightly curved. Its weight is greater toward the end, making it better for chopping rather than stabbing. It is commonly found in use among soliders of lesser wealth across the Flanaess and Baklunish West. Proﬁciency with a shortsword allows you to add your proﬁciency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Falx. This military weapon is inspired by the common scythe, a farming implement used to cut swaths of grown hay, but it has a straight handle and a heavier blade. You may ignores all bonuses to AC from shields when making an attack with a falx. Fauchard. This polearm is similar to a glaive, being a curved blade afﬁxed to the end of a pole. Unlike a glaive, though, the cutting edge of a fauchard is along the concave side, causing the blade to resemble that of a sickle or scythe. Flail, footman’s. A large spiked metal bar like the end of a morningstar, which is attached by means of chain or swivel to a long handle, allowing one or two handed usage. The heavy ﬂail is a fantastic anti-armor weapon, with both the ability to penetrate, and increased leverage with two hands. When used against heavy armor the footman’s ﬂail does an extra die of damage on a successful hit. Flail, horseman’s. The familiar 2lb spiked ball at the end of a length of chain, attached to a short iron or wooden haft usually similar in length to a handaxe. The light ﬂail sees lightning fast attacks turned into a great boon for the master, carrying the weapons speed and momentum into another attack if they miss. A ﬁghter using a horseman’s ﬂail gains advantage on all rolls to trip and opponent. Chapter Five: Equipment 401 Gaff. A gaff hook is a long pole with a hook on one end for spearing ﬁsh. Pirates often add extra, heavier hooks to both ends of gaff hooks to assist with boarding actions. After the pirates use grappling hooks to draw ships close together, they hook the gunwales together with boarding gaffs to prevent the ships from drifting. Small crafts often use boarding gaffs in place of grappling hooks. Boarding gaffs bite deeply into the wood of the railing. It takes 1 minute to pry a boarding gaff loose. Most pirates use a boarding axe or cutlass to cut through boarding gaffs rather than trying to unhook them one by one. The gaff can also be used for ﬁshing when not in combat. Garrotte. The garrotte is typically a braided leather thong with hand grips at either end of its 3-foot-long cord, and is used to throttle an opponent from behind. On a successful sneak attack against a small or medium creature, the target is grappled and cannot breathe. As long as you maintain the grapple, the creature takes 1d6 damage on each of your subsequent turns without requiring an attack roll, and you may add your sneak attack damage to the damage. The creature grappled by you cannot speak or otherwise make sound to alert others. Attacks made against the grappled creature have advantage as long as it is grappled by this weapon. Glaive. At it’s simplest a glaive is composed of a simple blade mounted on the end of a pole about 7 feet in length. They are used extensively by the peasant militias of western Oerik where they are simple weapons, whereas on the Flanaess they tend to be quite ornate and used by highly skilled elite warriors, particularly notable among several royal guards of the region. Greataxe. The greataxe is a large, heavy battleaxe with a double-bladed head. The shaft is usually constructed of stout wood with about half it’s length being just the grip alone. Wielded two-handed, the double blades allow for an alternating forward/ backswing attack with devastating results. Greatclub. A heavy, two-handed version of the simple club.  A great club could be as simple as a heavy tree limb to the ornately carved to-aloa wooden greatclubs of the Sunelan islands. Greatsword. This immense two- handed sword is nearly as tall as its wielder. Its lower blade is often somewhat dulled to allow it to be gripped for extra leverage in close- quarter ﬁghts. The Mulwari hill tribes of Zahind are known for their ferocious two-handed sword- wielding dervishes. Guisarme. A sharpened and sturdy pruning hook, developed as a peasant weapon from modifying a farm tool. The curved hook of the blade allows the guisarme to be used as a tripping weapon or to pull foes from the saddle. The guisarme is a favourite of common militias of the Flanaess who will face cavalry in battle, as the masters with this weapon ﬁnd they can pull a knight from the saddle with relative ease. When using a guisarme you have advantage on any rolls to force a rider to dismount from a creature or from the outside of a vehicle such as a cart of wagon. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

402 Halberd. The halberd consists of an axe blade topped with a spike mounted on a long shaft. It always has a hook or thorn on the back side of the axe blade for grappling mounted combatants. When using a halberd you have advantage on any rolls to force a rider to dismount from a creature or from the outside of a vehicle such as a cart of wagon. The halberd was usually 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 metres) long. Halberds are found widely across most cultures on Oerik and are often seen as the preferred weapon of palace and town guards from Tian-La to Rauxes. Handaxe. This axe is short (roughly 1 foot long) and designed for use with one hand. Unlike throwing axes, it is not well balanced for a graceful tumbling motion, and is instead heavier at its head. Tomahawks, war hatchets, and other such names usually refer to hand axes. Harpoon. A harpoon is a large, barbed spear that is typically ﬁtted to 50’ feet of thick rope (5 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.) When the other end of the rope is anchored, either held by a creature in both hands or tied to a solid object, a creature damaged by the harpoon cannot move farther away from the anchor unless it breaks the rope. In addition, the rope can be used with two hands to drag a creature struck by the harpoon towards the anchor. Every 5’ the target is dragged costs the creature pulling the rope 10’ of movement. The normal Strength and Size limitations on dragging still apply. Proﬁciency with a spear allows you to add your proﬁciency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Hora. A hora is a set of knuckledusters common in the Zahind lands.  Unlike common brass knuckles, the hora have vicious serrations and spikes jutting from the knuckles causing piercing damage. They are commonly found amongst the street gangs of Zahindian cities. Jambiya. This is a curved dagger, worn by many in the Baklunish lands. It is a symbol of adulthood and honour that doubles as a weapon. Javelin. A javelin is a thin throwing spear but can be used in melee in a pinch. The javelin is the preferred ranged weapon of the Murians. Jian. A jian is the most common dao, the Suh word for sword. It is a double-edged straight sword, often with a tassel attached to the hilt. Proﬁciency with a longsword allows you to add your proﬁciency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Kama. Similar to a sickle—and in some regions still used to reap grain—a kama is a short, curved blade attached to a simple handle, usually made of wood. It is frequently used in pairs and if so equipped, the wielder gains a +1 bonus to their AC. Katana. A single edged, slightly curved sword with a minimal guard called a tsuba and a longer handle than swords of southern and eastern Oerik used by elite and/or wealthy warriors in western Oerik. The longer handle and curved edge provide different leverage and more effective deﬂections. Proﬁciency with a longsword allows you to add your proﬁciency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Katar. The katar is a triangular blade ground to an edge on either side and attached to an H-shaped handle. Often referred to as a “punch dagger,” the katar is held in the clenched ﬁst and used much as a normal ﬁst would be, with the blade pointed away from the user’s knuckles. The katar is used to stab or slash, a blow which carries considerable power Chapter Five: Equipment 403 when its direct stabbing abilities are taken into account. The katar’s great speed is because of the quickness involved in its simple deployment as an extension of the ﬁst. It’s also very easy to learn to use. Knife, throwing. Small, balanced knives with a broad piercing tip and sharpened pommel, no longer than 4”-6”. Easily hidden, these blades offer more range than throwing stars due to the higher weighted pommel. A master has the capability to dance in a quick circle, throwing knives at all foes around them. Kora. A

sword, traditionally found in the mountainous nation of Behow, with a typical, curved and forward ﬂaring blade. With the cutting edge on the inner side of the blade’s arch. The wide, doubly ﬂared tip of the blade is blunt. What is notable about this sword are the especially ﬁne engravings—on both sides along the back, and on the back of the blade, as well as on the wide surface at the upper end of the blades. Engraved delicate dots, strokes and three lotus ﬂower wheels on each of the two sides — ﬁlled, in part, with red. The iron hilt of the kora sports gleaming yellow brass decorations, as well as two black, iron end-horns. ] Kukri. A forward curved dagger with a cutting edge on the inside, performing more like a handaxe than a ﬁnesse blade. The Kukri is a weapon of strength over ﬁnesse, but the master uses its cutting edge to be more ruthless than any other dueling blade. It is the signature weapon of the Desert Flower sect of assassins in the Tyurzi mountain foothills of Mulwar but can be found as far away as the Baklunish West travelling along the Salt Route. Kyogetsu-shoge. This weapon consists of a foot-long double-edged blade, with another smaller, curved hook-blade sticking out the side like a rooster’s spur. The blade is strung to a large iron hoop with 10-foot length of silk rope. It is a favoured assassins weapon in the Ryuujin Empire. Lance. This spear-like weapon is used by a mounted creature to deal a great deal of damage. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted. Leiomano. The leiomano is a shark- toothed club used by Sunelan islanders. The weapon resembles a thick paddle inset with shark teeth. The tiger shark is the preferred donor. These teeth are placed into grooves in the club and sewn into place. The tip of the handle also may utilize a marlin bill as a dagger.  On a critical hit against a unarmoured or lightly armoured target, this weapon does an extra die of damage due to bleeding caused by the rasping shark teeth. Light Hammer. A light pick is a modiﬁed mining implement with a wooden shaft ending in a pick head crafted more to pierce armor and ﬂesh than chip rocks. It is a common weapon among the noniz people. Longbow. This 5-foot-tall bow, usually made of a single piece of elm, hickory, or yew, has a powerful draw and is excellent at propelling arrows with great force and at an extreme distance. You must use two hands to ﬁre a longbow, and it can’t be used while mounted. Longsword. Longswords are large, straight swords, typically dual-edged with blades between 3 and foot feet in length.  They have large pommels Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

404 and can be wielded in one hand or two. (Note: This weapon was known as a bastard sword in 1e). Macuahuitl. The maquahuitl is a common weapon used by Olman people of the Amedio jungle. Its sides are embedded with prismatic blades traditionally made from obsidian (volcanic glass); obsidian is capable of producing an edge sharper than a razor blades. It is capable of inﬂicting serious lacerations from the rows of obsidian blades embedded in its sides. These could be knapped into blades or spikes, or into a circular design that look like scales. The maquahuitl is not speciﬁcally a sword or a club, although it approximates an arming sword in its use. On a critical hit against a unarmoured or lightly armoured target, this weapon does an extra die of damage due to bleeding caused by the razor sharp obsidian shards breaking off in the wound. Mace, heavy.  With a stout wooden or metal haft and a heavy metal head, sometimes ﬂanged, a heavy mace is sturdy and allows its wielder to deliver powerful blows and crush armor Mace, light. A light mace has a short wooden haft ending with a dense metal or stone head. Used much like a club, it delivers heavy bludgeoning blows Maul. Mauls are massive warhammers that must be swung with two hands; they cannot be wielded one-handed. Morningstar. Similar to a mace, a morningstar is effectively a short shaft ending in a weighted head, studded with spikes. Nagamaki. The nagamaki is a weapon found mainly in Minyeo, Wunan and the Ryuujin islands of western Oerik where it is used as an infantry weapon, frequently used against cavalry. It straddles the line between sword and polearm consisting of a long sword with a blade that could be 2 feet or more and a handle equal length to the blade or longer. The blade is single-edged and it often resembles a naginata blade, but the main difference between them is how the blades are mounted and that the handle of the nagamaki is not a simple wooden shaft as in the naginata; it is made more like a katana hilt. The nagamaki is used in large sweeping and slicing strokes. Naginata. The naginata consists of a 6-foot staff afﬁxed to a 2-foot-long, sword- like slightly curved blade. The shaft is designed to keep the wielder out of reach from swords and shorter weapons. It is a popular military weapon in western Oerik. No-dachi. This very long two- handed weapon has a slender but wickedly sharp 4-foot-long blade at one end and is predominantly used by ground troops in western Oerik to attack mounted warriors. It is also a favoured weapon of the Oni of Pesh. Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus Chapter Five: Equipment 405 action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. Nunchaku. The nunchaku is an almost direct adaptation of the common agricultural ﬂail used to separate rice from the stalk across western Oerik. They are made of two 12-inch long hardwood sticks about 1 inch in diameter and connected by either a stout leather cord or a metal chain. Having no mace-like head similar to the footman’s ﬂail, the nunchaku has a weapon speed the ﬂail cannot hope to attain; it is this speed which gives the nunchaku most of its damaging power and puts it on a par with conventional weaponry. Nunchaku are easily folded for concealment within a boot or pack, or to be tucked within a girdle or belt. N’zana. This is a wicked collection of blades more akin to an axe than a knife, has a main haft and 4-6 branch-like blades. The N’zana is not hurled vertically, as are most bladed missiles, but horizontally. The n’zanas heavy weight is the reason for its short ranges, but its damaging potential more than makes up for the range restrictions. These weapons are found exclusively among the Touv people of Hepmonaland and there are endless variations on the basic idea presented here. Olven Sabre. The deﬁnitive weapon of most olve across Oerik is the slender olven sabre. These ﬁnely crafted blades are between 21/2 and 3 feet in length and they have no crossguard to protect the single-handed hilt which is traditionally constructed of horn, antler or ivory. Proﬁciency with a shortsword allows you to add your proﬁciency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Parang. This medium-length sword has a wide blade and long grip. Though it is typically used to hack through heavy foliage, the machete can also be used as a deadly weapon. Proﬁciency with a shortsword allows you to add your proﬁciency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Patu. These types of short-handled clubs are mainly used as a striking weapon. They are found exclusively among the Sunelan islanders and are typically swing with a horizontal thrust straight from the shoulder at the enemy’s head. Most patu are made of pounamu (a greenstone native to the Sunelan islands similar to jade). Sunelans decorate the patu by carving elaborate patterns into the stone. Pike. This very long spear is purely for thrusting rather than throwing. Used by many soldiers and city watch for crowd control and defense against charging enemies, it must be wielded with two hands. You have 15 foot reach when wielding a pike but you suffer disadvantage on attack rolls against targets closer than 10 feet. Pulwar. The pulwar is a great, two- handed curved sword, typically widening toward the end where is tapers to a sharp point. They are common in Zahind lands, less so in the Baklunish lands and almost unseen outside those regions. Ranseur. Ranseurs are spear-like weapons that have long, tapered tips with two wing-like projections at their base. These secondary barbs projected out at about 45° from the center line, but are curved backward. The base of their heads are often indented, forming a trap between the head and secondary tines. Their shafts are typically 8​ to ​10 feet (2.4​ to ​3 meters) long. Due to their length, ranseurs have be wielded two-handed by human- Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

406 sized creatures. Ranseurs, like most pole arms, are very effective in large numbers, in combination with other types of forces, and when wielded by well-trained troops. Rapier. The rapier is a long and thin piercing blade with a basket hilt. It is prized among many as a dueling weapon and is the preferred blade among the olvenfolk, who are renowned for their classic designs. Sabre. Sabres a slightly curved, single-edged, one-handed weapons often with a basket hilt and no counterweight, allowing expert deﬂections off the curve and increased defense of the hand.  They are the preferred weapon of many horsemen across Oerik, most notably the Paynim nomads, the Chakyik and Wegwiur tribes and the raiders of Sa’han. Sai. The sai is an edgeless dagger- type weapon resembling a hand- held trident. It was derived from an instrument used by the farmers of the Minyeo region for handling hay. With a cylindrical blade anywhere from 13 to 20 inches in length and a specially modiﬁed hilt assembly rising 4 inches parallel to the blade the sai is useless for cutting and is a stabbing weapon on. The hilt serves to protect the hand and if a sai is equipped in both hands, the user gains a +1 bonus to their AC. Sap. A generic term for a leather bag ﬁlled with lead pellets or heavy stones which is used as a bludgeon, the black- jack is a very popular weapon among thieves and assassins. Due to its great damaging power and ease of concealment, it is also a favourite weapon among sailors and press gangs in search of new “recruits.” The blackjack was used by different cultures around the world, with the American Indians even possessing a similar form of cudgel ﬁlled with sand, occasionally tied to a cord to be whirled and thrown. (Treat such weapons as thrown clubs for purposes of “to hit” adjustments and damage.) Scimitar. This Baklunish one-handed curved blade is sharp on one side and about the same length as a short sword. They are as common in Baklunish lands as the arming sword is on the Flanaess. Siangham. A siangham looks like a heavy metal arrow with a hilt or handle where the feathers would be. It has a piercing tip. It is a simple peasants weapon in Zahind lands. Sickle. Originally a farming tool used for reaping grain, this one-handed weapon has a short wooden handle ending in a curved blade, sometimes sharpened on both sides. Shortbow. A shortbow is made up of one piece of wood, about 3 feet in length. You need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a shortbow while mounted at disadvantage. Shortbow, composite. A composite bow is very similar to its normal version, but is constructed of stronger material, or reinforced with some complementary material or curvature. Usually these shortbows are made of, or reinforced by, horn while others are recurved, allowing for a stronger pull, either way they require a minimum of strength to be used. They do not require special training, if you have proﬁciency with the shortbow you also know how to use a composite version of that bow. You need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a shortbow while mounted at disadvantage. Shortsword. Short swords are some of the most common weapons found across Oerik, and thus designs are extremely varied, depending on the Chapter Five: Equipment 407 Glaive Bardiche Voulge Fauchard Guisarme Ranseur Quarterstaff Spear Javelin Kama Heavy Mace Butterﬂy Sword Katana Lance Dagger Siangham Short Sword Nunchaku Falcata Broadsword Arming Sword Longsword Greatsword Pulwar Scimitar Sabre Rapier Heavy Crossbow Light Crossbow Hand Crossbow N’zana Sling Boomerang Dart Pike Longbow Shortbow Composite Shortbow Spiked Chain Club Battleaxe Greataxe Handaxe Throwing Axe Warpick Light Mace Light Pick Warhammer Maul Kukri Katar Sap Sickle Footman’s Flail Horseman’s Flail Morningstar Whip Tetsubo Net Nagamaki Halberd Trident Kyogetsu- shoge Shuriken Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

408 region and creator. Most are around 2 feet in length. Their blades can be curved or straight, single- or double-edged, and wide or narrow. Hilts may be ornate or simple, with crossguards, basket hilts, or no guard at all. Such weapons are often used on their own, but can also be paired as a matched set, or used in conjunction with a dagger or longer sword. Shuriken. Circular or star shaped metal disks made to be palmed together and thrown either with precision or a pepper of smaller strikes to disable an enemy before a follow-up attack. They often have a hole in the center to reduce weight and sharpened tips in a concentric pattern. The ﬂat, small design of these weapons allows many to be palmed at once and, with proper training, thrown all together. In place using Flurry of Blows, a monk can instead make two ranged attacks with shuriken as a bonus action before taking the Attack action. Sling. A sling is little more than a leather cup attached to a pair of straps that can be used to ﬂing smooth stones or sling bullets at a range. You can ﬁre, but not load, a sling with one hand. Sodegarami. The sodegarami, or sleeve-tangler, is a highly specialized weapon, used to catch and entangle an opponent without causing great harm. It is normally used to hook and catch the clothing of an opponent. On a successful hit the target is grappled if they are wearing padded, hide or no armor. At the start if each of your turns you may make an opposed Strength (athletics) check to move the grappled target up to your movement speed and you can choose to move it adjacent to you or keep it at reach. These weapons are used extensively my law enforcement in the cities and towns of the Celestial Empire. Spatha. The spatha is the preferred blade of the Murian warrior. It’s straight, heavy blade measures between 30 and 40 inches and is sharpened on both edges.  It has a sturdy, counter-weighted pommel large enough for only one hand. Spear. A spear is a long metal or hardened wood shaft ending with a metal spike. A spear can be used one-handed as a melee weapon and can be thrown. It is often paired with a shield in places as disparate as Mur and the Thillonrian peninsula. Spiked Chain. Spiked chains are a length of metal chain whose last few links on each end are enlarged and enhanced with spikes. At the half- way point of the chain and/or the midpoints of the two halves, a link of the chain was often replaced with a ring for grasping. Spiked chains are similar to the whip in that they are a reach weapon that could attack targets from 10 feet away. It requires two hands to wield effectively. Tanto. The tanto is a  classic western Oerik dagger with a blade  between 10 and 12 inches. Tessen. The tessen, or war fan, consists of a metal skeleton with silk or cloth stretched over it. The edges and tips of the fan’s ribs have been sharpened, much as a dagger blade would be, with the canvas often painted in lovely colours to further complement the weapon’s illusion of harmlessness. The rapid folding and unfolding of the fan in battle is a very important part of the weapon’s use; this action, along with ﬂuttering and waving the fan, causes enough of a distraction to allow the user to draw a dagger or ready a spell component with the other hand. The main problem with the fan is the tendency Chapter Five: Equipment 409 for blood to stain the painted canvas, requiring either repainting or the installation of a new canvas in order to keep the passive appearance of the weapon, which is so necessary for using a tessen in a surprise attack. When making an attack with the tessen, you may use a bonus action to make an attack using a light weapon in your other hand.  This bonus action attack is made with advantage. This weapon is found exclusively in the Celestial Empire and its environs. Tetsubo. A reﬁned version of the great club from western Oerik, this weapon consists of a long, slender length of ironwood whose upper half is shod with a thick sheet of studded iron. The iron gives added weight and strength to the club, while the studs are designed to crack helmets and armor. Throwing Axe. This is a small axe balanced for throwing. Tlalochtli. The tlacochtli is a barbed javelin with an attached line, and is used much like a whaler’s harpoon. The tlacochtli is equipped with a 50-foot-long cord which is used to either force a victim to surrender by threat of pulling the javelin out violently, or to retrieve the missile should it miss or become embedded in an undesired or uncooperative target. When the tlacochtli is ripped out of a wound it will do the another 1d6 piercing damage, just as it did going in. Thus, anyone hit by a tlacochtli will be required to cut the line, hold it stationary, or do whatever is necessary to keep the javelin from being forced back out. Tonfa. The tonfa is a cudgel-type weapon with a 2-foot- long, ﬂat body and a 6-inch-long handle one quarter of the way down the main body and placed perpendicular to same. The tonfa is wielded by holding the handle in the clenched ﬁst with the main piece lying alongside the outside of the user’s fore- arm, with the part of the weapon directly opposite the handle protruding outward from the side of the ﬁst. The tonfa can be twirled to bash a foe (as with a club), or the weapon’s outstretched section can punch or gouge a victim. The tonfa is another weapon found exclusively in western Oerik, and a traditional instrument in many western martial Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

410 arts. The tonfa may be considered a monk weapon. Trident. This three-pronged, spear-like weapon typically has a 4-foot shaft. Like a spear, it can be wielded with one hand or thrown. It is classically associated with the sea and is a favoured weapon of tritons, sea elves, locathah, not mention their hated foes: the sahuagin Voulge. Superﬁcially, a voulge might strongly resemble a glaive, but there are some notable differences in construction. First, the attachment of the voulge blade to the shaft is usually done by binding the lower two thirds of the blade to the side of the pole; the glaive most often has a socket built into the blade itself and is mounted on top of the pole. In addition, while both have curved blades, that of the voulge is broad and meant for hacking with a long point meant for piercing at the top, while that of the glaive is narrow and meant more for cutting. A voulge thus looks something like a pointed meat cleaver attached to a long pole. Wakizashi. The wakizashi is basically a short katana, sharing almost identical design and forging process. A wakizashi’s blade is between 2’- 3’ ft (61-91 cm) in length and 1 inch (2.5 cm) in width. It is widely used by samurai in western Oerik, who consider the wakizashi almost as important a weapon as a katana. Samurai usually pair a wakizashi with a katana in a ﬁghting style called daisho (i.e. two weapon ﬁghting), which means “long and short”. Warhammer. This weapon consists of a wooden haft and a heavy, metal head. The head may be single (like a carpenter’s hammer) or double (like a sledgehammer). The haft is long enough that you may wield it one- or two-handed. Though heavy and relatively slow to wield, warhammers are capable of delivering immense blows, crushing armor and ﬂesh alike. War Pick. This military variant of the light pick has a longer handle and can be used with one or two hands. It is a common, inexpensive weapon for mounted soldiers since it can be used effectively from horseback. Whip. Braided leather set with bits of jagged glass, the bullwhip is more an instrument of torture than a weapon, but can be used as one. It is most often used to intimidate and sometimes to entangle or trip an opponent. Yantok. A Yantok is a short, one- handed rattan staff (i.e. stick) that normally measures between 24 and 28 inches (61 to 71 cm) in length with most being toward the upper end of this range. Most Yantoks are approximately one inch in diameter. There can be signiﬁcant variation in the diameter however since rattan vines naturally grow to variable thicknesses. The Yantok may be used by itself but is more often paired and used by dual wielders. When equipped with a yantok in both hands, the user gains a +1 bonus to AC. They are only found in the southern Celestial Empire and the nations bordering it where it is used in the local martial arts. Chapter Five: Equipment 411 Armor In all places, in all lands, the need to protect oneself in battle has always arisen. For some it is a simple shield or a coat of ﬁbres woven by a craftsman. For others, the armourer hammers out the plates of metal, fashioning them into gleaming suits of metal. Like weapons, the type of armor worn is often dependent on the region of ones birth. Geography and culture have made the armours of the Celestial Empire, Zahind or the Sunelan Coast as different from the armours of the Flanaess as they are from each other. In hot climates—steaming jungles, humid forests, and blistering steppes a man encased in metal could quickly die like a boiled lobster or, escaping that, slowly watch his treasured armour rust away to uselessness. Eventually rusted joints would lock, brittle hinge pins would shear away, unknown growths would weaken plates until there was little left but a decrepit shell. By far, the most common types of armor across Oerik are of cloth and leather. The ordinary foot soldier wears quilted layers of cotton or padded leathers. Higher ranking warriors may have suits of hardened studded leather. Chain shirts are often worn concealed under clothing or sewn in with rich silks and soft, dyed leathers. On rare occasions a noble may have armor built of metal bands. Solid iron and steel are reserved for helmets and critical areas of the body. Adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found on Oerik and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield. The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor and shields used in the worlds of D&D. Optional Damage Reduction The 5e system emphasizes simplicity which is not a bad thing however, this simplicity, when applied to armor, fundamentally changes the feel of armor from 1e. In an attempt to make the selection of armour a little more detailed and thoughtful process, Greyhawk Rebooted presents and optional damage reduction quality for various types of armor.

Plate armor, while almost fully encasing the wearer in metal, didn’t help a whole lot against bludgeoning and crushing weapons like maces and war hammers. If using this option, each type of armor has a DR rating against Slashing, Piercing and/or Bludgeoning damage (i.e. the armor reduces damage done of that type by the listed amount). Light Armor Made from cloth, leather, or other animal products and is usually less protective than the other armors but also provides the most mobility and least weight. You add your Dexterity modiﬁer to AC when you wear Light Armor. You can don and doff Light armor in 1 minute. Padded. Thick padding made of quilted fabrics or furs, this armor provides little more than slight protection from incidental contact, and restricts the wearer’s movement. Leather. This leather is of moderate thickness but is unhardened and offers similar protection to padded, but the thinner material no longer restricts the wearer. Studded Leather. This hardened leather has been studded with metal rivets or brackets to offer some increased protection. The increased time to stud the leather while not damaging its integrity adds to the manufacturing cost. Cord Armor. Made from hemp ﬁbres or similarly tough seaweed woven and knotted into a thick, tough covering, cord armor is common in places where metalworking and leather- working are not practiced like among the Sunelan islands, the Amedio and Vulzhar jungles and amongst the submarine peoples like tritons and sea elves. The armor forms a complete suit, hampering movement but offering decent protection without the use of metal or leather. Cord armor is particularly popular among wild elves, who often avoid curing animal hide. Hara-ate. The hara- ate is a simple form of body armor from western Oerik that covers mainly the chest and abdomen. It consists of a light breastplate and thigh protectors made of laced metal plates. Because of its light weight, it can also be worn under regular or formal clothing. Medium Armor A combination of leather or animal products and metal to create increased protection without completely sacriﬁcing mobility. It covers less than Heavy armor using the same materials and usually costs less due to a lighter manufacturing process and less material. You add up to +2 from your Dexterity modiﬁer to AC when you wear medium armor. You can don medium armor in 5 minutes, while you can doff it in 1 minute. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

414 Hide. A mix of furs, sturdy hide, and sometimes molded boiled leather, this armor provides protection due to its layers of leather, though its bulkiness slows the wearer down and decreases mobility. Chain Shirt. This is a shirt of butted mail. It is easy to produce, due to less time simply twisting chain rings into place, rather than welding each link closed. As such, the chain shirt offers less protection than the hauberk but is lighter and more affordable. Scalemail. Scale mail is made up of dozens of small, overlapping metal plates. Similar to both splint mail and banded, scalemail has a ﬂexible arrangement of scales in an attempt to avoid hindering the wearer’s mobility, but at the expense of omitting additional protective layers of armor. Breastplate. Wearing just the breastplate of a suit of plate armor, this armor provides the easiest mobility of the medium armors and more protection than the chain shirt or ring mail. However, plate is expensive to make and thus has a greatly increased cost. Half Plate. Half plate consists of most of the upper body plates used in full plate, with lighter or sparser steel plate protection for the arms and legs. This provides some of the protection of full plate with greater ﬂexibility and speed. Do-maru. The lightest of armors typically favoured by samurai, do- maru wraps around the wearer’s body like a short armoured coat. It consists primarily of lamellar and lacks a solid breastplate or sleeves, leaving the shoulders and upper body somewhat exposed, but permitting the wearer greater ﬂexibility than do the majority of heavier armors. Banded Mail. The quintessential half-plate, also known as lorica, this armor is a series of metal ribbons banded together to form more complete protection. Banded mail is cheaper to produce than full plate, but is still quite a process, involving many steel plates and precise shaping. Heavy Armor Weighing and costing the most, this armor is the most protective, but most restrictive available. Heavy armors are made almost entirely of metal and require extensive, p r o f e s s i o n a l m a n u f a c t u r i n g . All heavy armor requires a Strength score of 13 to wear. You do not add your Dexterity modiﬁer to AC when wearing heavy armor. Donning Heavy armor takes 10 minutes, while dofﬁng it takes 5. If you have help, these values are cut in half. Optional: Wearing heavy armor in hot climates like deserts and jungles require DC 14 Constitution saving throws each hour.  Failure results in one level of exhaustion. Ring Mail. A series of closed rings stitched to a thick leather backing. This armor takes about as long as a Chain shirt to make and is similar in cost, but due to the combined Chapter Five: Equipment 415 protection of the leather backing and metal rings, offers greater protection than either one separately. Unfortunately, this combined armor is more restrictive. Banded. Found almost exclusively in Mur were it is know locally as lorica, consists of metal strips fashioned into circular bands, fastened to internal leather straps. The overlapping rows or bands of solid armour plates are called lores in Murian. Chainmail. This is a full suit of chain armor made with riveted or welded rings, making the suit incredibly durable. The Hauberk covers both sleeves and stops at the knee, offering near complete coverage. Unfortunately, it is not silent in the least. Splint. Splint mail is made up of overlapping layers of metal strips attached to a backing of leather or sturdy fabric. These splints are of greater size and durability than those that compose a suit of scale mail, improving the protection they afford the wearer, but at the cost of ﬂexibility. A suit of splint mail includes gauntlets. Plate. The essential Knight’s armor. Plate is extremely difﬁcult and costly to produce, is the heaviest and most restrictive of all armor. However, no other armor is more protective. All parts of the body are covered, even the wearer’s joints. O-Yoroi. Also known as great armour, o-yoroi, is a full suit of armour formed from small metal plates tied together with coloured leather lacing and lacquered to seal them from moisture. The full suit consists of a corselet (do-maru, covering the stomach, chest, shoulders, and back), large rectangular shoulder pieces (sode), an apron of large plates to cover the thighs and knees (haidate), a great helmet with a face mask (kabuto), and shin guards made of metal splints (cuneate).  Wearing great armor is a badge of honour for noble caste, of the Celestial Empire and its adjoining states, and they frown on anyone else wearing a suit. Shields Shields come in a variety of shapes and sizes and are usually strapped to the forearm and gripped with the hand. Buckler. This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon  but if you do so, you lose the buckler’s Armor Class bonus until your next turn. Likewise, you can cast a spell with somatic components using your shield arm, but you lose the buckler’s Armor Class bonus until your next turn. A buckler can be used as a bludgeoning weapon. Shield. Shields come in a variety of shapes but are about the size of the user’s torso. You strap the shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand, or grasp it with a center grip, occupying your off hand. A shield is large enough to provide better passive protection than the buckler, while still providing the agility missing with a tower shield. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY

416 Tower Shield. The tower shield is large and cumbersome and does not provide any bonus to AC, however, as a bonus action, you can use a tower shield to grant you total cover until the beginning of your next turn. When using a tower shield in this way, you must choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total cover for attacks that pass through this edge and no cover for attacks that do not pass through this edge however you also negate any ﬂanking bonus an enemy might have on you. The shield does not provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. Chapter Six: Religion & Magic 417 Magic & Religion T here are hundreds of gods, goddesses and other power worshipped across Oerik. Over a hundred deities are worshipped in the Flanaess alone. Most can be divided into one of several sub-pantheons based on the peoples who originally worshipped them although many are now worshipped across ethnic groups forming a sort of common, uniﬁed pantheon that would be easily recognized by most inhabitants of the Flanaess. This mixed group of gods and goddesses is often referred to as the Greyhawk Pantheon. Elsewhere, like in Zahind, the Baklunish lands and Mur, their pantheons have remained largely unchanged by outside inﬂuence. Across most of Oerik most deities are worshipped individually, rather than as a group. The most common exceptions are the various racial pantheons, such as those of the dwur, olve, hobniz and noniz and The Celestial Bureaucracy of western Oerik. The four Oeridian gods of the seasons (Atroa, Sotillon, Wenta and Telchur) and the weather god Velnius are also often worshipped a group. Although many people worship a deity of their own racial or cultural pantheon, it is not unheard of for individuals to worship outside of this category. Many gods, such as the Flan sun deity Pelor, are popular among humans of all ethnic backgrounds. Some human deities, including Ehlonna, Ulaa, Fortubo, Jascar and Bleredd are popular among elves or dwarves, while the evil human gods Hextor, Erythnul, Nerull, Syrul and Beltar are worshipped by many orcs and goblinoids. Most people in the Flanaess pray or pay tribute to more than one deity, asking favour from each in some role of everyday life. Certain human kingdoms endorse or even require the worship of a speciﬁc deity.

Deities are divided into four groups: greater, intermediate, lesser, and demi- powers. The basis of this broad distinction is as follows:

Greater Powers: These are distant Powers, far removed from most mortal affairs. Some may be held to Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 418 Greyhawk Rebooted 576CY is unofﬁcial Fan Content permitted under the Fan WotC Content Policy. be among the Creator Powers of the multiverse or of Oerth. They typically have many spheres of concern, or are absolute masters of just one sphere.

Intermediate Powers: While lacking the great creative force of Greater Powers, they are still very powerful and hold major sway over one or two spheres of concern. In some nations, they may be held as patron Powers, even above a Greater Power.

Lesser Power. A lesser Power may serve greater ones as a messenger or aide, may be a cast-out or solitary Power, or may hold sway over a very narrow sphere of concern. Some Lesser Powers may be declining from exalted status or may be ascending to greater force.

Demi-powers: These are the least powerful and are in many ways similar to Lesser Powers. Some may be mortals who have undergone divine ascension (Zagyg and Murlynd being prime examples). Some may even be referred to as Hero Powers. Religion of the Flanaess The ancient Flan had a thoroughly animistic society. Besides their great gods like Obad-hai, Pelor and Beory, the druids of the Old Faith worshipped the spirits of trees, the moons, and the rivers. Many of the beings once worshipped as gods by the Flan still exist today in the form of nymphs, treants, and other faerie folk. Some of the old gods have been absorbed by the greater deities, while others have died from lack of worship, their corpses still and silent in the Astral Plane. At some point, thousands of years before the Twin Cataclysms and hundreds of years before the birth of Vecna, the Chapter Six: Religion & Magic 419 herdsman followers of the moon-god Rao in the Vale of Luna (modern day Veluna) migrated to the ﬁrst Flan city, Haradaragh, and the ﬁrst temple of wood and stone was constructed beginning Rao’s rise to prominence in the Flan pantheon and the foundation of the mixed Flan-Oeridian Church of Veluna. As the urbanization of Flan culture spread, new gods were added to the pantheon including Berei, Allitur, Myhriss and Zodal. Cults of Nerull also began to grow across the Flanaess at this time as well. Today, the Flan are still largely a druidic people who generally still exclusively worship their ancestral gods. This pantheon is known as The Old Kerk and across the central Flanaess, from Verbobonc to the Cairn Hills, it is practiced by many non-Flan as well. The Old Kerk

⎈Myhriss A New Syncretism The Great Migrations were a time of great religious change as thousands of Oeridian and Suel poured into the Flanaess, rewriting its ethnic paradigms. The Oeridians, as a migratory group from the plains to the west of the Barrier Peaks worshipped mainly gods of the winds and sky, of trade and travel. For the most part they honoured all of their gods equally. They had no formal temples, and so they would burn offerings to Celestian in the hope he would guide their dead to the afterworld, to Fharlanghn to guide their paths on Oerth, to the wind gods to ward off storms or celebrate the turning of the seasons, to Heironeous, Erythnul, and Hextor for victory in battle (though Heironeous and Hextor were rapidly eclipsing the old god Erythnul, whose worship saw more popularity in the Sheldomar Valley than further east), to Zilchus in the hope of gaining wealth, status, and prosperity and to his dark brother Kurell in the hope of taking vengeance for that which was unjustly denied them. Wherever they went they brought with them their great revelation, the Prophesies of Johydee named for the ancient queen who inspired them to travel to the edge of the eastern sea, they were initially written on the inside of Johydee’s famous Mask. The Velunese Church The Prophesies of Johydee form the foundation of the Church of Veluna and they remained a crucial part of Oeridian holy texts, included among most of them to this day. Traditionally they begin with Johydee singing of creation itself, portraying the creation of the world as a process of revelation, with ﬁrst light obscuring everything and then darkness. The details and interpretation of this vary from sect to sect. Only when a seer was born among the gods is creation able to be perceived. The gods in the Prophecies are named only as the Twelve, and arguments over which twelve gods Johydee was referring to, and who the Seer was, have raged ever since. Of the Oeridian churches, it has the fewest number of gods beyond the traditional Oerdian pantheon. The text went on to describe Johydee’s liberation of the Oeridian people from the tyranny of evil/ignorant deities/ malevolent forces (again, the details vary) and the establishment of her own government of justice. The ﬁnal part of the text are the prophesies themselves, in which Johydee predicts the establishment of a permanent empire where the Oeridians can dwell in safety and enlightenment on the shore where the sun rises. While this was taken by the Aerdi to

A few heretics, not least among them Johydee’s own priesthood, claim the whole book is only a parable that masks the truth of the story, which is an allegory for the process of enlightenment from ignorance. The Cuthbertines One of the greatest evangelists of the Velunese Church was the legendary St. Cuthbert. While the precise time of his mortal life are lost, St. Cuthbert’s teachings—a stern yet practical synthesis of the Oeridian concept of the Twelve and the Flan deity Rao—are well-remembered, faithfully written down in tracts and tomes throughout the central Flanaess. It is St. Cuthbert’s version of the growing multi- ethnic faith of the post-migration period that has become the most popular religion among the commoners of Verbobonc, Greyhawk, Dyvers, the Wild Coast, and Urnst states, and he is the chief reason for the power and status of the Canon of Mitrik in the hearts of thousands of faithful. St. Cuthbert never sought to deny the other gods, and his followers commonly revere many like-minded deities as their version of the mythical Twelve, even including shrines to them in St. Cuthbert’s temples. Rao in particular, thought be some to have been St. Cuthbert’s speciﬁc patron, is greatly honoured by Cuthbertines. The Velunese Pantheon The Twelve

⎈Hextor The Sectarian Sheldomar In the Sheldomar Valley the Oeridians merged (for the most part) peaceably with the Suloise, who brought the pantheon of their ancient, alien empire with them. The Prophecies of Johydee were interpreted to mean an empire that reached the Azure Sea, from which the rising sun was certainly visible, and the mysterious Twelve were enumerated to include Suel deities as well as Oeridian ones. Religion in Keoland has always been a relatively chaotic affair, as the founders of the nation decreed that sectarian rivalries between the feuding Suel houses and incoming Oeridian tribes meant there would be no national church. As a result, each local temple has come to deﬁne the cosmology for itself. Religion is mainly a local affair in Keoland, although adherents of the northern Church of Veluna are permitted to practice their faith in Keoland unmolested. While Suel gods have always been popular in Keoland, their theology was greatly restructured along Oeridian lines, inspired by the Prophecies. Elsewhere on the Flanaess much of the same evolution has taken place, with the rigid Suloise theogony hybridized with Oeridian and Flan ideas and myths. Only in the isolated Tilvanot peninsula has the classical Suloise mythological system been left more or less intact, though Pyremius and Syrul are given a far higher place in that nation’s religion than they had been given in the ancient Suloise Imperium, and the evolution of Wee Jas from the goddess of magic to the goddess of magic and death has proceeded even there, inspired in part by the great death inﬂicted by the magical Rain of Colourless Fire. Residents of the Sheldomar Valley worship a wide array of gods and goddesses and one can ﬁnd followers of any Flan, Oeridian or Suloise deity in this region and the Baklunish gods, while less welcome, are not unheard of either. This trend extends as far away from Keoland as Bissel, the Ulek states, the Wild Coast and the Domain of Greyhawk. Medegian Church In the eastern Flanaess, where the Aerdi founded their Great Kingdom, religion has always been much more hierarchical and statist. When Prince Mikar of Rel Astra conquered the Medegian Bladelands, the resulting Kingdom of Aerdy was decreed the fulﬁlment of Johydee’s prophecy and Medegia was declared the Holy See where all true doctrine would be set. Subsequent Holy Censors of Medegia redeﬁned the true doctrine that all churches of the Great Kingdom would be required to adopt: in 1 CY, the Holy Censor Paulianus identiﬁed Pholtus as the Seer of Johydee’s prophecies, who ﬁrst identiﬁed Creation in the midst of the Blinding Light. While many deities were tolerated in the Great Church, those clerics who did not conform to the doctrine as it was established in Medegia were stamped out as heretics by imperial troops. The pantheon of the Twelve, and associated lesser deities who acted as servants of the Twelve, was envisioned as a celestial template of the Overking’s own court with its own squabbles and intrigues much as the court in Rauxes had, much like the

The greatest holy book in the early Medegian Church  is known as the Tome of the True Gods. Written by the corpulent priest Embrosius, this work collected four previous books, ﬁrst among them the Prophecies of Johydee. The second book in the Codex was the ancient Oeridian Song of the Primordials, which told of the war between the gods of Order and the gods of Chaos at the beginning of time. This work was not alluded to in the Prophecies and likely represented a separate tradition, though Embrosius did his best to reconcile the two. The third book in the Tome was the Book of Creation. This is the oldest and most sacred text of the Ahlissan Flan, a hauntingly enigmatic series of images that appears in every divine Manual of Golems to this day. Embrosius, very daringly for his era, works this as well into what is otherwise primarily a work based on Oeridian scriptures. He does not do the same for other Ahlissan Flan holy texts, however. The last part of the Tome of True Gods was Embrosius’s masterwork, The Theogony. This is a genealogy of the gods, tracing the origins of gods and primordials back to primal Chaos and the deiﬁed personiﬁcations of abstract concepts. There is only a single pantheon in Embrosius’s vision, with twelve greater gods ruling all the others. The gods of other races were decreed to be mere aspects of the gods of the Aerdi, which simpliﬁed the myth tremendously. The Medegian Pantheon The Twelve

Immediately the new Holy Censor declared Zilchus, the Divine Prince, to be the Divine Overking, the ruler of all the gods just as the Overking in Rauxes was the ruler of all humanity. Many of Pholtus’s faithful, not willing to take the reduction of the status of Divine Seer lying down, migrated north to the shadow of the Rakers, where without priests of other deities clamouring for attention their beliefs grew more and more Pholtus-centric, denouncing all

(another group of heretical Pholtan’s migrated far to the west and are said to have established a colony in the Tyurzi Mountains). Embrosius’s Tome of the True Gods fell victim to this religious upheaval. The original version gave too much credit to Pholtus and not enough to Zilchus for the new Holy Censor’s taste, while for the tastes of the new Pholtans of the Pale, the Tome was far too polytheistic, with too much credit given to gods that were not Pholtus and not enough credit to Pholtus as the only god that mattered. While most subsequent holy books owed something of a debt to Embrosius’s Tome, the Theogony chapter was revised heavily by both groups and decreed a new, superior revelation. The Almoran Reformation In 356 CY the second and most signiﬁcant division of the Medegian Church occurred when Nyrond seceded from the Great Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 424 Kingdom, taking with it the clerical ﬁef of Almor. While ruled by clerics, Almor had long languished in the shadow of Medegia, but with the establishment of Nyrond as an independent kingdom it suddenly saw the opportunity to become a major force for religious doctrine in its own right. Pelor was identiﬁed as the Divine Prelate of the Twelve, and Heironeous as the Divine King. The editor of the new Almorian Book of True Gods, which was named simply The Pantheon to avoid confusion with false Medegian texts, was a prelate named Anda, and she is perhaps one of the most inﬂuential theologians of the modern era. Anda, a stout, gregarious woman, consulted many works that weren’t known to Embrosius or his successors, visiting the priests of the elves, dwarves, halﬂings, and gnomes in order to create a work with far less syncretism than the original. Anda’s work portrays the gods as belonging to many different families corresponding to the pantheons of various human and nonhuman peoples, all descended from the goddess Beory, who personiﬁes the Oerth. Beory is one of twelve original divine beings, the others personifying Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Life, Death, Good, Evil, Law, Chaos, the Astral, and the Ethereal. Anda strove to remain as faithful as possible to the scriptures of nonhuman peoples, and it is from Chapter Six: Religion & Magic 425 this work that such myths as the battle between Corellon Larethian and Gruumsh entered human lore (Embrosius had made it a battle between Hextor and Erythnul, thereby distorting it considerably). The pantheons described in this Second Almorian Codex include the elven, dwarven, halﬂing, gnomish, Baklunish, Oerid, Flan, Suel, orc, goblin, and giant. Deities of the underdark races were apparently not known to Anda, and the only draconic deities mentioned are Bahamut and Tiamat. The Touv and Olman pantheons are also not mentioned. While this work has been widely circulated and is used by priests of many different faiths, it is not without its critics, and it has not become universally adopted in the central Flanaess or the Sheldomar, where religion is much more ﬂuid than in the hierarchical Great Kingdom. Anda’s respect for the myths described were such that high elves and hill dwarves are mostly satisﬁed with the treatment of their faiths, although more isolated demi-human peoples often reject its implication that the gods of other races are equally important. Hextorian Schism The next upheaval in Medegia came when Ivid I removing the priesthood of Zilchus from the Holy Censorship in 450 CY, replacing them with the clerics of the Divine Warlord, Hextor, subsequently decreeing that Hextor was the true Divine Overking and that Zilchus was merely the Divine Merchant Lord. Since that time, the heavy hand of the Church of Hextor has dominated religious life in the Great Kingdom. Suloise Pantheon

The Suel pantheon is not nearly as widely worshipped as the more common syncretic Oeridian faith. In regions where there are still Suel minorities; the Urnst states, Keoland, etc., the Suel pantheon does still have adherents. Elsewhere, as previously discussed, Suel gods and goddesses have gained non-Suel adherents as they have been absorbed into a common syncretic pantheon. The Suloise people tend to be as respectful of their gods as they are of their ancestors. On the Thillonrian Peninsula, a new Suloise god has entered the pantheon: Vatun, who receives considerable worship, though Kord, Llerg, Norebo and Xerbo are also worshipped. In the Amedio Jungle and the continent of Hepmonaland, the Suloise residents worship Llerg, Beltar, Bralm, Phaulkon, Pyremius, Wastri, and Xerbo, with a small number of them worshipping Wee Jas. On the Tilvanot Peninsula the entire Suloise Pantheon receives dutiful worship, although Lendor, Bralm, Pyremius, Lydia, Osprem, Syrul, and Wee Jas can lay claim to the largest followings. It has been rumoured that the Scarlet Brotherhood worships dark gods, such as Tharizdun, though this is doubtful. The gods of the old Suel colonial authorities in Zahind have been completely abandoned but many still worship this pantheon along the Sunelan Coast.

The Baklunish, unlike the Suloise, retained much of their culture after the fall of their empire. The Baklunish tribes who settled on the Dramidj coast and environs brought with them a polytheistic religion where oerth and sky and all of the elements are sacred. There are no temples or churches in Baklunish lands (although monasteries to Xan Yae and Zuoken exist, a custom imported from the west). Instead burnt offerings are offered to the gods on altars under the open sky. They offer sacriﬁces to four main “good” deities who are seen as aspects of one unifying force known as Istus, Lady of Fate. The four high gods of the Bakluni are: Geshtai, goddess of rain, rivers and wells, representing elemental water; Atar, god of the Sun, representing elemental ﬁre; Suwat, god of mountains, metals and stone, representing elemental earth; Waadi, goddess of the moon, sky and wind, representing elemental air. These (and other) forces of good stand in opposition to the evil spirit of Dorgha Torgu, thought by some eastern sages to be one and the same as the Elder Elemental Eye, and his forces. The nomadic Paynim tribes and their descendants, the Wolf and Tiger nomads, have a much less formal approach to religion, revering a mix of elemental lords, ancestral spirits, and deities, although many of the Paynims treat the Tubrat as their most sacred text.

⎈Suwat The Celestial Bureaucracy In ancient times, the Suhfeng worshipped a pantheon of gods not unlike those of the Suel or Oeridans however these gods were abandoned during the long centuries of the Demon Wars. As the myriad Suhfeng petty-states coalesced into the colossal Celestial Empire, many began to see some of the more powerful celestials who had aided the Suhfeng, and their Spirit Folk and Yokai allies in turning back the demonic and bakemono hordes, as gods themselves. Thus began an evolution of religion in western Oerik whereby the people pray to innumerable celestial beings that comprise, what has come to be known as, the Celestial Bureaucracy. The empyrean Jiao travelled to the upper planes and brokered a deal with nine gods and goddesses of justice and law. This celestial contract saw Jiao deiﬁed as a demi-god so that he may channel all worship of the Celestial Bureaucracy to these Nine Immortals who i n turn grant divine powers to priests of the Celestial Bureaucracy. Jiao also agreed to the tenets of the Nine Immortals and with red lighting, he blasted these into the sheer granite of the Cliffs of To-Vulin where the inscriptions stand to current times. The identity of the nine immortals is unknown to mortals on Oerth but the tenets of the Celestial Bureaucracy are:

❉Honour that which has gone before you. For the past is eternal.

❉Honour and respect your Elders and the Ancestors. Show honour in word, thought, action and deed.

❉Speak not false words, nor engage in false deeds.

⎈Tensi

⎈Waadi

⎈Xan Yae

⎈Zuoken Chapter Six: Religion & Magic 427

❉Do honour to he who rules you, for the Oerth is the mirror of Heaven, and the Celestial Emperor is the mirror of the Nine. Be obedient to your Emperor and his agents.

❉Engage in no base thing, nor commit murder, nor strike another in the name of anger.

❉Do honour to those you must rule, for under the eye of Heaven, they are your equals. Be fair to those you rule.

❉Know that all things are One under Heaven, even the lowliest of creatures. The average citizen of the Celestial Empire does not attend a church or temple on a regular basis, indeed the concept of a church as a separate entity clearly identiﬁed from all others is somewhat strange to those in western Oerik. For the Suhfeng, religion organized on such a scale does not exist. However, this does not mean the average person is not pious and respectful of religion, nor that the shrines and monasteries are in total anarchy. It is just that the attitude toward religion is vastly different. The Suhfeng are supreme spiritual generalists; they recognize that survival in the spiritual world depends on knowing what celestial exempliﬁes which traits, and which spirit to appease when. They will rise in the morning to burn incense to Mi Ling, the Ki-Rin who is known for her compassion, invoke the name of the great Foo Lion Gy-Tao when they are frightened or amazed, and pray to the nature spirits of air and water for a good catch when they are ﬁshing. Atonement for transgressions involves sacriﬁce of valuable items, although particularly heinous crimes may require the death of the sinner to atone. Clerics of the Celestial Bureaucracy may pray to various gods and spirits depending on the speciﬁc need but they gain their divine powers through the collective of celestials that make up the pantheon as whole, including the deiﬁed Celestial Emperor himself. They may choose from the Life, Order, or Protection domains. The Way

Some 2500 years ago, some Suhfeng began to chafe at the benevolent yet strict laws that governed their lives as citizens of the Celestial Empire. In that year a woman named Xan-Yae communed alone for 40 days with the Mist Dragon, Xinapheranak, who disclosed to her a new way forward for the Suhfeng people; one in which they were the architects of their own fate and not merely wards or playthings for outsiders, be they demon or celestial.  Xan-Yae preached a doctrine of self-reliance and self-exploration for a release of power from within. Followers of The Way believe that reality depends upon three metaphysical ideals: the Universal Mind (the universe and all Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 428 things in it exist because the mind created them and maintain them), the Perpetual Harmony (life is balanced, symmetry is in all things, achieving a similar state puts one in harmony with nature), and Internal Peace (martial and mental activities must be mastered to attain a higher level of existence). Flamboyance and wasted energy have no place in the The Way. The extremes of evil and good must be sought out and tempered with harmony to maintain balance. Clerics of the Way are agents of harmony and discipline. They seek out radical factions and politics and bend them toward balance. They train others in the simple arts of war, hone the minds of those open to mental challenges, scour the world to ﬁnd evidence of the Universal Mind, and seek gurus of advanced physical and mental abilities for knowledge of self- elevation. They are not passive beings, but actively seek change to ensure the stability of the universe. Seeing the Celestial Empire as being out of balance, Wayists began preaching secession and rebellion within the Empire. Xan-Yae herself travelled deep into the Tyurzi Mountains where she established a monastery in the land of Be’how and there in -1,986 CY, after 364 days of uninterrupted meditation, she penned the 36 scrolls that make up the tenets of The Way and faded away in front of her disciples; Xan-Yae had achieved apotheosis. The people of Be’how, under the leadership of the High Speaker of the Way immediately seceded from the Celestial Empire and declared neutrality to all other nations, in all conﬂicts, in all times. The native Goliath population quickly took to the new faith and are today among its most devout followers. (The current High Speaker in 576 CY is  the goliath, Ugyen Wangdi) Within a few centuries, The Way had spread across the entirety of the Celestial Empire. It took root most ﬁrmly on the edges of the Empire where several local lords began establishing their own demesnes outside the control of the Empire. Today the faith has not been outlawed within the Empire but its followers are generally looked down upon as troublemakers and often discriminated against by the Celestial bureaucracy. Murian Pantheon Mur was settled over eight thousand years ago by the Su-el people who spent generations wandering as refugees from the destruction of the Empire of Zarum. They eventually settled along the northern coasts of the Gulf of Ghayar and these settlements grew into towns as the people began to accumulate wealth and craft luxury goods. Their gods included Lendor and Llerg, Wee Jas and Osprem, and other, familiar, gods of the later Suel Imperium. Over time the new wealth of the Su-el towns attracted raiders from the Flame Desert, early ancestors of the Baklunish peoples.  These raids gradually turned into a full ﬂedged, generational invasion by hordes of proto-Baklunish. Many Su- Chapter Six: Religion & Magic 429 el settlements were put to the torch but most were captured intact, their peoples either driven out or enslaved as the invaders settled into an agrarian, urban lifestyle themsleves. As the proto-Baklunish rulers and their mostly Su-el subjects blended over time, a new, distinctly Murian culture arose. A superstitious people, the proto-Baklunish leadership were animists and they banned the worship of the old Su-el gods and even the knowledge of their existence eventually disappeared, their worshippers long having ﬂed Mur as refugees from the initial invasion. (Note: They will later go on to form one of the mightiest empires in Oerik history!) Several minor Suel gods and goddess were not content with the fate that had befallen their worshippers in Mur and chose to intercede directly in the affairs of the Murians, promoting Su-el traditions and culture wherever possible.  This displeased Lendor who demoted these rebellious deities and banished them to the Prime Material, forever banning them from taking up residence in the upper planes. Thus twelve lesser Suel deities were relegated to demi-god status and they structured themselves into the current Murian pantheon on Oerik. The Murian gods and goddesses have powers, abilities, and qualities totally unavailable to the mortal-born. The Murian gods aren’t omnipotent or omniscient although they are physically and magically powerful, ageless, and all but indestructible, their actions are bound by the decree of Lendor.  They are able to hear the prayers of their worshippers and do grant divine powers to their clerics. The pantheon is led by Krenor, the demi- god of intrigue, politics and diplomacy. Although technically a demi god, Krenor is the most powerful of the Murian gods by a wide margin, his powers rivalling those of a lesser gods. The home of the gods is located high above the cloud line of Mount Zorn in central Mur. Among this great complex, usually beyond the reach of mortals, can be found the mansions and castles of most of the pantheon with the exception of Pythas, who dwells in a deep cavern complex deep beneath the roots of Mount Zorn with his wife Pentlin. The Murian gods generally have egos proportionate with their power and importance. Most simply will not stand for mere mortals behaving beyond their station, e.g., treating gods as equals, or not showing proper respect in other ways. Attempting to coerce or intimidate a god in some way will nearly always result in divine punishment. Mortals who meddle with the gods are usually dealt with harshly in order to provide examples for others who may contemplate such actions.

The Olman pantheon has changed considerably over time, and which gods are included, and which is considered the head of the pantheon, vary considerably even between tribes today. It could be argued that time itself is the supreme god of the Olman pantheon as the intricate calendars of the Olman rose from, and then directed, the religious beliefs. The religion of the Olman  infuses every aspect of their civilization from their architecture, to their dress and personal appearance, their calendar, and even their sports. The Olman believe that the gods, though living high in the mists of

The jungles which ringed their cities were inhabited by spirits and by the great god of the woods, Apocatequil the dark spirit of the jungle itself. The cities themselves each had a patron god who made the city thrive by accepting the invitation to residence in the central temple. When the rains came, it is because the god Tlatlan is pleased and when the lightning ﬂashed it was the work of the lord Yaluk. In days gone by it is said that each year, at the spring and autumn equinox, the great god Kulkatlan descended from the sky down the staircase of his temple at Tamaochan as was (and is still) clearly recognized by the shadow the serpent god moving down the steps to meet the stone heads at the base.  The whole of the earth, and human life, is imbued with spiritual forces which need to be recognized, honoured, and regularly consulted in order for the community and the individual to prosper. The Olman of the Tilvanot Peninsula worship at least six deities: Zoztzl, god of the underworld; Coatlhue, goddess of plants and the earth; Kulkatlan, god of birds and magic; Yalak, god of the seas; Tlatlan, goddess of rain; Xelan goddess of power and legal tradition The Olman of the Sea Princes and Olman Isles  almost exclusively revere Kulkatlan or Pacal.

Sunelan religion encompasses the indigenous religious beliefs and practices of the native islanders with the Suel gods of the old imperial ruling class of the region. It is both polytheistic and animistic, with a belief in many deities and spirits, including the belief that spirits are found in non-human beings and objects such as animals, the waves, and the sky. Just like the people of this region, the Sunelan pantheon is a mixture of the Suel pantheon with the old Sunelan gods. In some cases, the Suel gods maintain their Suel names while in others Suel gods are known by Sunelan names. Sunelan clerics are known as Kahun, and they are well respected in Sunelan culture. The most popular god on the mainland is Zaliira, the old Suel goddess of truth, balance and vengeance and her worship has been popular since the uprising after the Twin Cataclysms that removed the Suel from their lofty positions of power and authority over the indigenous population. Out in the archipelago, the old traditional gods tend to be more popular however the old Suel gods Osprem and Xerbo are highly revered under their Sunelan names of Oa’pema (Osprem) and Tagaroa (Xerbo) where they are worshipped as the benevolent and wrathful natures of the oceans. Of particular note is the cult of Mawui who was a mortal cleric of Zaliira during the trying times of the Twin Cataclysms. Mawui, with the divine guidance of Zaliira led the slave rebellion responsible for the raising of the Summer Palace  and ending the rule of the last emperor of the Suel Imperium. Today Mawui is perhaps the most popualr deity of the common people of the Sunelan Coast.

⎈Lono Touv Pantheon

The Touv pantheon is an ancient one, believed by its adherents to go back to a time before the Touv had even settled in Hepmonaland. These people believe that in the beginning, before the coming of the Touv, the land of Hepmonaland was lonely and had no soul. Everything that was, plants, animals, birds and ﬁsh were alone until Uvot rose to become it’s soul. His ﬁrst actions were ones of thanks; thanks to the sunlight for helping give him life, and thanks to the rain, that nourished the land from which he had sprung. Thus were born Nola and Vogun, spirits of the sun and rain, respectively. Nola and Vogun knew one another, and from their union sprang Breeka, Lady of beasts and plants. From Breeka was born Katay, spirit of death, rot and time. At about this time, Uvot knew Nola, and Xanag, the Metal Spirit was born soon afterwards. Vogun was quickly enchanted by Xanag, and after their union she gave birth to Kundo the Builder, who gave thanks to all the spirits who had come before by creating music to honour them. Chosok the warrior soon followed from that same union, and it fell to him to teach the Touv the arts of war. Kundo hung the moons in the sky to honour his mother and grandmother, so that Nola’s light would never be truly absent from the skies. On the ﬁrst night of the world, as Breeka slept, Meyanok the Serpent issued forth from

Jealous of the others, and resentful that Nola did not shine upon him as she had the others, he laid three eggs of his own, children who would aid him against the others. The ﬁrst egg to hatch revealed Vara, the night terror; Damaran the vermin crawler, and Berna the vendetta. Meyanok sent his young to do his bidding, with Vara visiting Grandmother Breeka ﬁrst. Taken unawares, Breeka was overcome with terror, and in her fear she spawned all the creatures who make the night a dangerous place. Damaran was sent to Kundo, and infested his buildings with biting insects, though he always ﬂed before Kundo could confront him. Berna was sent to slay Xanag, but was so awed by the Spirit of Metal that with Xanag’s help, she overcame her low beginnings and  became the Spirit of Passion she is today. In the earliest days, one rose from the obscurity of the mortal realms to join the gods. Lodot had sought mastery of the mysteries of the world, and in his wanderings had mastered both magic and luck. Uvot welcomed the late- coming child with open arms, as he has all mortals since who have transcended their beginnings.

In Zahind, it seems that every boulder or stream has an associated god or goddess and all are part of a Great Cosmic Wheel (see DM’s Guide to Oerik). The Zahindian pantheon is vast but hierarchical like Zahind culture. At its top is a sort of King of the Gods, the tiger god, Rajanash. Below him is his enforcer the dragon god, Safeer. Finally, there is Ganara, the elephant god and advisor to the King. These three make up the ruling triumvirate. Beneath them in a complex web of domains and inﬂuences with literally dozens and dozens of lesser deities and demi-gods not to mention hero-gods and other immortals. Some of the more popular are Sinda, the avenger god of war, Ganapati, the monkey-god of mischief and riddles, Sivatna, the shark god of the rain and the sea, and many others. It should be noted that a great many of the Zahindian deities have animal aspects, a trait scholars believe trace their origins back to the Zarumite Empire.

576CY 438 MAGIC To appreciate how people of the Oerik, both on the surface and in the UnderOerth, perceive magic and why they are generally so fearful of it, it is necessary to understand how magic has been used in both the past and present as a tool of terror, cruelty, and subjugation. Magic is power in the World of Greyhawk, and power tends to corrupt. It is this tendency towards corruption that people of the Oerik fear most. Magic might have its uses, but the examples of its use for the beneﬁt of people are far outweighed by those of its use to harm, intimidate, and control. Many centuries ago, magic was the primary tool of nefarious despots who ruled over enormous empires. The ancient Ur sorcerers of the Flan, most notable among them Vecna, mastered necromancy and used it to create undead abominations to conquer and control vast populations. Those who did not succumb to the will of the Ur were often slain with magic spells then animated as undead to serve dutifully. The Flan people of ancient times abhorred this practice, and in time managed to overthrow their oppressive necromancer rulers and erase many of the most powerful necromantic magics from history so that they might never be used again. Meanwhile in the UnderOerth, the drow utilized the same necromantic magic to craft some of the most horriﬁc undead ever known. Though the means to create these horrors was lost in devastating drow wars, the creations remained, some of them self-propagating, their victims joining them in unlife. In western Oerik, there is a generational memory of the great Demon Wars that saw the vast lands that are today the Celestial Empire riven by conﬂict fanned and fought byt ﬁendish forces from the abyss Chapter Six: Religion & Magic 439 against goodly forces of humans, spirit folk, olve and others backed by celstials from the upper planes. Perhaps the most momentous use of magic ever to occur on Oerik was the raising of the Demon Wall by the empyrean Jiao that ended that great conﬂict. To this day magic is highly regulated across Suhfeng lands and its practitioners  tend to be avoided by common people whnever possible.  Few Suhfeng truly truat any form of arcane magic. Next came the Baklunish-Suloise Wars. The Baklunish Empire and the Suel Imperium fought against each other for decades, honing their battle magic and raining down destruction upon each other. But their spell-work on the battleﬁeld was nothing compared to the Twin Cataclysms: the Invoked Devastation which destroyed the Baklunish Empire and the Rain of Colorless Fire which reduced the Suel Imperium to ash. These indiscriminate magics of war decimated entire populations of innocent people. They are still cited today as among the chief dangers of magic. As the surviving Suloise people ﬂed from their burning land, some travelled through the UnderOerth for long periods, coming into contact with the drow. The worst magic of the two peoples was occasionally exchanged, and the drow, long-time ﬁend worshippers, enriched their ties to other dark entities such as the Elder Elemental God. House Eilservs of Erelhei-Cinlu would eventually come to worship the Elder Elemental God almost exclusively, and this would lead to an arrangement between the drow and evil people on the surface which would spell yet another disaster for the the Flanaess region of Oerik, the rise of Elemental Evil. There are also modern threats that magic poses to the people of Oerth. The evil demigod Iuz rules over a worldly realm in the northern Flanaess, using mortal wizards and clerics known as the Boneheart to do his bidding. In the east, the Great Kingdom is ruled by the decadent House Rax which presides over what is now known as the Fiend-Seeing Throne. The ﬁends which serve Rax are brought to Oerth using magic devised by some of the most nefarious conjurers ever seen. Even the majestic City of Greyhawk is haunted by the arcane experiments of the mad archmage Zagig Yragerne. Magic is common place and less feared in the Touv lands of Hepmonaland and nearly all those in leadership roles in Touv culture have some spellcasting ability. Likewise, magic is quite common in Zahind lands although here it is greatly feared.  Humans are effectively forbidden from learning magic in  the Zahind lands ruled by nagas, rakshasha and other evil beings. For every positive effect magic has had on the lives of common people, they can usually name at least ten negative effects. This is just as true in the Underoerth, where the most feared creatures are not monsters, but drow mages and priests who serve demons and other fell powers. So it is that magic is generally viewed in a very dark light across most of Oerik. It is seen primarily as a tool to animate undead, a way to destroy things, and a means to summon ﬁends. Compared to these, the beneﬁts of magic seem relatively inconsequential. Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 440 Artificer Spells

Acid Spheres 5th level conjuration (sorcerer, wizard) Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S Duration: 10 minutes By means of this spell, you conjure spheres of acid that hover around you. Any time a creature within 10’ of you casts a spell at you or attacks you, you may use your reaction to have one of the spheres attack the target. Make a ranged spell attack at the creature.

The DC to break free of your webs increases by 1 for every 2 slot levels above 4th. Act of God 9th level abjuration (cleric) Casting Time: 1 reaction Range: Self Components: M, V Duration: Instantaneous You use your reaction to cast this spell by clutching you holy symbol and crying out your deity’s name when terrible misfortune, including death, strikes you. All spells, conditions and effects on you end except those you wish to continue, and you are healed to half your maximum New Spells Chapter Six: Religion & Magic 445 hit points.

The force assumes a cylindrical shape 12 feet long by 2 feet in diameter, but the caster can shorten its length to 3 feet in order to ﬁt in a cramped space.  The force acts as a battering ram Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 446 of great power. Treat it as a battering ram that can be directed by the caster. Only one attack can be made per round and all attack rolls against normal objects are made with advantage. Used against a smaller physical obstruction, such as a dungeon door or metal grate reinforced with magic, a spell attack roll versus the save DC of the mage who cast the reinforcing spell on the door. If the attack misses, the gauntlet spell is destroyed. Against a living target, the ram has no effect. The caster must always remain within 60 feet of the ram or it will dissipate. The ram has 40 hit points, and an AC of 16.  It is immune to non-magical damage. Dispel magic spells can also destroy the gauntlet.

Bigby’s Construction Crew 4th level evocation (artiﬁcer, wizard) Casting Time: 1 action Range: 150 feet Components: V S M (an assortment of miniature tools worth 500 gp) Duration: 12 hours This spell creates a dozen pairs of hands. All of the hands come equipped with tools shaped of force and speciﬁc to the task the caster is evoking the hands for. The hands do the work of a construction team equal in ability to any crew of professional carpenters, masons, miners, or sappers. The hands never need to rest or eat. Each pair performs as one worker. They are unable to ﬁght or inﬂict physical damage on anything. Each pair of hands has an AC of 14, 20 hit points and resistance to non-magical damage. Bigby’s Feeling Fingers 1st level evocation  (artiﬁcer, wizard) Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S, M (a child sized silk glove and a swan feather) Duration:  1 hour This spell calls into existence a disembodied hand under the caster’s command. The hand cannot hold, grasp, or carry, but it does have an amazingly sensitive sense of touch. The hand’s sense of touch is so ﬁne that it can note minuscule cracks, separations, or openings in a surface, and thus grants advantage to any checks to detect secret doors. The hand can search a 5 foot by 5 foot area each round. The hand cannot be destroyed by physical attacks, but it is dispelled if dealt four or more points of magical damage. The hand can trip a non- magical trap if the location of the trap is known. Chapter Six: Religion & Magic 447 Bigby’s Dextrous Digits 2nd level evocation (artiﬁcer, wizard) Casting Time: 1 action Range: 90 feet Components: V, S, M Duration:  Concentration, 1minute/level This spell summons into existence a pair of disembodied hands that will follow the mage’s every order. The hands can perform all the functions of an unseen servant, but can also accomplish deeds requiring ﬁne coordination, such as tinkering with tools, working with laboratory equipment, sculpting, painting, or playing a musical instrument. The hands can perform any task the caster can accomplish and will perform with a dexterity equal to that of the caster. Each hand can hold and carry up to 15 lbs individually, or 30 lbs together. The hands can move no farther apart than the caster’s own hands. The hands have a speed of 60 feet, regardless of weight carried, but can move no farther than 90 feet away from the caster or they vanish. The hands cannot act out the somatic component of a spell. The hands cannot wield a weapon in melee or punch or grapple. Although the hands are immune to physical attacks, they can be dispelled. The material component is a pair of gloves embroidered with the mage’s initials. Bigby’s Force Sculpture 4th level evocation (artiﬁcer, wizard) Casting Time: 1 action Range: 90 feet Components: V S M (a lump of soft clay mixed with diamond dust worth 100 gp per level of spell slot used) Duration: 2 hours This spell enables the mage to create a visible plane of force that can be shaped into any form the caster wishes. The sum of the height, width, and depth of the shaped object cannot exceed 20 feet. The caster could create a table, ladder, club, bucket, stilts, or cane, for example. Once an object is formed, it retains its form for the duration of the spell. The object imitated must be fairly rigid, can have no moving parts, cannot have a sharp point or edge, and cannot possess ﬁnely detailed features. For example, a rope, long bow, sword, chariot, or accurate statue cannot be created with the spell. The object has an AC of 12, 30 hit points, and resistance to non-magical damage. At Higher Levels. If cast using a slot of 5th level or higher, the total dimensions of the object increase by 10 feet for each level above 4th and the duration increases by 1 hour for each level above 4th.

If cast using a slot of 5th level or higher, the object or objects formed from force can be more complex, composed of large, moving parts, have an edge or point, or be as ﬂexible as a rope or a bow. A wagon, quiver of quarrels, shovel, sword, or water wheel could all be simulated. Fine details can be worked into an object, provided the caster has sufﬁcient skill as an artisan or sculptor. Fine details take 1 minute to place on an object, but remain for the duration of the spell. Bigby’s Silencing Hand 2nd level evocation (bard, wizard) Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V S M (a cloth glove smeared with sticky syrup or honey) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute This spell creates an appropriately sized hand that will ﬂy toward the chosen creature and clamp tightly over the creature’s mouth unless the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature affected by the spell will be unable to talk clearly, cannot cast any spell requiring a verbal component, or use a magical item triggered by an audible command word. At the end of each of the creatures turns, Greyhawk Rebooted - 576CY 448 the creature can take a Strength saving throw to try and pry the hand off of their mouth which ends the spell.  The hand can also be destroyed by six or more points of magical damage, although most magical attacks carry the risk of harming the affected creature. Blackmantle 6th level necromancy (warlock, wizard) (ritual) Casting Time: 1 action Range: 150 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour This spell creates a shimmering dark haze in the air in a 50’ cube centered on a point you can see in range. Within that cube, creatures cannot regain hit points, gain temporary hit points or increase their hit point maximums. Brittlesteel 5thlevel transmutation (artiﬁcer, sorcerer, wizard) Casting Time: 1 action Range: 100 feet Components: V, S, M (a small piece of glass) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute This spell causes your foes’ weapons, excluding natural weapons, to weaken and become less effective, as if they were brittle glass. Choose up to ﬁve targets in range, each of which must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, whenever the target hits with an attack, it must roll damage twice and take the lower result. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Call Upon Faith 2nd level transmutation (cleric) Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: Self Components: V, S Duration: 1 round You call upon your faith to grant you success. As long as the spell lasts, you have advantage on all ability checks, though not attacks or saves. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature or increase the duration by one round for each level of the slot above 2nd. If you choose to affect additional targets, each one must be within 30’ of you. Chance’s Grace 2nd-level transmutation (cleric, bard) Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S, M Duration: Concentration, up to 4 hours You call upon the power of luck to protect you from ill fortune. While affected by this spell, cannot be affected by disadvantage and you don’t have to roll an extra die due to disadvantage. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a slot of 4th level or higher, the maximum duration increases. If you use a 4th level slot,  up to 10 minutes; if you use a 6th level slot, it lasts up to 1 hour; and if you use an 8th level slot, it lasts up to 4 hours. Charm of the Defender 4thlevel enchantment (cleric, paladin) Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120’ Components: V, S, M Duration: 1 minute Choose one creature within range when you cast this spell.

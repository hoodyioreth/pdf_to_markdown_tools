## Sail­

## ors on the Starless Sea

## of the Moathouse. The dungeon levels depart radically

## (conjuring, instead, Erol Otus's illustration in the Ba­

## sic D&D rulebook) but the surface layout resembles

## the Tl fortification if it had been rotted out from the

## inside, collapsing under its own weight and the raw ma­

## levolence of chaos.

## The homage is so palpable that Clyde Caldwell's draft

## cover of Tl (ultimately used as the cover for TSR's

## 5: Player Character Record Sheets)

## would serve as an ad­

## mirable cover for

## Sailors,

## or even an iteration of Stefan

## Poag's iconic frontispiece. Here Tl's giant frogs can be

## easily reimagined as anuran beastmen, and the thorns

## and sickly vines as the vine horrors in

## Sailors.

## Each illustration sounds the same clarion call: fallen

## grandeur jealously guarding mysteries of a bygone age;

## an overgrowth of sickly vines and thorny branches, that

## conceal death and decay; the certitude that whatever

## lurks inside the ruins is surely beyond mortal ken.

## Tem­

## ple

## delivers on these promises, and if

## Sailors-my

## first

## adventure written for the DCC RPG-succeeds in do­

## ing the same perhaps I can be forgiven for the homage.

## Fitting then, that

## DCC RPG # 100: The Music of the

## Spheres (is Chaos)

## should also owe a debt to

## The Temple

## of Elemental Evil.

## Astute readers are sure to note key

## parallels: cultists dedicated to the annihilation of Good;

## a terrible foe, progressively empowered by reckless PCs

## exploring the dungeon; and a maddeningly challeng­

## ing dungeon sure to thwart all but the most careful of

## cartographers; and most obviously, the elemental nodes

## and their masters.

## So how does one write an element-themed adventure in

## the footsteps of Temple, the fourth greatest adventure

## of all time?

## For DCC

## the path was clear. Eschewing

## Temple's

## hordes of vying factions,

## Spheres

## instead stakes its flag

## firmly on the fringes of occult spiritual science without

## troubling itself overmuch with alchemy's extensive history.

## (The

## true

## adventure delving into the alchymical wed­

## ding of science and art is yet to be written, hopefully by

## a better scholar than

## this

## passing apprentice.)

## And in lieu of multiple levels of sprawling dungeons,

## Spheres

## marches its spinning elemental wheels through

## Aereth's zodiac, transforming the challenges (and the

## PCs' powers) up and down the DCC RPG dice chain.

## So rather than a massive dungeon offering multiple lev­

## els of challenges,

## Spheres

## does its work on the PCs, im­

## proving and diminishing each class in turn.

## Can

## Spheres

## hope to deliver on the promises of its spirit­

## ual antecedent? That final analysis will only be decided

## by the judges and gamers daring enough to run DCC

## at their table. But whether

## Spheres

## succeeds or

## fails, it can stand proudly in the ambitious tradition of

## its ancestor and trailblazer:

## The Temple of Elemental Evil.

## Harley Stroh has been writing for Goodman Games since

## Legacy of the Savage Kings,

## yet he still gets

## nervous whenever he is about to run a game. He lives in

## the mountains of Colorado with his wife, two children,

## and a small but vicious dog.

## first wandered into the village of Hommlet back in

## I remember the dusty street, the first farm­

## houses, the people working in their gardens and

## fields. After a short walk, I passed the leatherworker's

## shop and came to the Inn of the Welcome Wench. The

## rich details were plain to see, in the main building,

## the barn, and then the people inside. I was soon en­

## sconced in the inn with a room (for me and my NPCs)

## and down in the common hall picking up rumors of a

## Moathouse and something evil that lurked beyond the

## confines of the little village.

## That was my introduction to Hommlet and to the ad­

## venture that would eventually become

## The Temple of

## Elemental Evil.

## Back in

## or

## my brother, Davis Chenault, ac­

## quired the little brown D&D books for his birthday.

## One of my father's soldiers had given them to my

## mother as something her children might enjoy (he was

## headed off on a hardship tour and couldn't keep them).

## "Don't let them play too much" was the warning as she

## took the books. I don't remember him saying that, but

## I do remember the moment he gave me those books. It

## was all very odd to me. Davis plunged into the game

## and started playing immediately, or trying to. He played

## hell getting his friends on board, so eventually, about a

## year later, he convinced me to sit down and make some

## characters. Once I started rolling those dice, I never

## stopped and still do, regularly on Thursday nights.

## In those days Davis had enough money in pocket (from

## babysitting I think) that allowed him to scoop up just

## about any TSR product that came out. I spent my mea­

## ger earnings on comic books (about Green Lantern and

## the Warlord most of all), almost never on the game. I

## didn't really have to, because he did, and did so with a

## gusto. He got the AD&D

## Monster

## Treasure Assort­

## ment

## at Sears, I remember that. He got the AD&D

## Players Handbook

## at some point and the AD&D

## Dun­

## geon Masters Guide

## for some Christmas. He was always

## coming home with something or the other. I didn't pay

## much attention to what he bought as most of it was

## DM's stuff, so he didn't want me looking at it anyway.

## (In an aside, we were living at Fort Campbell, Kentucky,

## in those days and bought our comics and games mostly at a

## small shop in some guy's basement, complete with old musty

## smelling walls and lamps hanging from the ceiling.)

## For that reason, I do not remember

## Tl: The Village of

## Hommlet

## coming into the house. But I do remember

## when my characters rambled down its dirty streets.

## I made fresh 1st-level characters (my own and a few

## NPCs) and entered the town ready for mayhem and

## dungeon crawling. We were fresh from the Giant series

## and had plunged into D

## too (I think, it's been a few

## turns in the road since then), and those were slaughter­

## houses, filled with giants and monsters at every turn. It

## was with those two adventures in mind that I entered

## the little village, ready for some monster to attack at any

## moment.

## But of course, nothing attacked my little band. I first

## met some farmers working in their gardens, then a

## leatherworker. Then came to the Inn of the Welcome

## Wench. Upon entering I encountered a host of people,

## with personalities and backstories. There were details

## here, details about common people that I hadn't quite

## encountered before. I didn't know it then, but that

## changed everything for me and the game we played.

## The game left the contested fields of wargames and sud­

## denly was real. It was a half-told story. I had to meet

## people, who had names and backgrounds and whose

## stories mattered to some overarching theme with an

## elemental evil that was haunting the lands. It was all

## quite . . .  nebulous. To be sure, we had already been run­

## ning games with NPCs, and that involved role-playing

## and the like. That was natural. But with Tl, a published

## adventure from TSR, it was confirmation that this game

## was so much more than any other game out there.

## The village map was so very real with trees, a lake, a mill

## on the stream, hills, and castles under construction. The

## inn was delivered to us in 3D; you could see the chairs

## and tables, the beds in the rooms. This was like nothing

## I had encountered before. In the Hill Giant Steading,

## I could see the giant. He was right there. He needed to

## die. Here in Hommlet, I met with a prosperous farmer

## and his family: Robert, Mandl, Taior, Matilda, and the

## granny Florence. This was altogether different.

## (Those are the names, written in the margi.ns of the first Tl

## Davis bought and ran me through. We still have it, sitting

## here on my desk as I write this. )

## The Village of Hommlet

## has a certain elegance to it. Gary

## Gygax: wrote this short module with a clear adventure

## story in mind, created a host of NPCs, people, that

## lived within the confines of the story and were active or

## inactive participants in it. The story is simple, but the

## setting is vibrant and seems to exist wholly apart from

## the characters. Something is going on here that involves

## all the people of this village and your characters are

## only one small part of it. In a few short paragraphs, we

## are introduced to the political regions of central Grey­

## hawk, made to understand it is a feudal realm, placed in

## the rolling-though not peaceful-farmlands of these

## simple people. It is all very real. Descriptions of goblin

## raids for food are so simple, yet so electrifying.

## Tl is so much more than that. It unleashed the DM

## like few adventures before or really after it. Here were

## all these people, some with backgrounds, others not so

## much. They didn't have names (a few did) and were

## only loosely placed in the larger story. The DM could,

## if they chose, flesh it all out. It followed a style estab­

## lished in

## Bl: In Search of the Unknown

## (my second fa­

## vorite adventure) where the DM could take the pub­

## lished adventure and flesh it out. In that dungeon, the

## rooms were described and written up, but no monsters

## or treasures were added. That was up to the DM to do,

## to go in and make the dungeon their own. Hommlet

## was very much like that. Gary Gygax: managed, in one

## simple swoop, to create a setting so vibrant it drew the

## DM, and by consequence the players, into the village

## and its story, but at the same time showed the DM a

## path of creation. The DM could do anything with it.

## In many ways, Tl was a teaching moment for gam­

## ers. I'm not sure if that's how Gary meant it when he

## wrote it, but it's how it played out. It showed DMs and

## players that you could, if you chose, add all manner of

## depth to your games. The sky is the limit. It opened up

## worlds of adventure, like nothing before or after. That's

## at least how it felt for me.

## It has something else, too. The art that came with Tl

## was nothing short of amazing. The opening shot of the

## village, the keep, and the Moathouse to name a few.

## All of these grounded the game. Suddenly we were in

## a world where everything was real. It wasn't just a fan­

## tastic place like a Michael Moorcock novel. It was real.

## And we were in it.

## We need to take a moment and give credit to the artist

## of the Moathouse. That simple drawing fueled count­

## less imaginations, making the adventure ever more real,

## grounding it further in a world of sweat and tears.

## We plunged into Tl and played the living hell out of it.

## More than once we wandered those dusty streets. And

## a few years later, when we moved to Heidelberg, Ger­

## many, Davis formed his own group and I put together

## another. Tl was the first adventure I ran them through.

## Since those early days, I have played Tl countless times,

## with countless adventuring parties. I change people up,

## give them different names, different motivations, even

## the backstory changes. The written module itself is

## timeless.

## There was no completed, published Temple in the early

## days of course (the complete series came out in 1 985),

## but there was more than enough to go on and Davis,

## and later myself, fleshed it out wherever we needed.

## The

## Temple of Elemental Evil

## was a part of our Greyhawk

## long before the actual published mega-adventure hit

## the stands. Everything you needed was right there, in

## those opening paragraphs. The world was yours and the

## Temple an enemy both real and imagined.

## I don't remember pining for the rest of the adventure.

## I just assumed this was it and the creators in their lofty

## towers of Lake Geneva never intended to finish it. But

## when they did release it, in 1985, and I managed to

## score a copy of it, it amazed me, for despite all the time

## that had passed it stood up to the original. Here was

## the whole grand struggle, unfolding before me and my

## players. (I never returned to the full Temple with Da­

## vis.) The adventure unfolded in multiple levels and was

## pure Gygax.

## In later years, when I came to work with Gary (Troll

## Lord Games was Gary's primary publisher from 2001-

## 2008) I learned more about him, his gaming, and his

## writing style. There was a deep sense of historical con­

## text infused in the way he saw fantasy worlds and their

## creation. He, and with him, Frank Mentzer, brought

## this to

## The Temple of Elemental Evil,

## making it one of

## the most amazing adventure publications created for

## role-playing games. It has an almost perfect balance to

## it. There is enough here to flesh out any campaign, but

## not so much that it bogs the DM down with too much

## information. You can take the Temple and run with it,

## fuse it to your world, or play in Greyhawk.

## As I noted before, there is an elegance to its conception,

## design, and writing. It's an elegance that makes the first

## Tl: The Village of Hommlet

## and later

## Tl-4: The Temple

## of Elemental Evil

## one of the greatest, if not the greatest,

## published adventure modules in the history of our il­

## lustrious hobby.

## Steve Chenault

## Written in the Plague Year, 2020

## Born in Monticello, Arkansas in 1967, Stephen Chenault

## spent the early years as an Army brat. Stephen started play­

## ing Dungeons

## Dragons in and around 1977 After re­

## ceiving his undergraduate degree in History, he joined the

## Army serving during (but not at) Desert Storm. After leav­

## ing the service he received his master's degree in History.

## Stephen settled in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1996. Soon

## after, in 1999, he founded Troll Lord Games with Mac

## Golden and Davis Chenault. Stephen took over sole man­

## agement of the company in 2003. TLG has published hun­

## dreds of RPG books, working with such industry founders

## as Gary Gygax and James

## Ward. He has created and

## written a score of adventures,

## Codex of Aihrde,

## and

## Ad­

## venturers Backpack,

## and has written fiction; he continues

## to be a major designer and writer for Castles

## Crusades.

## he year was 1985, and

## Tl-4: The Temple of El­

## emental Evil

## was in full swing/or its Fall release. At

## that time, TSR staff artist Jef Easley had been with

## the company for a little over three years. Widely known

## for his covers of the orange-spined first edition Advanced

## Dungeons

## Dragons books, countless module covers, un­

## forgettable Dragonlance imagery, and so much more, Jef

## was assigned to work on

## The Temple of Elemental Evil.

## Jef would go on to work for TSR from 1982-1997 and

## continue working for Wizards of the Coast {WotC) until

## 2003. In this interview, conducted on August 17th, 2020

## at his friend Chris Arnesons home, Jef sat down to tell us

## about his time at TSR, what inspired him, and why hes

## so amazing.

## Please raise your right hand and state

## your full name, date of birth, social security number,

## favorite candy, and how much my monthly payments

## have been in order to be your friend. Or, just state your

## name, I guess.

## [Laughs]

## Make that note: Jeff Easley raised one finger.

## [Laughs] Okay, it's my understanding that you started

## at TSR in March of 1 982. How did they manage to

## pull you away from your previous job at the popcorn

## factory? Feel free to share a story or two from your time

## there.

## The popcorn factory? Well, one story that pops to

## mind is the time that I'd

## .

## just started running the pop­

## corn lines in the morning, which sprayed the cheese on

## the popcorn through a large rotating cylinder. Nobody

## told me that they would fill the lines up with soapy wa­

## ter the night before to keep the pipes cleaned out, and

## that I had to drain that soapy water out in the morning

## when I got there. So for a couple days, I was spraying

## bags of popcorn with soapy water rather than cheese

## muck. That's the way it goes. You get what you pay for.

## How did you go from the popcorn factory to TSR?

## How did they get you over there?

## Well, I was pretty much unfamiliar with TSR. I had

## probably heard of Dungeons & Dragons. I had met

## Larry Elmore a few years earlier through a good friend

## of ours, Greg Harper. Greg mentioned to me that Larry

## had taken a job with TSR. I was pretty desperate to find

## anything other than the popcorn factory. I knew Larry

## just well enough to call and ask him about the prospects

## at TSR. He told me that they were growing by leaps and

## bounds at that point in 1 982, and I had a really good

## shot ifl got a portfolio together and sent it in. So I did,

## and that's what set me on their trail.

## Was there any negotiating? Or did they call you

## back, you went in, they liked your portfolio, gave you

## an offer, and they hired you?

## Well, they flew me out there. It was not a fun trip.

## This was in the middle of winter, from Massachusetts to

## Wisconsin, but they flew me out to look at my stuff and

## talk to me. They probably made up their mind before­

## hand that they were going to offer me the job. I doubt

## they would have bothered to have flown me in if they

## were on the fence.

## They did that, I talked to them, and they made an of­

## fer. I would have accepted just about anything at that

## point. So, yeah, that was what got the ball rolling.

## You picked up your family and moved, you and

## your wife? Did you have kids at the time?

## Just one at the time, but, yeah, we didn't have a

## huge amount of stuff at that point. We arranged for a

## mover to come and pick up our stuff. We flew from

## Massachusetts out to Wisconsin.

## Did you find a house right away, or did you start in

## an apartment somewhere?

## We got a condo over on Main Street in Lake Gene­

## va. Several other TSR people lived in the same condo.

## Nice. Since I've been doing some research about

## you, I was thrilled to find some older work of yours I'd

## never seen. Had you done much professional fanzine

## work prior to TSR?

## Well, most fanzine work is not actually professional.

## Most of them don't pay anything, but a few of them

## did. I had really been into fantasy and that sort of stuff

## when I was younger, but I got out of it through high

## school and college, because it wasn't really serious art.

## About halfway through college, I kind of jumped back

## into fantasy. I had become disenchanted with the whole

## college art thing, the studio kind of stuff, and I just real­

## ized how much I enjoyed doing the fantasy stuff. So I

## just jumped back into it.

## At the time, fanzines were pretty big. I think a lot of

## them advertised in various magazines like

## The Monster

## Times

## and so forth. I would sometimes send some sam­

## ples in, and occasionally, they would use some stuff.

## You said that was just kind oflike pro bono fanzine

## work. You were just trying to get your work in there?

## Some of it was. Some of the nicer ones paid, you

## know, a little bit like $30 or $40 a page or whatever.

## While I was looking stuff up, I found a couple that

## were covers for

## Chacal.

## Yeah, it was a nicely done magazine. They actually

## paid a little bit. I forget what it was for doing a cover.

## Those are pretty nice. You did some other fanzines

## like

## Fantasy Crosswinds

## and

## The Diversifier.

## Now, when

## I was digging into your stuff, I saw that you had done

## some work for Marvel's

## Savage Sword of Conan

## and

## Bi­

## zarre Adventures?

## Well, at one point when I was still in college, I

## managed to make a trip out to New York. I had been

## corresponding with a fellow in Lexington, Kentucky-

## Roger McKenzie-who became a well-known comic

## artist. He invited me to come out there. He was in the

## process of moving to New York, so he invited me to

## come out for a week, show me around, help me con­

## nect, and maybe get my foot in the door.

## I did that. It was the first time

## ever flown anywhere

## or anything else, so it was quite an ordeal. I went out

## there, and he had been working for most of the big

## companies. I managed to do a couple little pieces for

## Marvel, a story for one of the Warren Publishing maga­

## zines, and a few things like that just to get my foot in

## the door. So it was worth the time and effort.

## Would the Warren magazines include your

## Creepy

## covers? You did two

## Creepy

## covers?

## at

## Well, yeah, they basically bought it out of my port-

## folio. It wasn't necessarily a commission, but I had al­

## ready done those, and they bought them to use.

## I've seen the originals. They're pretty awesome.

## Thanks.

## What I didn't know

## you had some stuff

## Vampirella?

## As far as I can remember, it was just inking a couple

## stories.

## Nice. Jumping back to TSR, there's a lot of talk

## about Gary Gygax having an Appendix N of inspira­

## tional reading in the

## Dungeon Masters Guide.

## Some of

## the authors listed were Robert E. Howard, Tolkien, and

## Edgar Rice Burroughs. Did any of these authors inspire

## or influence you much?

## I don't think they influenced me, but I basically read

## some of them, mainly because I bought the books with

## the Frazetta covers on them and I thought I may as well

## try them out. I read a few of Edgar Rice Burroughs's

## Mars books and a few of the Conan books, which were

## mostly short stories. I read what I could get hold of.

## Had you read much Tolkien at that time?

## I remember I read

## The Hobbit

## when I was like in

## the fifth grade. I read

## The Lord of the Rings

## when I was

## in college.

## Did those inspire you at all? I don't know if you

## bought those for their covers, because if I remember,

## the covers on the Tolkien books way back when weren't

## necessarily anything special.

## Yeah, I just bought and read them because of the

## word of mouth and, you know, the buzz.

## As an artist myself, I'm inspired by the work of

## other artists. While your work has been a big inspira­

## tion to me, what artists were big inspirations for you?

## Do I dare guess Frazetta? [Laughs]

## Yeah, he's certainly the main one. I think you're

## influenced a little bit by everything that you see that

## you consider to be better than what you could do. I'm

## always looking to study other people's approaches, how

## they do leaves or rocks, down to the details like that.

## Frazetta ... I don't know to what extent I had that much

## exposure to some of the more mainstream or illustrator­

## type artists. I probably sought them out more after I

## was in college or afterwards even at a time when I could

## have been more influenced by them during my more

## developmental phase.

## Yeah, back in the Stone Age, there weren't too

## many places to find this stuff.

## There was certainly no Internet.

## Advertisements in the back of comic books?

## There weren't that many books, really. I think the

## fantasy art book craze actually started with the Frazetta

## books back in the mid-1970s. And then all of a sud­

## den, everybody was having books, magazines, and more

## well-produced material come out.

## I assume you're familiar with Hal Foster and Alex

## Raymond, some of the comic strip masters. Were you

## familiar with them as a kid or in college?

## I remember probably one of the first examples of

## Frazetta's work that I saw were the early Warren maga­

## zines, like

## Creepy

## and

## Eerie.

## At that point, Al William­

## son was actually doing work for them. He's one of the

## EC Comics alumni that had come up and was working

## for Warren at the time. So I was aware of his work.

## Honestly, I felt like it was just so far beyond my ability

## I didn't even consider that I could emulate it or aspire

## to it, you know?

## What about Hal Foster? Did he do

## Prince Valiant?

## Yeah, well, he did

## Tarzan

## early on and

## Prince Val­

## iant.

## He had kind of a big revival in the 1970s, too.

## There was kind of, like I say, a renaissance of fantasy

## art and old comic art and so forth. I had never been

## exposed to it, maybe it was around before then, but

## I started buying this

## Comics Buyer's Guide.

## Everybody

## advertised in that kind of book, and reprints of all that

## stuff were coming out then. So it was almost a little bit

## too late for me to be totally influenced by it. I could

## certainly admire it and aspire to it to some degree.

## You started at TSR in March of 1982. Do you re­

## member what your first assignment was? Somewhere

## along the lines of the jewels on the spines of the

## Endless

## Quest

## books, maybe?

## Yeah, that was it. I literally went there, and I was

## standing there my first day with my coat still on, and

## they handed me this thing. "We need these jewels done

## for the spines. Larry has been doing these covers for this

## Endless Quest

## book series." I thought, "Well, all right.

## Whatever you need." So it was the first thing I did after

## I took my coat off. I sat down and painted some jewels

## for a few of the

## Endless Quest

## book covers.

## If you recall, did they have paints and everything

## set up for you? Or did you have to bring in your own?

## I think I might have brought my own paint with

## me, because I had it there anyway. Eventually, they

## probably had me put in an order and replaced it, but I

## still have some of the paint. There was a lady at Murray

## [State University in Kentucky- Editor] who had taken

## an oil painting class and didn't like it, I guess, so she

## gave me all her paint. [Laughs] I probably still have half

## that paint up there in my studio.

## Along the lines of your beginning work, I've heard

## you talk about the AD&D module

## The Lost Caverns of

## Tsojcanth

## as your first big assignment. Were you excited

## to work on it?

## Well, I didn't know anything about it. It was just

## like, "This is what you're gonna do." I can't remember if

## I did the

## Tsojcanth

## illustrations before I did the painting

## for the Star Frontiers module cover. I thought I did the

## painting first, but I could be wrong.

## It sounds like you hadn't played a game at the

## time. Did you understand what the game modules were

## essentially like or anything? Did they just give you,

## "Here's a description of a scene," and then you did the

## illustration for it? I'm speaking of

## Tsojcanth.

## Yeah, I had no idea what this game stuff was, so they

## just told me what they wanted in the illustration. Most

## of them were little quarter-page spots anyway. And I

## wasn't familiar with a lot of the monsters and so forth,

## so I had to sit there and rely on the

## Monster Manual

## or

## whatever reference I could find to see if they had been

## drawn before. They told me what they wanted, and I

## put it down there.

## One of your illustrations that really stands out to

## everybody is your amazing image of Drelnza, the sleep­

## ing warrior vampire. Did the art description inspire you

## more on that one or did you just have more time? That

## one really stands out. It's a nice big full-page piece.

## Well, that's the thing. It was the only full-page piece

## in there, so I thought, "Well, I can put a little bit more

## into this one." Nobody was on my back for deadlines or

## anything, so I just thought, "I'll do this one up."

## Nice. Well done, amazing piece.

## Thanks.

## You covered it a bit already, but how long was it

## before you got to do your first cover painting, and what

## was it?

## For the Star Frontiers game, it was the one with the

## squid guy on the dinosaur thing. I forget the names of

## them.

## Volturnus, Planet of Mystery.]

## I do know what you're talking about. I might have

## seen the original.

## It was around for a good while.

## It's a neat piece.

## Were you excited to do that first cover piece for them?

## Yeah. When I took the job at TSR, I didn't know

## if I was going to be doing any covers or not. I thought

## maybe I was just going to be doing black and whites. I

## mean, I was working at a popcorn factory. I would have

## moved over there to empty the trash cans if they'd asked

## me. [Laughs] So I was a little surprised when I found

## out that everybody else is actually doing covers also. So

## fine.

## Was there something about the woman's figure, or

## her suit, that you had to change?

## Yes, I originally had painted her with a red jumpsuit

## which was vaguely form-fitting. It was kind of a typical

## 1950s- or 1960s-style space girl suit-but it was red.

## They brought in one of the ladies who cleaned the office

## and had her critique it for me. [Laughs] They asked her

## if she would let her son buy this module, and I think

## she was swayed more than anything by the fact that

## they asked her if she thought it was fishy or not, and she

## said, "Oh, no, I wouldn't let my son buy this."

## I was not trying to be provocative at all. Typically, in

## fantasy art, both male and female figures are idealized.

## You don't paint, you know, your dumpy neighbors or use

## them

## the models in your fantasy art. So anyway, the

## compromise that was reached was that

## glaze the suit

## over with blue to turn it purple. I guess purple was less

## inflammatory to young adolescent eyes than they figured

## red was. That was enough to get it by. I didn't change the

## figure at all. I just altered the color of the suit.

## Really, just the color of the suit. That's interesting.

## Stupid is what it is.

## [Laughs] That, too. I don't remember if I heard

## that part of the story, but that's cool. They actually

## asked-nothing against cleaning ladies-but they just

## pulled someone aside. I guess it makes sense, "Would

## you let your kid buy this?"

## Since we're talking about the covers, how long did TSR

## generally give you to do a cover? Did you have plenty of

## time in most cases?

## When I did the first Dragonlance calendar, they

## gave us all the time we needed, because they were going

## to reuse the art for the modules. I guess the schedule

## was such that it was not pressing. I might have taken a

## month on a painting like that. But the worst thing I can

## remember was when I did those little

## Amazing Stories

## paperbacks. For some reason, I think I had to do four

## of those in a week or something like that.

## Holy cow!

## I don't think it was even a week. I was going to

## say three days, but that doesn't sound right. Maybe it

## was three covers in four days, because they wanted this

## airbrushed background. I was not familiar with an air­

## brush, so it took me an entire day to figure out how to

## do the airbrushed backgrounds. Then, I think I did the

## covers, like, one a day.

## You've become very well known for your amazing

## dragons. I've noticed a major shift between your early

## dragons, like for the cover of the orange-spined AD&D

## Monster Manual,

## as compared to your much more mus­

## cular and menacing dragons for Dragonlance. Had you

## drawn any dragons before TSR, and what was your first

## dragon you drew for them, if you recall?

## Well, the only drawing of a dragon I ever recall hav­

## ing done before TSR was for the aforementioned

## Cha­

## cal

## magazine. I did a portfolio with five or six pen and

## inks from

## The Hobbit,

## and one of those was Smaug at­

## tacking the city. So that was the first time I ever did a

## dragon.

## For TSR, I suspect the first time I drew a dragon was

## for the

## Tsojcanth

## interiors. There are a couple dragons in

## there, so those are my first attempts.

## The other black and white one I remember was, I

## guess, for an early Gen Con advertisement with a num­

## ber of PCs battling a dragon in pen and ink, one of your

## earlier ones. It was also, ifl recall, printed on the inside

## of the French version of the B/X basic set.

## The Dragon and the

## George.

## Dragon and

## the George

## Monster

## Manual

## Magister

## 1he Temple of

## Elemental Evil

## Temple

## Kragmar from the Land Beyond the Mountains, an el­

## ven magic-user. I was lucky enough to roll up a pseu­

## dodragon familiar, which was highly coveted by some

## of the rest of the group. [Laughs]

## After about a year or so-I had been playing for a

## while-I think I finally reached 6th level, and I ac­

## quired my

## fireball

## spell. So I was itching to use that

## sucker, you know. At one point, we were in a situation

## where it seemed like a good idea. I think Jim had left as

## DM, and Keith Parkinson had taken over DMing.

## So Keith said, "Are you sure? Did you read the instruc­

## tions and the parameters and so forth?" I said, "Yeah,

## I'm going to throw the

## fireball."

## And he kept ... [Laughs]

## He almost begged me not to throw that

## fireball,

## but I

## threw it anyway. Yeah, it pretty much fried everybody,

## and since I was an elf, I couldn't be resurrected or some­

## thing like that. So I really fried myself I think I also

## fried my pseudodragon and everything else. Yeah, that

## was a miscalculation. We limped along for a little while

## after that, but it wasn't quite the same.

## CA: Do you remember who was playing in that campaign?

## Larry and Keith. I can't remember if Tim Truman

## was there at the time. I think Clyde was actually play­

## ing, too. Keith was DMing. I can't remember . . .  Maybe

## Steve Sullivan. There have been so many people who

## have come and gone during my tenure there that it's

## hard for me to remember where they overlap.

## Having known you for years, I know you have

## a great wit and sense of humor. I also know that art­

## ists sometimes like to sneak little Easter eggs into their

## work. I recently had one brought to my attention that

## is on page

## of the

## Unearthed Arcana

## book where you

## illustrated an open grimoire. Amongst the gibberish

## type, you snuck in some phrases such as "Help me,"

## "Send me money," etc. Just what were you thinking,

## and can you think of any other times you snuck in an

## Easter egg or a hidden meaning or reference?

## Well, I just thought it'd be fun to do that to break up

## the gibberish type, as you put it. I remember one time,

## actually, in one of my Warren stories. My aforementioned

## friend, Greg Harper, was a big comic book fan. At the time

## I was inking this comic book work, there was a jungle scene

## or something like that, so like down in the underbrush, I

## put, "Hi, Greg,'' and alerted him after it was published to

## look for it. [Laughs] He got a kick out of that, I think.

## I would do that every now and then if something crossed

## my mind. One main thing I remember is the time I :was

## supposed to do some kind of a black pudding, or some­

## thing like that. I forget what it was. It was just kind of

## an amorphous blob shape. So I did a silhouette of Bull­

## winkle the Moose upside down and used that for the

## character drawing. I didn't think anybody would spot it

## until three or four of the designers trooped down and

## confronted me with it. They got a kick out of it, I think.

## Did it make it to print?

## Yeah, I think it did.

## Nice.

## Unless your name is Hanna or Barbera, then it did

## not get to print, of course.

## Since this is a Goodman Games book, I must point

## out that you've done some great, fun work for them,

## too. I have a couple of favorite pieces in mind. Do you

## have a favorite or two that you did for Goodman?

## I'm not sure if I can remember everything I did.

## Probably, one of my favorites that I can remember is the

## trap illustration [in

## The Dungeon Alphabet].

## It's a skel­

## eton reaching out and picking up a gold coin with a lit­

## tle chain.

## he was pulling, he set off the trap, and he's

## impaled on a couple of dozen spikes. Obviously, this

## happened some time ago, because he's a skeleton now. I

## think that was one of the first things I did for them, and

## it hit me immediately what to do. I didn't have to sit

## there and think about it. Ir's what immediately popped

## into my head for "trap."

## CA: That's nice when an idea just pops into your head.

## That's a great perspective on that illustration, too. It's kind

## of from the perspective of the coin on the floor, almost.

## Yeah. Luckily, sometimes something like that pops

## in your head and by the time you draw it, you've totally

## changed it or missed the impact that you had in your

## head. But with that one, the perspective, angle, and eve­

## rything was right on. I was pleased with that one.

## Yeah, it's one of my favorites. Most people know

## you as a pretty good fantasy artist, but they may not

## know what an incredible sculptor you are. I've seen

## many amazing sculpts by you over the years. I under­

## stand that you sculpted the Andy Gump statue in Flat

## Iron Park in Lake Geneva. You also sculpted a life-size

## Verminaard helmet for the Dragonlance board game

## and an alien skull for the back of the Dark Sun box.

## Did you do much other sculpting for TSR or anywhere

## else over the years, and do you have any information on

## the ones I listed?

## When I was growing up, I enjoyed modeling with

## typical Plasticine modeling clay. I did probably just as

## much sculpting as I did drawing. Building stuff was a

## part of it-something I always enjoyed doing. I just

## have never really had any reason to do it, which is why I

## don't do it very often. Of course, there's no foreshorten­

## ing or anything like that, but sculpting has its own set

## of problems and solutions, different than drawing.

## Your Andy Gump sculpture is still standing in

## Lake Geneva?

## Yeah, luckily, he was not a Confederate soldier or

## anything. So, yeah, he's still up there for now. One rea­

## son I had to do it was that it was originally sculpted,

## I think, back in the 1920s and presented to [Sidney

## Smith,] the fellow who drew Andy Gump. But, yeah,

## it was just a plaster statue he donated to Lake Geneva.

## They put it up, and it basically dissolved in the weather.

## So they had it redone numerous times over the years.

## Of course, you get up into the 1960s and so forth, and

## people were starting to vandalize it.

## When I got involved, someone had actually stolen the

## whole statue, so there was nothing there. A fellow had

## started a base, but he passed away before he got to finish

## it. Somehow, they got my name. I'm not sure how I was

## associated with it, but I figured I could do it, you know.

## I just had to get like 350 pounds of oil-based modeling

## clay, which took forever to unwrap

## one pound at a time.

## I did about 90% of it. I was kind of dragging my feet,

## because I did it for nothing. I didn't feel too pressed to

## get it done. [Laughs] The city brought in another fel­

## low, Jerry Sawyer, who's a sculptor. He put his hand in.

## He tightened up some of the sculpting, but I did about

## 90% of it. And he was, like, the model maker. He did

## the mold for it. They sent it up to a place in Wiscon­

## sin which did miniature golf-type statues and stuff, and

## they cast it in fiberglass. That's how that got done.

## To go back to your Verminaard helmet and Dark

## Sun box alien, how did it come about that you got to

## do those?

## That was just in-house. I forget who I did it for. Roy

## Parker might have been involved in one or two, maybe

## both of them, but whoever contacted me or asked me

## knew that I was able to do it. So I said, "Yeah, I'll do it."

## The helmet was just made out of plaster, and the skull

## was plaster and Sculpey. It was fun to do, but I basically

## did it in-house.

## You used to do a lot of sculpting in sets for the local

## YMCA, ifl'm not mistaken.

## The YMCA, I used to help them out. They'd have

## a dinner every year. It was always a themed fundraiser.

## One year, they did "The Wizard of Oz." So I sculpted

## or built a witch's hourglass for them to use up on the

## podium. We did the backgrounds; we did a big wizard

## head, machinery, some Styrofoam Emerald City towers,

## and all this kind of stuff. It was always a lot of fun to do.

## At one point, the Fire Department was doing a haunted

## house every year, so I got involved in that. For four or

## five years, I did something for them. I did a full-size

## Tyrannosaurus head one year, and then a crashed space­

## ship, and several things like that. It was always fun to do.

## I saw a set you were working on once. You were

## building a full-blown set. I can't remember what it was

## called, but you had tombstones and ...

## Oh, it was like a graveyard, maybe. I think they did

## a mausoleum. Was that the same thing? I did do a lot

## of tombstones for them one year. I built an ''Alien" suit

## and, like, an ''Alien" corridor with machinery and stuff

## in it.

## You like building with your hands and sculpting,

## and you're incredibly talented in that aspect, not just

## painting. I just thought it'd be neat to share.

## Well, I enjoy doing it. It's certainly a change of pace

## from all the painting.

## CA: You worked on staff at TSR from 1 982 until it was

## bought by Wizards of the Coast back in 1997?

## Well, yeah, but I continued on with WotC until

## about 2003. I think I made it just over the 20-year

## mark when they pretty much let everybody go.

## Well, tell us a little or a lot about your time there,

## some favorite memories with other artists, or the game.

## The whole 20 years in general or just with WotC?

## Your whole time there, if you've got any fun sto­

## ries or your favorite memories with other guys working

## there. I've heard stories where it sounds like you guys

## had a lot of fun.

## One story that comes to mind and has been told

## before happened early on at Gen Con when I think it

## was still held over at Parkside, the college, in Wiscon­

## sin. TSR was going through kind of a tight spell with

## money, and they didn't want to pay for our hotel rooms

## to stay at Gen Con. So I think it was me, Clyde, Larry,

## and Keith. I believe Larry had borrowed a big tent from

## a neighbor, and we set it up in the Jellystone Camp­

## ground near Parkside there. We camped out in a tent on

## the nights we were at Gen Con that year.

## One night, I think Larry ran us all out with his snor­

## ing. Clyde and I went home, and when we got back

## the next morning, Keith was sleeping in the truck. He

## couldn't stand to sleep in the tent when Larry was snor­

## ing. [Laughs] That's an old one.

## Any other interesting stories from your time at

## TSR? Any fun in the art room?

## Well, another story that we've told numerous times

## is about the dart games we used to get up to there. Larry

## had done this at Fort Knox, again. I think Larry is the

## only one who had ever worked for any length of time in

## an art department, so he had a lot of traditions that he

## carried through.

## We got a dartboard and started throwing darts at lunch­

## time. None of us were very good, but some had gotten

## better quicker, you know. We all went over to the local

## store that actually sold darts, and we each got our own

## darts, custom flights, that kind of stuff. It was fun to

## do that.

## We would knock off a little early on weekdays, about

## 4:30, and we'd start a few games of darts before we left.

## One day, we were sitting there throwing darts. Behind

## us, there was a little window that went into the produc­

## tion room. One of us turned around and noticed that

## Lorraine Williams, the head of the company, was stand­

## ing there watching us throw darts. [Laughs] So we just

## kind of froze there, and then baby-stepped our way back

## to our chairs. Nothing was ever said about it, but we

## were all a little caught with our hands in the cookie jar.

## Your deadlines didn't get shorter after that? [Laughs]

## They were probably short enough.

## CA: I seem to recall a story about a rubber band fight

## that was had while you were out of the room. I'm sure

## there were ones you participated in.

## That must have been the one where they skipped a

## rubber band across my wet painting, and somebody sat

## there and doodled with it to fix it. I didn't know it hap­

## pened until somebody told me about it later. I heard

## about it later, but I don't think I ever noticed it.

## Fun stuff.

## At one point, we made blowguns. You take an alu­

## minum arrow shaft, cut off the ends, and then use that

## as the tube. We would get those upholstery needles with

## those little balls on the end. I don't even know what

## the needles are for, but you can stick them in the arrow

## shaft to make great blowgun darts.

## So we were shooting blowgun darts at the dartboard.

## At one point, I found out that one of the other artists

## I won't name skipped a blowgun dart off the floor and

## stuck it in one of my paintings. I think even to this day

## there's a little blowgun dart hole in one of my paintings.

## While you were at TSR, did you get to meet or

## work with any other high-profile celebrity artists that

## you were a fan of or whose work you admired?

## For a pretty good stretch there, we had guest artists

## at Gen Con. We had a number of people who we ad­

## mired, thought we could get, and so forth like the afore­

## mentioned Tim Hildebrandt. Who all did we have? At

## one point, it had kind of left our hands; the Gen Con

## people themselves were inviting the artists. We had Mi­

## chael Whelan. That was a big one, and a comic artist,

## Mike Grell. Steve Hickman, he was a really nice guy. I

## think we actually got Boris there one year.

## CA: Do you remember how that came about?

## Well, since you want to hear the story . . .  [Laughs]

## I think they'd been in contact with Boris, and they had

## [Gerald] Brom. So Brom got tagged to be, like, the li­

## aison between Boris and Gen Con or, at the very least,

## he was the one who was supposed to contact Boris and

## talk to him and see if he could convince him to come

## to Gen Con.

## Anyway, Boris was supposed to call Brom, I guess. Let's

## see if I can get this right. Brom was kind of on pins and

## needles at the prospect of talking to Boris to negotiate

## with him. I went down and talked to Diesel [Laforce],

## and said, "Why don't you call upstairs and impersonate

## Boris?" [Laughs]

## So it was your idea!

## Yeah, yeah. So he went, "Oh, okay." A half an hour

## later, the phone rings. "Brom, Boris is on the phone!"

## Brom's eyes got big, and he sat down. Then, he talked to

## him for, you know,

## minutes, negotiating hotels and

## everything else. He got off the phone. "Everything's all

## set up."

## I expected Diesel to let him in on the prank while they

## were on the phone rather than afterwards. Well, Die­

## sel comes upstairs and says to Brom, "Was that Boris

## on the phone?" Brom answered, "Yeah." "What was he

## asking?" "This, this, and this." "Did he ask you this?"

## "Yeah."

## Somehow or another Diesel managed to relay the infor­

## mation that it was him impersonating Boris. I thought

## it might have been funnier if he'd just said something

## like, "Where do you want to go for lunch? I'll be right

## up," or something like that. But it was funny. [Laughs]

## CA: Nice. I know Diesel can expound on that since he

## made the phone call. He has been talking about every­

## thing he told Brom, all the requirements that "Boris"

## wanted in order to get him to go to Gen Con. That's

## pretty funny.

## Do you have any favorite memories of living in Lake

## Geneva? I know a lot of the fans of TSR and Gen Con

## just love Lake Geneva and the area.

## JE: Well, it was a really nice place to live, but, of course,

## during the summer, it's so crowded, and I'd avoid it. I'd

## avoid downtown like the plague. But, yeah, it's a beauti­

## ful lake and so forth. At this point, the main attraction

## as far as I'm concerned is actually Gary Con, which is a

## convention they have every year. Gary Gygax's children

## started it up after his death. It's grown in popularity and

## scope every year. Unfortunately, this year was canceled,

## but hopefully, they'll be back next year. It's something I

## always look forward to.

## Did the TSR gang have any favorite meet-ups,

## hangouts, or favorite restaurants in town that you fre­

## quented?

## JE: Su Wings here in town is a Chinese restaurant. It's

## been here longer than I have, so that was always a popu­

## lar TSR lunchtime destination. Also, we went to the

## Next Door Pub fairly often; it's right where the old TSR

## building was, right across the highway. And, if you go

## out the back door of the old building and go across the

## lot, there used to be a Pick 'n Save. That's what we usu­

## ally had for lunch. We'd walk over there, get some stuff

## from the deli, and bring it back to sit and eat there in

## the break room.

## Exciting. [Laughs] How long was Next Door Pub

## there? Has that been around since you guys were there?

## JE: Yeah, that's been there as long as I can remember.

## I can only imagine how fun Halloween parties with

## a bunch of talented artists like yourselves would have

## been. Would you care to share any Halloween party sto­

## ries, or talk about costumes you made over the years?

## JE: [Laughs] I was a lot more energetic back in the day

## than I am now. Occasionally, I would get inspired to do

## something. At one point, when I first got there, they'd

## have a Halloween parade. People came in costume,

## almost like in grade school. They'd line up and walk

## around the building and stuff, you know, so people

## could see your costumes.

## The first year I was there, I'd only been there a few

## months, but others had said people occasionally do stuff

## for Halloween. I was living in an apartment with basi­

## cally no supplies, but I had some cardboard and scissors

## and stuff. So I cut out and pieced together a hatchet

## painted with some acrylic paintings that I happened to

## have on site. And I made a little piece on there that I

## think I actually glued to my head. I brought that into

## work the next day and put it on in the bathroom, you

## know. I didn't have any proper makeup stuff so I actually

## glued it to my head with Elmer's glue. I also didn't have

## any kind of blood stuff, but in the cupboard I found

## a package of strawberry Jell-0. I mixed the strawberry

## Jell-0 up into a slurry and kind of piled that around

## where it was going in. It was dripping down my face.

## So, yeah, it was something of a hit. We artists were still

## over in the old hotel, and Jim Roslof decided that I

## needed to go over to the office, with this thing on my

## head, and have a drawing approved in person. He just

## wanted me to go over to the main building. Somebody

## drove me over there to get an approval on my drawing

## with an axe in my head.

## Another year, I built a big Transformers suit out of card­

## board boxes. I don't even have photos of these things. I

## think I had one photo of it, and I did something with

## it. I think I actually have a photo somewhere with the

## axe in my head, too. I did the "Alien" chest-burster one

## year, too.

## Wasn't there a picture of you guys where you're

## wearing the Transformers costume or a knight's helmet?

## JE: One year, I just made this big goofy set of armor

## out of cardboard and construction paper. We had man­

## nequins and stuff in the art department, and I just had

## this big, old, oversized helmet sitting up in my cabinet

## there.

## At one point, they wanted us to dress up for a picture

## on the back of the calendar. Some of the guys had ar­

## mor and swords and stuff. Well, I just put on my big

## goofy-looking cardboard helmet, just for the back of

## this cover. It looked pretty ridiculous. I had a big axe

## and stuff. It was fun.

## Do you have any fun stories about Halloween par­

## ties with these guys?

## JE: Well, Diesel got to the point where he would throw

## a Halloween party every year. I think he and Dawn

## Murin kind of collaborated on it toward the end. It was

## always a lot of fun.

## CA: Did any of the artists ever dress up like other artists

## at Halloween parties?

## JE: Oh, I know what you're look­

## ing for. [Laughs] One year, Brom

## decided he was going to dress up as

## me. He borrowed some of my clothes

## and stuff and, like, a bald wig and so

## forth. [Laughs] To be honest, I didn't

## realize it was supposed to be me un­

## til somebody told me. "Yeah, funny."

## Thar was funny. I wish

## known so

## I could have had retaliation in mind

## before he went.

## Before I get you into too much

## trouble with all these questions and

## without getting too teary-eyed, can

## you sum up your time, friendships,

## experienc

## ə, and ɚelinɛ about

## your

## time at TSR? Thar's a big one.

## ɜll, I certɝnly met a lot of peo-

## ple at TSR by way of just working at

## TSR. I worked with a lot of people. I was there for 20

## years. I don't think anybody else was in the art depart­

## ment that long. A lot of people came, a lot of people

## went, you know, and I still have contact with many to

## some degree and certainly consider them friends. It was

## certainly one of the best times of my life, you know. I

## never enjoyed going into work more than I did then.

## So it was probably a good experience getting to

## work there. There were no other environments really

## like that, were there? Ar FASA, maybe?

## JE: Well, that's true. I don't know of any other ... Of

## course, I don't know about all of them, but there are

## certainly no art departments now where everybody sits

## there and works traditionally, non-digitally, all day eve­

## ry day. We certainly fed off one another, you know. Of

## course, we were all young and ambitious . . .

## You weren't ruined by the world.

## JE: Yeah, that was later. But, yeah, it was a friendly

## competition. We all wanted to shine in the group so

## we all tried and usually put forth our best effort. Some­

## times, it just didn't happen, but for the most part, it was

## very inspirational, very motivational.

## Well, as an artist, some people have a magnum

## opus, their last hurrah. Have you done your magnum

## opus yet? Do you have a peak to end on?

## JE: Well, as far as a painting, you always like to think

## you've got the best one left in you, you know. Hopefully

## it's not going to be totally downhill from here. Like I

## say, there are a handful of my favorite paintings. I did

## one as a commission years ago. It was a 4'

## 6' paint­

## ing, which is one of the largest ones I've ever done. The

## "Siege of Lord Eyrie's Crag" painting. That was proba­

## bly one of the most impressive paintings I've ever done.

## That was actually just sup­

## posed to be a commission, not

## particularly for TSR, but they did

## buy the rights later?

## Yeah, I did it for a commission,

## but, yeah, I did sell them certain

## rights. They used it several times,

## maybe a DM screen and, at least,

## one

## Dragon

## magazine cover.

## Have you done many heavy

## metal album covers?

## If you mean that. ..

## Rhapsody of Fire?

## Correct, Rhapsody of Fire.

## What would the 10-year-old you

## be thinking of the work you've done?

## You've been published in all kinds of

## books and magazines, done covers ...

## Well, I certainly had long

## stretches of time when I thought

## that would never happen. At one

## point right out of college, I was all

## ready to start taking classes in

## re­

## pair, get a trailer in Bowling Green,

## Kentucky, and make the best of it.

## But, luckily, one way or the other,

## the fates intervened and pulled me

## into the wilds of Wisconsin.

## Yeah, I guess, were they German?

## I was going to say it's never too

## late, but I don't think anyone does

## repair anymore, so maybe it is

## Italian, Italian. They were an Italian

## band. Yeah, they contacted me some

## too late. [Laughs]

## years ago and had me do a cover [for 2006's

## Triumph or

## Agony].

## That was fun. Nothing else ever came of it, but it

## was fun to do the one.

## Anything else on your artistic bucket list that you

## desperately need to do?

## If I were left to my own devices, I would probably

## build stuff, at least for a while. I spent so many years

## just painting, and I do have an interest in building and

## sculpting stuff. If it were for enjoyment, I would prob­

## ably lean into something like that before I got back into

## painting again, unless something came up that I really

## felt like I had to do.

## Yeah, I know. [Laughs]

## All right. Well, thanks a lot for your interview, in­

## sight, and wisdom, Jeff.

## Sure! Okay.

## Chris Arneson grew up in Wisconsin just 30 short minutes

## from TSR, though it wasn't until attending college at UW­

## Whitewater that the close proximity sank in. By that time,

## he had long since fallen in love with Dungeons

## Dragons

## and its art. He was hooked after getting the Ero! Otus Basic

## box set and the

## Endless Quest

## book

## Dungeon of Dread.

## The Art of the Dragonlance Saga

## put Chris on his path

## of trying to become a fantasy artist. Since Chris was local

## he was incredibly lucky to hook up with game designers

## Jim Ward, Lester Smith, and Tim Brown after TSR closed

## to do some freelance art for their company, Fast Forward

## Entertainment. Soon after, Chris did work for the Legend

## of the Five Rings, Wheel of Time, and Rifts CC Gs, among

## others. Currently Chris is relishing in the work he gets to

## do for Joseph Goodman of Goodman Games. You can find

## his illustrations in this very book!

## 1: 1he Village of Hommlet

## was first published in

## 1979, with a monochrome cover. The second and

## third printings also featured a monochrome cov­

## er, with the only changes depicted on the covers. The

## fourth printing occurred in 198 1  and featured full art

## on the cover and back with a light green cover, along

## with the new TSR logo. The fourth through seventh

## printings were virtually the same, although the map on

## the last page was inverted from the sixth to the seventh

## printings.

## The sequel, T2, was hinted at, but was delayed six

## years! It was finally released as the supermodule

## 1he Temple of Elemental Evil.

## Rumor has it the mod­

## ule codes WG 1 and WG2 were set aside for

## 1he Village

## of Hommlet

## and

## 1he Temple of Elemental Evil

## but were

## never used.

## 1he Temple of Elemental Evil

## had seven printings,

## a testament to its popularity. Some editions were even

## reprinted years following the release of the second edi­

## tion of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons in 1989. The

## first printing was August 1985 (as listed on the tide

## page). The second printing corrected some of the textu­

## al errors in the book. The third through fifth printings

## were very similar except for minor changes to the cov­

## ers. The fourth printing was in 1987. The sixth (1991)

## and seventh (1992) printings featured the updated gold

## TSR logo.

## Interestingly, three of the popular supermodules were

## edited to form a single epic campaign arc. T1-4 was

## designed to lead into

## -

## : Scourge of the Slavelords

## and

## then into

## GDQJ-7: Queen of the Spiders.

## The content

## of Al-4 was revised slightly to suit 7th- to 1 1th-level

## characters to bridge the gap between the other two.

## Information of these printings was summarized from

## The Acaeum, an online site for D&D collectors. For

## more information, visit

## www.acaeum.com.

## When converting a classic late '70s or early '80s module

## into the latest Original Adventures Reincarnated book,

## we often uncover minor mistakes, missed edits, and in­

## consistencies. This was certainly true for both

## Expedition to the Barrier Peaks

## and

## : 1he Lost

## City.

## But in converting

## 1he Temple of Elemental

## Evil,

## we discovered many of these "oddities," so our

## crack editor Tim started a list to track them all, includ­

## ing how we resolved them (or not). Although these in­

## consistencies lend to the charm and mystique of such

## a classic book, over the years it has led to frustration,

## especially to those Dungeon Masters interested in run­

## ning this module for the next generation of gamer.

## How does this occur in such a beloved book which is

## considered a legacy in the storied history of Dungeons

## & Dragons? We postulate several reasons. Back in the

## late '70s, TSR did not have access to modern comput­

## ers and software such as Word and Excel with handy

## features like Find and Replace, Track Changes, spelling

## and grammar checks, etc. Don't underestimate the lack

## of a spreadsheet to track and manage all the moving

## parts of such a massive product. And it was massive;

## clocking in at 128 pages, it is considered one of the first

## mega-dungeons and was called a "supermodule." Fur­

## ther,

## 1he Village of Hommlet was

## released in 1979,

## while Tl-4 did not come along until 1985, SIX years

## later. Urban legend has it that Gary Gygax turned over

## his extensive notes on the dungeons below the Tem­

## ple to Frank Mentzer to organize and further develop.

## Anyone who has worked on a project team knows how

## that goes. The credits page lists FIVE editors on the

## manuscript. Invariably, mistakes were going to creep in

## with that many "designers and editors in the dungeon."

## Did we catch all of them? Probably not, but our goal

## was to make the adventure and the story as approacha-

## ble as possible, without taking a heavy-handed approach

## to re-writes. What follows is a list of many of the incon­

## sistencies we uncovered, what we did about them, and

## sometimes the "why."

## In area I 13 of the Inn of the Welcome Wench in

## Hommlet, "Furnok's funds consist of a small hoard of

## 37 gems worth 50 gp each (three bloodstones, eight car­

## nelians, four chalcedon, four citrines, six onyx, and nine

## zircons), and 12 sp and 12 gp for gambling." That is

## only 34 gems, so we adjusted it accordingly.

## The map of the Guard Tower in Hommlet had several

## issues, particularly areas G 10 to G 12. First, the label

## for area G 10 is on the wrong floor; it should be on the

## parapet level in the large space with the

## markings

## surrounding areas GS and G9. Areas G 1 1  and G 12 were

## labeled G 10 and G

## respectively; thus, G 12 wasn't on

## the map but was described in the text. These are now

## correctly labeled, and we added "S" markings for the

## two scorpions on the roof (area G 12).

## In the Moathouse Dungeons, we had a few minor issues.

## Area 26A was not labeled; instead there were two area

## 26s on the map. In area 27, the bugbears know that La­

## reth is "to the north" but his quarters are clearly south of

## the bugbears' location. And finally, the area 34 descrip­

## tion says there is an extra room in the northeast corner,

## but that should be the southwest corner. All these issues

## were addressed. One thing we did not change was Lar­

## eth's deity. The text states he serves Lolth, but the Spi­

## der Queen is not mentioned anywhere in the Temple of

## Elemental Evil. This does seem to be inconsistent, with

## Zuggtmoy or Iuz being his likely deity as they are the

## main players at the Temple. It's possible Lareth was an

## agent for the Spider Queen, there to monitor her ene­

## mies, so we kept it as originally written. [Author's Note:

## This was how the character was treated in the official

## novelization

## (The Temple of Elemental Evil

## by Thomas

## M. Reid, 2001), which I was quite fond of. - Chris.]

## In the Interlude: Hommlet to Nulb section, there were

## several different distances described in various parts in

## the module and they did not all align with the overland

## map. We settled on "about a two days' journey afoot"

## for this in our chapter 6 and adjusted our new overland

## map accordingly.

## The material that became chapter 8 had a few parts that

## needed to be adjusted. The Exterior Notes section says,

## "The thrown down works and razed buildings are shown

## on the map by X marks." Yet, there aren't any "X" marks

## on the map. We didn't bother fixing this and just elimi­

## nated the "by X marks" phrase, assuming the DM can fig­

## ure it out on their own. Regarding the Broken Tower, the

## escape tunnel "bears generally west" but the map shows

## it exiting the tower to the northeast. For this conversion,

## we altered the text and added a sharp curve in the tunnel's

## path, in a separate map. We also fully detailed the aban­

## doned farmhouse and the well where the escape tunnel

## exits.

## The description of the Upper Temple says it is 450 feet

## across at its widest point but if you look at the map you

## can see the structure is only 360 feet wide (12 squares

## at 30 feet per square). Area 10 of the Upper Temple had

## a few issues. First, the original states the throne sinks

## to area 352, but really it sinks to area 340. It also re­

## fers to the

## Orb of Golden Death

## as the

## Orb of Elemental

## Death.

## This is confusing in part because this artifact has

## many names, including the

## Yellowskull,

## the

## Goldenskull,

## and the

## Death Orb.

## These four names are all used inter­

## changeably, but

## Orb of Elemental Death

## is not one of the

## names. This was an easy fix, but for continuity to the

## original, we kept all the other names intact. There was

## no need for a fifth name. It also states the

## Orb's

## location

## is area 322 but that should be area 338.

## Confused yet? Just imagine if you were a teen-aged DM

## in 1986 trying to figure all this out!

## Although Dungeon Level 1 didn't have any glaring

## inconsistencies, the same can't be stated for Dungeon

## Level 2. In area 209, we have a few minor descriptions

## snafus. First, the doors are described as brass, but later

## room descriptions describe them as bronze. We went

## with bronze, as it seemed more consistent in other doors

## throughout. Second, the descriptions of the pictured

## priests are incorrect. The original refers to "a square on

## a figure wearing silvery gray robes" and "a circle on a

## green-robed cleric." The elemental symbols should be a

## circle on the silvery gray robes and a square on the green

## robes.

## We'll be honest, area 210 is a mess. The original de­

## scription says the stairs in area 145 descend to here but

## in reality, they ascend to the ground level; the stairs in

## area 148 are the ones that actually descend to area 210.

## The overall room description is hard to understand as

## written, so after lengthy debate, we made some deci­

## sions. We decided the "great pierced square of bronze"

## is the point from where the alarm emanates. We're not

## sure what that pierced square is supposed to be, as the

## correct symbol for the Air Temple is a circle. There

## is

## a

## circle on the map but that could possibly be depicting

## the shaft in the ceiling up to area 131. Which is not

## properly aligned, by the way. (Count the squares-we

## did!) This misalignment was discovered late in the lay­

## out process, so we did not alter the maps as that would

## have distorted the Dungeon Level 2 map. And, we still

## are not clear what or where the dome is in this room.

## Two more minor things regarding area 210, which were

## easily addressed. The original text said items placed in

## the pit are teleported to area 526 in the Air Node, but

## the Air Node was never fully developed and did not

## use that numbering system. For OAR #6, we changed

## the destination to be area 1 in the Air Node. Area 21 Oa

## mentions the drelb as being a new monster in an ap­

## pendix, but it isn't described fully in the appendix or

## anywhere else in the book, so we decided to convert the

## entry in the AD&D

## Monster Manual II.

## We had a few more confusing Air Symbol issues on

## Dungeon Level 2. In area 223, the bugbears aligned

## with the Air Temple have gray cloaks adorned with "a

## large black square." We changed that to a circle, as that

## is the symbol for the Air Temple. Area 225 has an Air

## Temple robe that is "worked with crystal beads and jet

## to form black squares with shining centers." Again, to

## match the Air Symbol, we switched the shapes to circles.

## Dungeon Level 3 wasn't too bad. Area 307 mentions

## a "branched staff" described in area 427, but that area

## describes no such item. Perhaps that should have been

## area 417? (A reference to Hedrack's room, and his

## mace

## of smiting?)

## For OAR #6, we changed it to where the

## leucrotta won't attack anyone obviously attached to the

## Greater Temple or carrying a black scarab.

## In area 334, Prince Thrommel is a paladin but his

## unique sword

## Fragarach

## is listed as a sentient chaotic

## good sword, which is unusual since paladins in AD&D

## were traditionally lawful good. After going back and

## forth, for OAR we made Thrommel and

## Fragarach

## both

## lawful good despite paladins not being restricted to that

## alignment in fifth edition.

## In area 353b a niche appears to be in the south wall

## according to the map. However, the text indicates the

## niche is in the west wall. That was an easy fix.

## Regarding Zuggtmoy's imprisonment on Dungeon Lev­

## el 3, there were several contradictions. These include:

## • Area 339: "Now, however, the demoness is prevented

## from entering this hall until all four of the sealed por­

## tals are broken."

## • Area 340: "Zuggtmoy cannot enter this Audience

## Hall unless three gates have been sundered: the Grand

## Entrance (above ground, area 1), Earth Temple (area

## 145), and Octagonal Chamber (210)."

## • Area 353: "If the lowest gate (340) is sundered, Zug­

## gtmoy is no longer imprisoned in area 353 (A and B),

## but is freed to roam the entire north dungeon (areas

## 339-353)."

## We felt the need to clarify and simplify this to "If the

## lowest gate (see area 340) is sundered, Zuggtmoy is no

## longer imprisoned in areas 353a and 353b, and is free

## to roam the entire north dungeon (areas 339 through

## 353)."

## Most of the confusing issues we discovered on Dun­

## geon Level 4 were directly related to the maps. For ex­

## ample, several fireplaces mentioned in the text were not

## present on the map (areas 414, 41 5, and 417). In area

## 419, the discussion on the "Ceremonial Activity" seems

## to be backwards. It said the creatures summoned from

## the Plane of Fire emerge in area 427, but that area has

## a gate to the Fire Node, not the Plane of Fire. It then

## goes on to say they proceed to area 426, but that's just

## a hallway. We presume the original intent was for them

## to proceed to area 427, which has the gate to the Fire

## Node. Area 428 says it is identical to "area 428," when

## this obviously should refer to area 427.

## The text in area 434 refers the DM to read area 429's

## description if the pillar is touched, but the pillar section

## is actually in area 435. Similarly, area 435 refers back to

## the Great Hall at area 364 but the Great Hall is actually

## area 353.

## The Nodes in the original module were not fully devel­

## oped, so there were few errors here. In the Introduc­

## tion section, it says each gate in the dungeon can send

## "up to eight human-sized beings," but the actual gate

## descriptions say 10. We went with 10 and switched it

## to Medium-sized creatures to align with modern con­

## ventions. The Transportation section refers back to area

## 35 1 (twice!) but that area doesn't have a portal or gate.

## We fixed that to refer to area 339 in both instances. In

## the Water Node, there was a mix-up with the compass

## direction descriptions of a few of the seas. Area 5 was

## labeled "Northwest sea," but it is in the northeast car-

## ner of the Node. Area 8 was labeled "West sea, north

## branch," but clearly it should be the East Sea. Same with

## area 1 1 .

## I'll admit that is quite a list. Does it make the original

## module unplayable? No, and if anything, it even adds

## to the charm of the original work and its storied path

## to get to publication. In the perfect world, Mr. Gygax

## would have had the time to focus on the manuscript,

## meeting its original publication date, but the pressures

## of running a successful company booming in a fledgling

## industry conspired to delay the project several times. The

## solution was to bring Mr. Mentzer into the fold to push

## this supermodule across the finish line. Based on the

## history of what happened to Mr. Gygax and TSR a few

## weeks following its publication, we should be thankful

## the original design team made this a priority for the fans.

## Otherwise, the tale might have ended in the Moathouse

## Dungeons.

LaSalle 0 ne of the best Dungeons & Dragons battles I ever adjudicated took place right there in the Moathouse, kicking off my return to the Temple of Elemental Evil in unforgettable style. My buddies and I played 7he Village of Hommlet when we were kids, making up new characters for the occasion. The inscrutable Michael Dion, my first truly great DM, ran the adventure, making the tiny town feel like a place full of spies and secrets. We fought bad guys in the Welcome Wench, bought equipment that never existed in our D&D world before (I recall that suddenly everyone owned a length of chain and had nothing to do with it), and spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was really going on. I remember the wonderful moment when we came back from the Moathouse loaded with loot, so excited about how the formerly aloof Burne and Rufus would have to give us a little respect now. I mean, I had backstabbed Lareth the Beautiful and come home wearing an elven cloak. A5 we used to say back then, after our victory you couldn't tell me nothing. Our foray into Hommlet wound up kicking off a long se­ ries of adventures with those characters, that (as I recall) ended halfway through White Plume Mountain, when my family moved to Texas. I picked up 7he Temple of Elemental Evil soon after we moved and scoured its pages but mostly used it for ideas, because at that point I was running noth­ ing but homebrew in my D&D game (mostly using ideas stolen from 7he Savage Sword of Conan and the Lankhmar books, naturally). I didn't go back to the Moathouse until my return to Dun­ geons & Dragons in 2000, when the third edition lured me back into the fold. I was so excited when Return to the Tem­ ple of Elemental Evil came out. I wore that book out with a highlighter and declared that it would be the first cam­ paign I meant to run after my return to Georgia. I had six fairly consistent players-remember when you could get six folks at the table at the same time for year's worth of adven­ tures?-and we started with that walk through Hommlet. That felt like coming home. Soon after one of my all-time favorite Dungeons & Drag­ ons battles took place, there at the Moathouse when my guys fell prey to Utreshimon, the blue dragon. Later on, we would say that that dragon had absolutely no place at that dungeon, that it was much too powerful for starting characters. I saw a lot of abilities on display for the first time in that game. The blue dragon opened up with a lightning bolt attack against the thief-who saved, and wound up tak­ ing zero damage. A first-edition thief would have died no doubt. I remember thinking how cinematic it was-I could see the thief falling into a split and dodging the lightning bolt, which would go on to scorch the inner wall of the Moathouse. Then I got to watch as my old gaming friend I adversary Don charged up for what would have been the first ever smite attack I had ever seen ... if he hadn't fumbled. "Oh, that's pathetic," howled Don at the guilty die. Don was famous for his uncanny dice luck. I ruled that the paladin had fallen, and on the dragon's next action he put a giant claw on the paladin and just held him there, fighting the others with his bite and claws. The ranger went down, got healed, and then went down again. Everyone looked around the table-was the whole party going to die here? It was very, very possible that the second night of our campaign would be its last. But two rounds later the paladin made an amazing Strength check and freed himself He got back in the fight, scoring a big hit. Later that round the sorcerer hit the dragon with her last magic missile, also scoring big damage. Sensing the turning of the tide, the dragon tried to flee but the monk struck an extremely lucky attack of opportunity with his quarterstaff. Endgame, and the dragon falls. I remember the palpable relief when the dragon finally went down, high fives and that wonderful laughter. 0zjGiIIAL ADVEIITVjS REiIICAR._IIATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELElhEIITAL EVIL Bloody, bedraggled, out of spells and resources, the PCs had survived to fight another day. That's how a fight with a dragon should go. I ran that adventure every week for more than a year, but by the time we had reached the Inner Fane schedules changed and we had to move locations and nights, and we took a break. We said we would pick the adventure up again-I mean, we had made it to the Inner Fane!-but soon after that Xcrawl became my life and we never revisited the ad­ venture. Looking back on The Temple of Elemental Evil, I see a prime example of Gygaxian design, a style that I sometimes, per­ haps wrongly, call "grumpy old D&D." The Temple is a true crawl, where you had best check for traps, search for secret doors, and occasionally run from enemies that are simply too strong to be defeated head-on, or you will per­ ish. You have to crawl smart, but you also have to be smart about how you deal with Hommlet and your new allies as well, because some of your "friends" are undoubtably serv­ ants of the Temple. You have to be a good dungeoneer and role-player to survive. Tim Wadzinski (right; with his mom) circa 1983, sporting his prized AD&D lizardman jersey that was purchased for him by his grandmother. He is clearly thinking he'd rather be elsewhere, perhaps even behind a DM screen. Chris Doyle (center) is the Dungeon Master for a game run in a basement (of course) circa 1987. Devin Mc­ cullen (right) just did something exciting, while Craig Rura (left) looks on. The split in the DM screens was so that Chris could easily access the cheese doodles (not pictured) and Coca-Cola, both staples at the game table in the mid-198os. That's my kind of gaming. It is my sincere hope that this new edition becomes the home campaign for new generations of young gamers, now innocent of all the horror and wonder that hides around every corner of Hommlet and the Temple. I want them to learn their gamer skills here, and to bring them along on a thousand new adventures. Watch out for that dragon, friends. Brendan J LaSalle is a writer, game designer, and odd-job man who had the good fortune to discover his true calling in 1977 when he was introduced to AD&D. He is the author of several DCC adventures and supplements for Goodman Games, Fat Dragon, Savage Mojo, Hand Made Games, Pan­ dahead Publishing, Troll Lords Games, and others. He is best known as the creator of Xcrawl, the dungeon-adventure-cum­ alternative-modern-death-sport he has published since 2012.

There are a lot of reasons why this is so, but I think, more than anything, it is the module's ominous, brooding character. Unlike, say, the titular Keep from The Keep on the Borderlands, Hommlet genuinely feels like it's a community that sits on the precipice of dis­ aster. Though the forces of Good carried the day and defeated the hordes of Elemental Evil a decade ago, the victory was not total and everyone in Hommlet knows it-even if they dare not speak the truth. The ruins of the Moathouse are stirring again and agents of Elemental Evil have infiltrated the village. Everyone understands it's only a matter of time before Evil will again rear its ugly head; it's simply a question of when and whether Hommlet will emerge from the coming battle intact. There's something powerful about this set-up, some­ thing that strikes me as the perfect starting point for a new campaign. I share with Tolkien the conception of history as a "long defeat" and The Village of Hommlet touches on that theme obliquely-the notion that each generation must stare Evil in the face and bar the way of its advance, even though it's at best just a holding action, for Evil can never truly be defeated in this life. Obviously, I'm reading more into this module than Gary Gygax likely intended, but that's part of the point of this essay: module Tl (as it was known when I first encountered it) inspired in me a lot of thoughts and feelings that I find incredibly useful in kicking off a new fantasy role-playing game campaign. I cannot recall precisely when I first laid eyes on The Village of Hommlet. At the earliest, it would have been 1981, since that's the publication date of the later print­ ing of the module with the green cover. Regardless of the date, I bought and used the module with great suc­ cess and looked forward to its sequel. The cover of the module proclaimed that The Village of Hommlet is "a /sf Le.ve.I D'" 101 It_ s ··+· • • The author's own sequel to T1, designed before T2 was pub- lished. • • lead-in to DUNGEON MODULE T2, T HE TEM- PLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL." T2, as originally con­ ceived, never appeared and I regret that. When we fi­ nally did get The Temple of Elemental Evil, it was very different from the module I had expected it to be and, in my opinion, not much like the module Gygax would have written had he done so in 1979, as planned. The long gap between the publication of Tl and its eventual sequel gave me plenty of time to come up with my own conception of the Temple of Elemental Evil, a conception that bore little resemblance to what we 0R.iGinAL ADVEil'f'VjS REinCAR_IlA'f'ED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEllTAL EVIL finally saw in 1985. To come up with my own version, I scoured the pages of The Village of Hommlet for any details I could find about the nature of the Temple and its inhabitants, no matter how small-which is pretty much all anyone could do, since Tl provides little in the way of concrete information. We learn, for exam­ ple, that the Temple's minions wore ochre-colored robes and that, in the final battle against the forces of Good, they employed "a terrible demon." However, the iden­ tities of the Temple's leadership are not mentioned at all, nor is the precise nature of "elemental evil," which only piqued my interest more. The Master of the Moat­ house, Lareth the Beautiful, is stated to have some kind of connection to the demoness Lolth, but whether that means she was involved with the Temple of Elemental Evil or not is left to the imagination. Rather than frustrate me, the lack of explicit details about the Temple within the pages of Tl inspired me. I began to consider alternative ways to understand the paltry hints Gygax gave us in The Village of Hommlet. There were so many possibilities that I found it difficult to settle on a single one. The key to my making sense of it was seeing the original monochrome cover of the module for the first time, which happened several years after I'd purchased my own copy. Drawn by the late, great Dave Trampier, the cover depicts wnat I assume are the bandits from the Moathouse, as well as Lareth the Beautiful, wielding his mace and staff of striking. The armor of both Lareth and the bandits is embla­ zoned with a flaming eye symbol. Was this the symbol of the Temple of Elemental Evil? If it were, what did this suggest about the Temple? Immersed as I was in Dungeons & Dragons and its lore at the time, the eye symbol immediately reminded me of the manifestation of the Elder Elemental God in Gygax's earlier module, Hall of the Fire Giant King. Unsurprisingly, there are no details about the Elder El­ emental God beyond the fact that the draw worship it, a fact reinforced (and complicated) in Vault of the Drow, where it is stated that the Elder Elemental God is a rival of Lolth among the dark elves. While I was still uncertain about all the specifics, it now seemed obvious to me that the Elder Elemental God had some connec­ tion to the Temple of Elemental Evil (though I was still baffled, given the mention of Lolth in Lareth's entry in Tl). So many mysteries! Armed with these paltry details, I set out to make my own version of the Temple of Elemental Evil to use in my home campaign. I pulled out a piece of graph paper and went to work, producing the first of several im­ agined levels. That first level, a reproduction of which accompanies this essay, is quite small, as you can see, consisting of only 28 numbered areas. Though the key associated with it has long since vanished, I can still remember a few of them, most notably area 7, which is filled with magical pools a la module Bl: In Search of the Unknown (the first dungeon module I owned and whose design has influenced me ever since). There's also the very odd compass rose, which places south at the top rather than north. The level has two entrances (IA and lB), both of which are accessed by means of stairs from the surface, which reminds me that I'd imagined thoroughly destroyed surface ruins resting atop the dungeons I was mapping. I spent a lot of time imagining what the Temple of Elemental Evil might be like, mapping out (I think) three subterranean levels, and beginning to key them. I eventually stopped, after events in my home campaign shifted away from Hommlet and its surrounds, but I held on to the work I'd already done, hoping that I'd one day have the chance to use it. Regardless, I'd had a great deal of fun thinking about the Temple, based largely on the snippets The Village of Hommlet provided, which probably explains yet another reason why I hold that adventure module in such high regard. For me, the value of a module isn't simply in the information and ideas it contains, but in the way that the information and ideas inspire me to come up with my own. By that measure, Tl is one of the greatest modules ever written. James Maliszewski started role-playing in the late Fall of 1979, when he opened up a copy of the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set edited by Dr. J Eric Holmes originally purchased for his father. More than 40 years later, he's still playing. James is known for his blog Grognardia, which was the focal point of the OSR movement in its early days. His memories and musings about role-playing games and related nonsense, as well as articles about the history of the hobby from its earliest beginnings to the present day, re­ main of interest to readers to this day 0NGiIIAL ADVEII'tVkS REiIICARJIAfED • THE TEJl:rPLE 0F ELEJl:rEIITAL EVIL GaryGygax,TSR,and the Temple of Elemental Evil by Jon Peterson T he story of The Temple of Elemental Evil is, in many respects, the story of the first decade of Dungeons & Dragons itself. Gary Gygax conceived of the Temple when D&D was still a small hobby, at a time when no one yet sold adventure modules. Later, its name was teased in products just as D&D became a mainstream phenomenon, from which point Gygax had so many demands on his time that work on it stag­ nated until he enlisted Frank Mentzer to see the thing finished-which it was, but just weeks before Gygax himself would be ousted from TSR. Its development cycle practically mirrors Gygax's career at TSR. In the spring of 1976, TSR had only just turned from a hobby into a career. The company had newly occupied a building, at 723 Williams Street in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. Just the previous October had Gygax and his partner Brian Blume begun to bring on full-time staff, the likes of Tim Kask and Terry Kuntz, and then Dave Arneson, Mike Carr, and Dave Megarry. With all of these gamers on hand, there were going to be games around the office. They played Napoleonic min­ iature wargames, they played Fight in the Skies, and, as Gygax would write in a note on April 19, "I am ready­ ing a small fantasy campaign." Gygax's new campaign was set in the fictional world we would later call the World of Greyhawk-the first references to Oerth began to appear in Dragon this year-which contained Dave Arneson's Blackmoor and Gygax's own City of Greyhawk. Its earliest maps always show Nyr Dyv, the "Lake of Bottomless Depths," and this new campaign would be set near its shores where "a cult of chaotic evil flourished." Chaotic evil, inciden­ tally, was a fairly new idea at the time, as Gygax's four­ fold-model of alignment had only just been unveiled in the February 1976 issue of 1he Strategic Review. This cult had occupied a "Lost Temple of Elemental Evil," and its 1976 description was among the few original artifacts that were still on hand when 1he Temple of El- emental Evil was finally published in 1985, so it was reprinted almost verbatim on the right-hand column of page 27. Adjacent to the Temple was an unfortunate town called Hommlet, which lived ever under the threat that the evil of the Temple would rise again. Many of the townspeople were non-player characters, but others were played by the core team that worked out of 723 Williams Street. Gygax mostly insisted that his players take on new characters, rather than the ones they had previously played in Greyhawk. So Dragon editor Tim Kask played the village priest, a druid who was originally known simply as "Tim, the Lusty Druid." Dave Arneson played the trader who lived to the northwest of Hommlet, on the road to Ver­ bobonc. Arneson developed lists of his stock and sup­ plies, and drew up a map of the trader's establishment, which was adapted into Map 4 in the 1985 edition of the Temple-as well as an illustration of what players would see when they walked in the door. Rob Kuntz was the exception to the rule, bringing his Greyhawk character Robilar to the Temple, and ultimately laying waste to it. The town of Hommlet had its share of intrigue, as agents of good and evil schemed to their advantages, but the main event was the Temple itself. The 1976 area map of the upper works shows the putatively aban­ doned Temple among a cluster of buildings in various states of disrepair. A ruined refectory to the northeast of the tower then contained a trapdoor, a way down into the dungeons below. But originally, there was no fixed underworld beneath the Temple. Gygax would later note, "I used some random dungeon generation methods as a test of the systems when I put the design together." The very first issue of TS R's Strategic Review magazine described a method for dynamically rolling up dungeon layouts on demand, an idea he was then refining. 0zjGiilAL ADVEilTVjS REiilCAR_IlATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEilTAL EVIL SoT e pe iod of nany yeb-s a cu t of chaotic evil flourishc' somevheĔe on ĕhe shores of the .yr Dyu. lthough :he location of the Lemple is lost, these facts re er ing it, and ts followers, are known. Ėhe cult was based on the premise that t!'le elementr€!. forces of the universe are chaotic and opposed to . mankind, i.e. evil. ėhe tereple of the culĘsought to destroy all woręs of good and disrupt order. Its r.:embers were thieves, assassains, ·o!'igand s, and the like. Fire was regarded as the first elemental evil, and its perchant for chaotic occurrance fitted in with tbe precise of the cult. Likewise, water was worshipped as an even Ěore powerful force of chaotic evil, water in the form of floods, storms, and raging seas beating upon the land and sinking ships. The epitone of chaotic evil, however, was regarded as a combination of air and earth -- represented by black and corresponding with the Demonic Abyss. !his com­ bination was regarded as a complete negation of oatter. The cult grew powerful and rich, attracting followers of the worst sort, and offering safety to them within the walls of its temple stronghold. From this fortress these followers would ride forth to rob, pillage, and lay waste the lands thereabout, tithing the cult with the spoils of this brigandage. Captives from these raids were brought back to the temple to serve as human sacrifices (children to the fire, men to the water, women to the blackest evil) or to slave their lives away in bondage. Besides the extensive upper works of the temple a deep labyrinth beneath the place was constructed, but virtually nothing is now known about these dungeons other than that they were inhabited by creatures serving chaos and evil. It is rumored that a demon took un abode in the deeoest level in order to better receive the jacrifices - to him. Eventually the neighbors of this temple grew tired of t!1ese depradations. 1All good, lawful and chaotic, banded together to form a mighty host. Their army marched to the tempre, f::ghting two battles on the way. The first was inconclusive, although the forces of good held the field afterwards, so that they gained the reputation of victory, and their ranks were swelled by many men from the area. The second battle saw a great slaughter of kobolds, goblins, ores, hobgoBlins, evil men, and the like. The temple was thereafter besieged, fell, and all of its inhabitants were put to the sword. It is reported by some sources that the toop e and its precincts resisted complete destrucěion, but the majority staĜe that the whole was razed so that the cult could never em rge again nor any find where it had once flourished.

TSR itself would not get into the business of producing modules until 1978, when it turned its Origins and Gen Con tournaments of the year into the seminal G 1-3 Giants modules and Dl-3 Drow modules. Once the demand for modules became apparent, many other past tourna­ ments would be republished as modules-including an introductory installment of the setting of the 197 6 TSR office campaign, Tl: The Village of Hommlet. Its cover informs us that it is the "first of 2 modules" and that it serves as "a lead-in to Dungeon Module T 2, The Tem­ ple of Elemental Evil." Hommlet had grown since Gygax drew the original 1976 town map on a single 8.5'' x 11" sheet. As more people joined TSR, they too adventured in Hommlet: for example, Tim Jones, who came on staff in 1977, would play the cleric Terjon. The original map had no church to Saint Cuthbert, no brewer, no stonemason, and certainly not the guard tower and castle begun by Burne and Rufus, who were played by Ernie Gygax and Skip Williams, respectively. The "Lusty Druid" played by Tim Kask has been renamed Jaroo Ashstaff in Tl. Another thing that had changed since 1976 was that Dave Arneson no longer worked for TSR, and had recently sued the company. The trader in the 1979 Hommlet module, Rannos Davi, has a name that un­ scrambled into Arneson, and his assistant, Gremag, has a name suspiciously similar to that of Megarry, who re­ mained a close ally of Arneson's. They are portrayed in Tl as evil agents of the Temple, but the traders do hold an important clue, one that hints of the future direction of the Temple: "a small black scarab with the glyphs • • Arneson's perspective map of the Traders' Establishment. • • 'T ZGY,'" which is "a pass in an area of the Temple of Elemental Evil." The Village of Hommlet was released for Gen Con X II in 1979, along with the Dungeons Masters Guide and the module White Plume Mountain. It turned out to be a pivotal moment for the history of Dungeons & Dragons: shortly after Gen Con, the disappearance of 16-year-old college student James Dallas Egbert III dra­ matically catapulted the game into mainstream noto­ riety. Suddenly D&D product flew off the shelves of hobby stores, and the modest town of Hommlet found itself in the hands of many more eager gamers than any­ one could have expected. Given how heavily it was promoted in Tl, T 2  became one of TSR's most hotly anticipated products. When the World of Greyhawk folio came out for Gen Con in 1980, it delivered a few tantalizing hints of what would await. Its "Gazetteer" situates the village of Hommlet, and the Temple, in the Viscounty of Verbobonc, and names the great historical conflict that razed the Temple the "Battle of Emridy Meadows." It also helps us de­ code the curious black scarab marked "T ZGY" in Tl, explaining that after the fall of the Temple (spoiler alert) "the demoness Tsuggtmoy (or Zuggtmoy) was impris­ oned in the ruins of the place, with special wards to prevent her escape." She, it would transpire, was the great evil lurking in the heart of the Temple. In 1980, Gygax had generated around 100 pages of draft material for T 2. The environs ofVerbobonc grew over that time, as now a town called Nulb acted as a buffer between the somewhat stable community of Hommlet and the evil of the Temple. In place of the randomly generated dungeons he used back in 1976, Gygax now had begun working on four levels of a dun­ geon: the "Interdicted Prison of the Demoness Zuggt­ moy" was sealed into the third level. The key to enter­ ing the prison lay in a variety of mystical wards, as well as with four elemental "nodes" accessible through the Temple, which were originally called the Air Cavern, the Earth Burrows, the Fire Pits, and the Water Maze. But when could Gygax find the time to finish it? He now was the president of a thriving medium-sized busi­ ness, with revenues doubling or even quadrupling each year. It was a time when Gygax wrestled with whether he really wanted to be a game designer or a business executive, and most of the time, the demands of the 0R,jGiIIAL ADVEII'fVjS REiIICAR._IIATED • THE TElb:PLE 0F ELElb:EIITAL EVIL business took precedence. He would promise in the November 1981 Dragon, "Yes, Virginia, I am work­ ing on it, and T2 will be out no later than Gen Con XV"-which would be the summer of 1982. And yes, the original specification of Zuggtmoy as the "Demo­ ness Lady of Fungi" (which would appear in the 1985 Temple on page 123) is dated as a "rev. 11 /81," evidence of his continuing efforts to get it over the finish line. Early in 1983, Gygax could inform Dragon magazine that he only needed about five more weeks of work on the Temple project, which was "formerly designated as module T2 but which will be released as WG 2, part 1 and 2." The "WG" series stood for the World of Grey­ hawk, but the original modules slated to be released in the series never appeared: WG4 would be the first. However, finding those five weeks simply was not in the cards for Gygax:, as the spring of 1983 would mark a major shift for TSR: the company underwent a signifi­ cant reorganization, which led to Gygax: refocusing his effort on media opportunities out in California. Gygax: had long been grooming Frank Mentzer to take over responsibility for the design of D&D going for­ ward-Mentzer's revised Basic Rules released in 1983 demonstrate him helming TSR's flagship product. So in the autumn of 1984, we should not be surprised when Gygax reported, "Frank also has the 300 or so pages of the manuscript for module T2 (Temple of Elemen­ tal Evil)-a bequeathal of guess who." Mentzer had the difficult job of updating much of the early work on the Temple for the contemporary D&D system (Unearthed Arcana would come out before it, say), but his job was not merely a clerical one: he filled in a number of gaps and added several key elements to the Temple. To give just one example, the due poem given of page 44 of the 1985 Temple was one of Mentzer's contributions. Thanks to Mentzer's efforts, and Gygax's willingness to delegate, The Temple of Elemental Evil finally arrived for Gen Con XVIII, in late August 1985. They called it a "supermodule" because of its sprawling length-TSR bundled it with a reprint of The Village of Hommlet, as the Hommlet setting was so crucial to the game. The whole project would be coded as modules Tl-4, with the intent of providing a sandbox where starting adven­ turers could advance to 8th level. Mentzer himself ran a hastily assembled tournament version of it at Gen Con, and his name appears on the cover of the module after Gygax:'s. Sadly, the release of the Temple marked the end of an era atTSR: just eight weeks later, Gary Gygax left the com­ pany in a dramatic boardroom showdown. He retained enough control over the World of Greyhawk to at least publish fiction related to it, and his "Gord the Rogue" series would feature Zuggtmoy as a major figure in nov­ els like Artifact of Evil (1986). But even after Gygax could no longer work with TSR, the Temple lived on. After TSR was purchased by Wizards of the Coast, they frequently revisited it, as in the Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil (2001). Atari published a computer game version of the original module in 2003. Today, D&D continues to tap into the concepts of "Elemental Evil" in adventures like Princes of the Apocalypse; Zug­ gtmoy can be found in Out of the Abyss and Morden­ kainen's Tome of Foes. And in this volume, you can see both the original, Advanced D&D-era Temple, as well as experiencing a version updated for today. You will be treading a path walked by the originators of Dungeons & Dragons, a rare intersection that nearly everyone re­ sponsible for the original game touched in some way. Whether that cult of elemental evil will rise again is now in your hands.

The adventure captures a milestone in D&D's evolution: the birth of the TSR "supermodule" and precursor of the adventure path, even as Gary Gygax handed the reins of the iconic adventure to Frank Mentzer. The re­ sult was nothing short of a triumph, a mega-dungeon fully worthy of the tide. As a young gamer (innocent enough to convince my­ self that the Savant-Sage and Pluffet Smedger the El­ der were real!) I devoured the richness of the Temple's history. The wealth of bizarre names and intersecting backstories set the standard for how I imagined settings should be designed. It would rake me decades to con­ sider that perhaps PCs' own actions could drive that backstory-adventures becoming history, and history informing adventures-rather than requiring a com­ pleted setting, neatly orchestrated by the judge. Later, as a DM, Temple was something of a (un)holy grail, a massive undertaking worthy of the tide of Ad­ vanced Dungeons & Dragons. There was no mistaking this massive delve for the readily segmented Caves of Chaos. Instead, Temple's hundreds of rooms offered a seemingly endless series of encounters to thwart and harry adventurers. The mere act of exploring the dun­ geon threatened to release the fell demoness from her eternal prison. The seven factions, each vying for su­ premacy within the Temple, set the stage for internecine conflict far beyond my 12-year-old ability to apprehend nuance in the battle of Good versus Evil. Taken as a whole, it isn't surprising that the adventure's scope ex­ ceeded my youthful enthusiasm, or that most of our delving involved quickly scanning the treasure totals of the next encounter to determine whether or not the pending encounter was worth the reward. Finally, as a writer, Temple has always beckoned, like the demons atop the posts in Keith Parkinson's brilliant cover illustration. It speaks to Parkison's talent and skill that-devoid of any adventurers or foes-the illustra­ tion "simply" depicts the Temple, and a single, robed form moving in the mists ahead of a gathering storm. Arguably the finest cover of its era, it beggars any au­ thor's attempt to match it with mere words, and lays truth to the maxim that it is art that drives RPGs. How often has a designer, musing on the cover of Temple, yearned to write a passage that conveys one tenth of the malevolence and mystery promised in Parkinson's painting? We've all fallen short. In my own contributions to the collective body of role­ playing games, it is difficult to overstate the influence of Temple. The keep of chaos in DCC RPG #67: Sail­ ors on the Starless Sea was designed to evoke memories • THE LOST TSR Jh:ODVLE! THE Jh:OATHOVSE The cover to TS R's 1984 release ACS: Player Character Re­ cord Sheets bears a striking resemblance to a scene from The Temple of Elemental Evil. Was it in fact an illustration that was originally intended for other purposes-per­ haps even as the cover to a never-released adventure Tz? In an effort to find out, we asked legendary TSR artist Clyde Caldwell, who painted the image. "This painting was the first painting I did after coming on staff at TSR," Clyde told us. "If memory serves, it was supposed to be used as the cover of a module called The Moathouse. So that was the title I kept for the painting. For whatever reason the painting wasn't used for quite a while. I don't know if the module was canceled, or if it appeared with a different cover, or if the module's name was changed. No one ever told me. It was later used on the Player Character Record Sheets." TS R's art director at that time, Jim Roslof, has unfortu­ nately passed away. We were unable to verify any more information about The Moathouse. It's a tantalizing bit of history regarding a TSR adventure that never came to be. • • • 0R,jGiI1.A.L ADVEI1TVjS REiI1C.A.R.I1.A.TED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEllTAL EVIL Was this painting originally intended to be the cover art to T2: The Moathouse before TSR re purposed it for ACS: Player Character RecordsR 0zjGiIIAL ADVEIITVRJ:S REiIICAR..IIATED • THE TElhPLE 0F ELElhEilTAL EVIL Opening scene from Dungeon Crawl Classics #67: Sailors on the Starless Sea, designed to evoke memories of the Moathouse. 0R.iGiIIAL A.DVEII'fVRJ;S REiIICARJIATED • THE TEJl:PLE 0F ELEJl:EnTA.L EVIL of the Moathouse. The dungeon levels depart radically (conjuring, instead, Erol Otus's illustration in the Ba­ sic D&D rulebook) but the surface layout resembles the Tl fortification if it had been rotted out from the inside, collapsing under its own weight and the raw ma­ levolence of chaos. The homage is so palpable that Clyde Caldwell's draft cover of Tl (ultimately used as the cover for TSR's AC 5: Player Character Record Sheets) would serve as an ad­ mirable cover for Sailors, or even an iteration of Stefan Poag's iconic frontispiece. Here Tl's giant frogs can be easily reimagined as anuran beastmen, and the thorns and sickly vines as the vine horrors in Sailors. Each illustration sounds the same clarion call: fallen grandeur jealously guarding mysteries of a bygone age; an overgrowth of sickly vines and thorny branches, that conceal death and decay; the certitude that whatever lurks inside the ruins is surely beyond mortal ken. Tem­ ple delivers on these promises, and if Sailors-my first adventure written for the DCC RPG-succeeds in do­ ing the same perhaps I can be forgiven for the homage. Fitting then, that DCC RPG # 100: The Music of the Spheres (is Chaos) should also owe a debt to The Temple of Elemental Evil. Astute readers are sure to note key parallels: cultists dedicated to the annihilation of Good; a terrible foe, progressively empowered by reckless PCs exploring the dungeon; and a maddeningly challeng­ ing dungeon sure to thwart all but the most careful of cartographers; and most obviously, the elemental nodes and their masters. So how does one write an element-themed adventure in the footsteps of Temple, the fourth greatest adventure of all time? For DCC #100, the path was clear. Eschewing Temple's hordes of vying factions, Spheres instead stakes its flag firmly on the fringes of occult spiritual science without troubling itself overmuch with alchemy's extensive history. (The true adventure delving into the alchymical wed­ ding of science and art is yet to be written, hopefully by a better scholar than this passing apprentice.) And in lieu of multiple levels of sprawling dungeons, Spheres marches its spinning elemental wheels through Aereth's zodiac, transforming the challenges (and the PCs' powers) up and down the DCC RPG dice chain. So rather than a massive dungeon offering multiple lev­ els of challenges, Spheres does its work on the PCs, im­ proving and diminishing each class in turn. Can Spheres hope to deliver on the promises of its spirit­ ual antecedent? That final analysis will only be decided by the judges and gamers daring enough to run DCC #100 at their table. But whether Spheres succeeds or fails, it can stand proudly in the ambitious tradition of its ancestor and trailblazer: The Temple of Elemental Evil.

I remember the dusty street, the first farm­ houses, the people working in their gardens and fields. After a short walk, I passed the leatherworker's shop and came to the Inn of the Welcome Wench. The rich details were plain to see, in the main building, the barn, and then the people inside. I was soon en­ sconced in the inn with a room (for me and my NPCs) and down in the common hall picking up rumors of a Moathouse and something evil that lurked beyond the confines of the little village. That was my introduction to Hommlet and to the ad­ venture that would eventually become The Temple of Elemental Evil. Back in 1 975 or '76 my brother, Davis Chenault, ac­ quired the little brown D&D books for his birthday. One of my father's soldiers had given them to my mother as something her children might enjoy (he was headed off on a hardship tour and couldn't keep them). "Don't let them play too much" was the warning as she took the books. I don't remember him saying that, but I do remember the moment he gave me those books. It was all very odd to me. Davis plunged into the game and started playing immediately, or trying to. He played hell getting his friends on board, so eventually, about a year later, he convinced me to sit down and make some characters. Once I started rolling those dice, I never stopped and still do, regularly on Thursday nights. In those days Davis had enough money in pocket (from babysitting I think) that allowed him to scoop up just about any TSR product that came out. I spent my mea­ ger earnings on comic books (about Green Lantern and the Warlord most of all), almost never on the game. I didn't really have to, because he did, and did so with a gusto. He got the AD&D Monster & Treasure Assort­ ment at Sears, I remember that. He got the AD&D Players Handbook at some point and the AD&D Dun­ geon Masters Guide for some Christmas. He was always coming home with something or the other. I didn't pay much attention to what he bought as most of it was DM's stuff, so he didn't want me looking at it anyway. (In an aside, we were living at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in those days and bought our comics and games mostly at a small shop in some guy's basement, complete with old musty smelling walls and lamps hanging from the ceiling.) For that reason, I do not remember Tl: The Village of Hommlet coming into the house. But I do remember when my characters rambled down its dirty streets. I made fresh 1st-level characters (my own and a few NPCs) and entered the town ready for mayhem and dungeon crawling. We were fresh from the Giant series and had plunged into D 1, too (I think, it's been a few turns in the road since then), and those were slaughter­ houses, filled with giants and monsters at every turn. It was with those two adventures in mind that I entered the little village, ready for some monster to attack at any moment. But of course, nothing attacked my little band. I first met some farmers working in their gardens, then a leatherworker. Then came to the Inn of the Welcome Wench. Upon entering I encountered a host of people, with personalities and backstories. There were details here, details about common people that I hadn't quite encountered before. I didn't know it then, but that changed everything for me and the game we played. The game left the contested fields of wargames and sud­ denly was real. It was a half-told story. I had to meet people, who had names and backgrounds and whose stories mattered to some overarching theme with an elemental evil that was haunting the lands. It was all quite . . .  nebulous. To be sure, we had already been run­ ning games with NPCs, and that involved role-playing and the like. That was natural. But with Tl, a published adventure from TSR, it was confirmation that this game was so much more than any other game out there. The village map was so very real with trees, a lake, a mill on the stream, hills, and castles under construction. The inn was delivered to us in 3D; you could see the chairs 0NGiIIAL A-DVEII'fVRJ;S REiIICARJIA'fED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EllTA-L EVI L A young Steve Chenault runs a D&D game, circa early 1 980s. This might have even been a session of Hommlet! and tables, the beds in the rooms. This was like nothing I had encountered before. In the Hill Giant Steading, I could see the giant. He was right there. He needed to die. Here in Hommlet, I met with a prosperous farmer and his family: Robert, Mandl, Taior, Matilda, and the granny Florence. This was altogether different. (Those are the names, written in the margi.ns of the first Tl Davis bought and ran me through. We still have it, sitting here on my desk as I write this. ) The Village of Hommlet has a certain elegance to it. Gary Gygax: wrote this short module with a clear adventure story in mind, created a host of NPCs, people, that lived within the confines of the story and were active or inactive participants in it. The story is simple, but the setting is vibrant and seems to exist wholly apart from the characters. Something is going on here that involves all the people of this village and your characters are only one small part of it. In a few short paragraphs, we are introduced to the political regions of central Grey­ hawk, made to understand it is a feudal realm, placed in the rolling-though not peaceful-farmlands of these simple people. It is all very real. Descriptions of goblin raids for food are so simple, yet so electrifying. Tl is so much more than that. It unleashed the DM like few adventures before or really after it. Here were all these people, some with backgrounds, others not so much. They didn't have names (a few did) and were only loosely placed in the larger story. The DM could, if they chose, flesh it all out. It followed a style estab­ lished in Bl: In Search of the Unknown (my second fa­ vorite adventure) where the DM could take the pub­ lished adventure and flesh it out. In that dungeon, the rooms were described and written up, but no monsters or treasures were added. That was up to the DM to do, to go in and make the dungeon their own. Hommlet was very much like that. Gary Gygax: managed, in one simple swoop, to create a setting so vibrant it drew the DM, and by consequence the players, into the village and its story, but at the same time showed the DM a path of creation. The DM could do anything with it. In many ways, Tl was a teaching moment for gam­ ers. I'm not sure if that's how Gary meant it when he 0NGiIIAL ADVEII1'V S REiIICARJIA1'ED • THE TEJtcPLE 0F ELEJtcEllTAL EVIL wrote it, but it's how it played out. It showed DMs and players that you could, if you chose, add all manner of depth to your games. The sky is the limit. It opened up worlds of adventure, like nothing before or after. That's at least how it felt for me. It has something else, too. The art that came with Tl was nothing short of amazing. The opening shot of the village, the keep, and the Moathouse to name a few. All of these grounded the game. Suddenly we were in a world where everything was real. It wasn't just a fan­ tastic place like a Michael Moorcock novel. It was real. And we were in it. We need to take a moment and give credit to the artist of the Moathouse. That simple drawing fueled count­ less imaginations, making the adventure ever more real, grounding it further in a world of sweat and tears. We plunged into Tl and played the living hell out of it. More than once we wandered those dusty streets. And a few years later, when we moved to Heidelberg, Ger­ many, Davis formed his own group and I put together another. Tl was the first adventure I ran them through. Since those early days, I have played Tl countless times, with countless adventuring parties. I change people up, give them different names, different motivations, even the backstory changes. The written module itself is timeless. There was no completed, published Temple in the early days of course (the complete series came out in 1 985), but there was more than enough to go on and Davis, and later myself, fleshed it out wherever we needed. The Temple of Elemental Evil was a part of our Greyhawk long before the actual published mega-adventure hit the stands. Everything you needed was right there, in those opening paragraphs. The world was yours and the Temple an enemy both real and imagined. I don't remember pining for the rest of the adventure. I just assumed this was it and the creators in their lofty towers of Lake Geneva never intended to finish it. But when they did release it, in 1985, and I managed to score a copy of it, it amazed me, for despite all the time that had passed it stood up to the original. Here was the whole grand struggle, unfolding before me and my players. (I never returned to the full Temple with Da­ vis.) The adventure unfolded in multiple levels and was pure Gygax. In later years, when I came to work with Gary (Troll Lord Games was Gary's primary publisher from 2001- 2008) I learned more about him, his gaming, and his writing style. There was a deep sense of historical con­ text infused in the way he saw fantasy worlds and their creation. He, and with him, Frank Mentzer, brought this to The Temple of Elemental Evil, making it one of the most amazing adventure publications created for role-playing games. It has an almost perfect balance to it. There is enough here to flesh out any campaign, but not so much that it bogs the DM down with too much information. You can take the Temple and run with it, fuse it to your world, or play in Greyhawk. As I noted before, there is an elegance to its conception, design, and writing. It's an elegance that makes the first Tl: The Village of Hommlet and later Tl-4: The Temple of Elemental Evil one of the greatest, if not the greatest, published adventure modules in the history of our il­ lustrious hobby.

At that time, TSR staff artist Jef Easley had been with the company for a little over three years. Widely known for his covers of the orange-spined first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons books, countless module covers, un­ forgettable Dragonlance imagery, and so much more, Jef was assigned to work on The Temple of Elemental Evil. Jef would go on to work for TSR from 1982-1997 and continue working for Wizards of the Coast {WotC) until 2003. In this interview, conducted on August 17th, 2020 at his friend Chris Arnesons home, Jef sat down to tell us about his time at TSR, what inspired him, and why hes so amazing. Chris Arneson: Please raise your right hand and state your full name, date of birth, social security number, favorite candy, and how much my monthly payments have been in order to be your friend. Or, just state your name, I guess. Jeff Easley: [Laughs] CA: Make that note: Jeff Easley raised one finger. [Laughs] Okay, it's my understanding that you started at TSR in March of 1 982. How did they manage to pull you away from your previous job at the popcorn factory? Feel free to share a story or two from your time there. JE: The popcorn factory? Well, one story that pops to mind is the time that I'd .just started running the pop­ corn lines in the morning, which sprayed the cheese on the popcorn through a large rotating cylinder. Nobody told me that they would fill the lines up with soapy wa­ ter the night before to keep the pipes cleaned out, and that I had to drain that soapy water out in the morning when I got there. So for a couple days, I was spraying bags of popcorn with soapy water rather than cheese muck. That's the way it goes. You get what you pay for. CA: How did you go from the popcorn factory to TSR? How did they get you over there? Longtime friends Jeff Easley (left) and Chris Arneson (right) af­ ter eating way too much at The Village Squire with good friend Benny Hsieh (not pictured).

I had met Larry Elmore a few years earlier through a good friend of ours, Greg Harper. Greg mentioned to me that Larry had taken a job with TSR. I was pretty desperate to find anything other than the popcorn factory. I knew Larry just well enough to call and ask him about the prospects at TSR. He told me that they were growing by leaps and bounds at that point in 1 982, and I had a really good shot ifl got a portfolio together and sent it in. So I did, and that's what set me on their trail. CA: Was there any negotiating? Or did they call you back, you went in, they liked your portfolio, gave you an offer, and they hired you? JE: Well, they flew me out there. It was not a fun trip. This was in the middle of winter, from Massachusetts to Wisconsin, but they flew me out to look at my stuff and talk to me. They probably made up their mind before­ hand that they were going to offer me the job. I doubt they would have bothered to have flown me in if they were on the fence. They did that, I talked to them, and they made an of­ fer. I would have accepted just about anything at that point. So, yeah, that was what got the ball rolling. 0NGiIIAL ADVEIITVR}OS REiIICARJIATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EllTAL EVIL Chacal-v1 #1, Winter 1976: cover by Jeff Easley Chacaf-vi #2, Spring1976: cover by Jeff Easley CA: You picked up your family and moved, you and your wife? Did you have kids at the time? JE: Just one at the time, but, yeah, we didn't have a huge amount of stuff at that point. We arranged for a mover to come and pick up our stuff. We flew from Massachusetts out to Wisconsin. CA: Did you find a house right away, or did you start in an apartment somewhere? JE: We got a condo over on Main Street in Lake Gene­ va. Several other TSR people lived in the same condo. CA: Nice. Since I've been doing some research about you, I was thrilled to find some older work of yours I'd never seen. Had you done much professional fanzine work prior to TSR? JE: Well, most fanzine work is not actually professional. Most of them don't pay anything, but a few of them did. I had really been into fantasy and that sort of stuff when I was younger, but I got out of it through high school and college, because it wasn't really serious art. About halfway through college, I kind of jumped back into fantasy. I had become disenchanted with the whole college art thing, the studio kind of stuff, and I just real­ ized how much I enjoyed doing the fantasy stuff. So I just jumped back into it. At the time, fanzines were pretty big. I think a lot of them advertised in various magazines like The Monster Times and so forth. I would sometimes send some sam­ ples in, and occasionally, they would use some stuff. CA: You said that was just kind oflike pro bono fanzine work. You were just trying to get your work in there? JE: Some of it was. Some of the nicer ones paid, you know, a little bit like $30 or $40 a page or whatever. CA: While I was looking stuff up, I found a couple that were covers for Chacal. JE: Yeah, it was a nicely done magazine. They actually paid a little bit. I forget what it was for doing a cover. CA: Those are pretty nice. You did some other fanzines like Fantasy Crosswinds and The Diversifier. Now, when I was digging into your stuff, I saw that you had done some work for Marvel's Savage Sword of Conan and Bi­ zarre Adventures? JE: Well, at one point when I was still in college, I managed to make a trip out to New York.

It was the first time I'd ever flown anywhere or anything else, so it was quite an ordeal. I went out there, and he had been working for most of the big companies. I managed to do a couple little pieces for Marvel, a story for one of the Warren Publishing maga­ zines, and a few things like that just to get my foot in the door.

Jumping back to TSR, there's a lot of talk about Gary Gygax having an Appendix N of inspira­ tional reading in the Dungeon Masters Guide. Some of the authors listed were Robert E. Howard, Tolkien, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Did any of these authors inspire or influence you much? JE: I don't think they influenced me, but I basically read some of them, mainly because I bought the books with the Frazetta covers on them and I thought I may as well try them out. I read a few of Edgar Rice Burroughs's Mars books and a few of the Conan books, which were mostly short stories. I read what I could get hold of. CA: Had you read much Tolkien at that time? JE: I remember I read The Hobbit when I was like in the fifth grade. I read The Lord of the Rings when I was in college. CA: Did those inspire you at all? I don't know if you bought those for their covers, because if I remember, the covers on the Tolkien books way back when weren't necessarily anything special. JE: Yeah, I just bought and read them because of the word of mouth and, you know, the buzz. CA: As an artist myself, I'm inspired by the work of other artists. While your work has been a big inspira­ tion to me, what artists were big inspirations for you? Do I dare guess Frazetta? [Laughs] JE: Yeah, he's certainly the main one. I think you're influenced a little bit by everything that you see that you consider to be better than what you could do. I'm always looking to study other people's approaches, how they do leaves or rocks, down to the details like that. 0RjGiilAL ADVEil'fV S REi ilCARJIA'fED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EilTAL EVIL Frazetta ... I don't know to what extent I had that much exposure to some of the more mainstream or illustrator­ type artists. I probably sought them out more after I was in college or afterwards even at a time when I could have been more influenced by them during my more developmental phase. CA: Yeah, back in the Stone Age, there weren't too many places to find this stuff. JE: There was certainly no Internet. CA: Advertisements in the back of comic books? JE: There weren't that many books, really. I think the fantasy art book craze actually started with the Frazetta books back in the mid-1970s. And then all of a sud­ den, everybody was having books, magazines, and more well-produced material come out. CA: I assume you're familiar with Hal Foster and Alex Raymond, some of the comic strip masters. Were you familiar with them as a kid or in college? JE: I remember probably one of the first examples of Frazetta's work that I saw were the early Warren maga­ zines, like Creepy and Eerie. At that point, Al William­ son was actually doing work for them. He's one of the EC Comics alumni that had come up and was working for Warren at the time. So I was aware of his work. Honestly, I felt like it was just so far beyond my ability I didn't even consider that I could emulate it or aspire to it, you know? CA: What about Hal Foster? Did he do Prince Valiant? JE: Yeah, well, he did Tarzan early on and Prince Val­ iant. He had kind of a big revival in the 1970s, too. There was kind of, like I say, a renaissance of fantasy art and old comic art and so forth. I had never been exposed to it, maybe it was around before then, but I started buying this Comics Buyer's Guide. Everybody advertised in that kind of book, and reprints of all that stuff were coming out then. So it was almost a little bit too late for me to be totally influenced by it. I could certainly admire it and aspire to it to some degree. CA: You started at TSR in March of 1982. Do you re­ member what your first assignment was? Somewhere along the lines of the jewels on the spines of the Endless Quest books, maybe? JE: Yeah, that was it. I literally went there, and I was standing there my first day with my coat still on, and • • Jeff's amazing full-page image of Drelnza from one of h is earli- est assignments at TSR, 54: The Lost Caverns ofTsojocanth. • • they handed me this thing. "We need these jewels done for the spines. Larry has been doing these covers for this Endless Quest book series." I thought, "Well, all right. Whatever you need." So it was the first thing I did after I took my coat off. I sat down and painted some jewels for a few of the Endless Quest book covers. CA: If you recall, did they have paints and everything set up for you? Or did you have to bring in your own? JE: I think I might have brought my own paint with me, because I had it there anyway. Eventually, they probably had me put in an order and replaced it, but I still have some of the paint. There was a lady at Murray [State University in Kentucky- Editor] who had taken an oil painting class and didn't like it, I guess, so she gave me all her paint. [Laughs] I probably still have half that paint up there in my studio. CA: Along the lines of your beginning work, I've heard you talk about the AD&D module The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth as your first big assignment. Were you excited to work on it? 0RjGiirn.L ADVEITTV S REiITCAR_IlATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EllTAL EVIL JE: Well, I didn't know anything about it. It was just like, "This is what you're gonna do." I can't remember if I did the Tsojcanth illustrations before I did the painting for the Star Frontiers module cover. I thought I did the painting first, but I could be wrong. CA: It sounds like you hadn't played a game at the time. Did you understand what the game modules were essentially like or anything? Did they just give you, "Here's a description of a scene," and then you did the illustration for it? I'm speaking of Tsojcanth. JE: Yeah, I had no idea what this game stuff was, so they just told me what they wanted in the illustration. Most of them were little quarter-page spots anyway. And I wasn't familiar with a lot of the monsters and so forth, so I had to sit there and rely on the Monster Manual or whatever reference I could find to see if they had been drawn before. They told me what they wanted, and I put it down there. CA: One of your illustrations that really stands out to everybody is your amazing image of Drelnza, the sleep­ ing warrior vampire. Did the art description inspire you more on that one or did you just have more time? That one really stands out. It's a nice big full-page piece. JE: Well, that's the thing. It was the only full-page piece in there, so I thought, "Well, I can put a little bit more into this one." Nobody was on my back for deadlines or anything, so I just thought, "I'll do this one up." CA: Nice. Well done, amazing piece. JE: Thanks. CA: You covered it a bit already, but how long was it before you got to do your first cover painting, and what was it? JE: For the Star Frontiers game, it was the one with the squid guy on the dinosaur thing. I forget the names of them. [ Volturnus, Planet of Mystery.] CA: I do know what you're talking about. I might have seen the original. JE: It was around for a good while. CA: It's a neat piece. Were you excited to do that first cover piece for them? JE: Yeah. When I took the job at TSR, I didn't know if I was going to be doing any covers or not. I thought maybe I was just going to be doing black and whites. I • • Jeff's first cover painting for TSR. As the woman's red suit was deemed too provocative Jeff painted a glaze of blue over it to ap­ pease the powers that be and the cleaning lady. • • mean, I was working at a popcorn factory. I would have moved over there to empty the trash cans if they'd asked me. [Laughs] So I was a little surprised when I found out that everybody else is actually doing covers also. So fine. CA: Was there something about the woman's figure, or her suit, that you had to change? JE: Yes, I originally had painted her with a red jumpsuit which was vaguely form-fitting. It was kind of a typical 1950s- or 1960s-style space girl suit-but it was red. They brought in one of the ladies who cleaned the office and had her critique it for me. [Laughs] They asked her if she would let her son buy this module, and I think she was swayed more than anything by the fact that they asked her if she thought it was fishy or not, and she said, "Oh, no, I wouldn't let my son buy this." I was not trying to be provocative at all. Typically, in fantasy art, both male and female figures are idealized. You don't paint, you know, your dumpy neighbors or use them as the models in your fantasy art. So anyway, the 0RjGiilAL ADVEilTVR,!:S REincAŕIlATED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEllTAL EVIL compromise that was reached was that I'd glaze the suit over with blue to turn it purple. I guess purple was less inflammatory to young adolescent eyes than they figured red was. That was enough to get it by. I didn't change the figure at all. I just altered the color of the suit. CA: Really, just the color of the suit. That's interesting. JE: Stupid is what it is. CA: [Laughs] That, too. I don't remember if I heard that part of the story, but that's cool. They actually asked-nothing against cleaning ladies-but they just pulled someone aside. I guess it makes sense, "Would you let your kid buy this?" Since we're talking about the covers, how long did TSR generally give you to do a cover? Did you have plenty of time in most cases? JE: When I did the first Dragonlance calendar, they gave us all the time we needed, because they were going to reuse the art for the modules. I guess the schedule was such that it was not pressing. I might have taken a month on a painting like that. But the worst thing I can remember was when I did those little Amazing Stories paperbacks. For some reason, I think I had to do four of those in a week or something like that. CA: Holy cow! JE: I don't think it was even a week. I was going to say three days, but that doesn't sound right. Maybe it was three covers in four days, because they wanted this airbrushed background. I was not familiar with an air­ brush, so it took me an entire day to figure out how to do the airbrushed backgrounds. Then, I think I did the covers, like, one a day. CA: You've become very well known for your amazing dragons. I've noticed a major shift between your early dragons, like for the cover of the orange-spined AD&D Monster Manual, as compared to your much more mus­ cular and menacing dragons for Dragonlance. Had you drawn any dragons before TSR, and what was your first dragon you drew for them, if you recall? JE: Well, the only drawing of a dragon I ever recall hav­ ing done before TSR was for the aforementioned Cha­ cal magazine. I did a portfolio with five or six pen and inks from The Hobbit, and one of those was Smaug at­ tacking the city. So that was the first time I ever did a dragon. • • Some ofJeff's earliest TSR dragons, before they evolved into the amazing, muscularly menacing beasts he's so well known for. • • For TSR, I suspect the first time I drew a dragon was for the Tsojcanth interiors. There are a couple dragons in there, so those are my first attempts. CA: The other black and white one I remember was, I guess, for an early Gen Con advertisement with a num­ ber of PCs battling a dragon in pen and ink, one of your earlier ones. It was also, ifl recall, printed on the inside of the French version of the B/X basic set. 0NGiirn.L A.DVEIITVRJ:S REiIICAR._IIA'fED • THE TEJlIPLE 0F ELEJlIEfiTA.L EVIL How did you go from drawing your first dragons to switching to the more muscular, more menacing type of dragon? Did they somehow come out that way or did Dragonlance describe them more menacingly? JE: I'm not 100% sure. I think that it was kind of a natural evolution. At one point, I realized that a lot of times it almost seems like human anatomy on the up­ per arms and so forth, and the body of a dragon. Of course, you can't really do that on the legs. I don't know where I picked that up. Thinking about it, I remember that I had this science fiction book club book that Boris [Vallejo] did the cover for called The Dragon and the George. It seemed like Boris does kind of the same thing with human-like hands and arms and stuff on dragons. Of course, he was very big at the time, up-and-coming; he was the next big star after Frazetta kind of retired, to some degree. Maybe I kind of picked up on that from the Dragon and the George painting. I can't say for sure. I certainly want to give credit where credit's due, if there's credit. CA: It seemed like your earlier ones, even the Monster Manual cover with the dragon fighting the pegasi, were more fairytale-ish, more regular, and then these just took a leap 0£ .. JE: Well, I think I tend to do one thing. When I do a flying dragon, I do them leaner and more aerodynamic than I do a dragon on the ground. When they hit the • • One of Jeff's favorite dragon paintings done for The New Easy to Master Dungeons & Dragons Came boxed starter set, 1991. • • ground, they kind of explode. Of course, they're magic, so take what you will. But, yeah, they get a little bit more "bull­ dog" when they hit the ground there for whatever reason. That just looks neat. CA: Do you have a favorite dragon painting that you've done? Any one that maybe comes to mind that you really were pretty extra pleased with how the dragon turned out? JE: Well, the big red dragon painting on the [199 1] begin­ ner's box set. I know I had to do that kind of quickly. I think I did that in 10 days, which is kind of quick. It was a 30" x 40" painting, and I was kind of under pres­ sure to get that done. Luckily, it landed correctly right where I wanted it. I was pleased with it from the start, and the company was very pleased with it, too. So that worked out. CA: Are there any particular paintings or projects that stand out as favorites in general? Anything you look back on like, ''Ah, I really liked that project or that painting," or maybe it's just that red dragon you were talking about. JE: Well, that's one of them. A lot of times you look back on paintings you've done before and, like any art­ ist has done, look at the piece with fresh eyes and just immediately see a list of things you would correct or would have done differently if you had the chance. But that's one I probably don't have too much of a com­ plaint about. And the cover for The Magister, you know, I liked the way that one came out. Most of them I don't know the names or have names for them, so it's a little hard to name them off, but there's a handful of them in there. Probably 80% of the paint­ ings I did, I would never have done, otherwise. Unless they were a cover or described as they were, I would not have painted them anyway. 0RjGiIIAL A.DVEIITVRJ;S REiIICARJIATED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEllTA.L EVI L CA: Talking about Dragonlance, was that a really cool project to do with their descriptions? You said you had a little more time to work on them? JE: They'd done calendars for the few years before that. The year before, they had Tim Hildebrandt do it, and he was, you know, one of the super big names at the time. Unfortunately, he's no longer with us, but they had him do the paintings. When we got the chance to do the paintings and the cover of the calendar the next year, we were all like, "Okay, we got to really step up our game here if we're going to have a chance of com­ peting with the Tim Hildebrandt stuff." We put every­ thing we had into it, you know. We were psyched. We were young and dumb and full of ambition. CA: Other than dragons, you're also well known for your undead skeletons, like the Magister cover for the Forgot­ ten Realms product line. Did you always love drawing undead, and did you have any inspiration for them? JE: I was always intrigued by skulls and skeletons and the like. Even when I was a little kid, like at Hallow­ een, I'd always gravitate towards skeletons. I remember, when I was very young, my dad bought a plaster skull from a guy. It was, like, an anatomical model. It was a cast plaster skull on a base that students in the 1940s probably would have set up and drawn from. My dad gave me that, and it was just the greatest thing I ever had. It was my favorite thing at the time. At one point, I remember carrying it somewhere, and it just slipped out of my hands. I dropped it, and it smashed into a million pieces. I picked up all the little pieces, intending to try and glue it all back together. Of course, it was impossible. That was devastating. When I first got back into fantasy art, I started picking up some of the Warren magazines and stuff again, and only then did I come across Bernie Wrightson's work. That was right up his alley, so I'm sure I saw some of his work that was probably something of a direct influ­ ence. I can't really think of that many people who had a direct influence on me, but I suspect that might have been one of them. CA: And Ray Harryhausen obviously had his famous skeletons. JE: Thar's true. Yeah, I loved that movie, "Jason and the Argonauts." At least, it showed on TV back in the early 1960s, and I would not miss that. FR4: The Magister for AD&D's Forgotten Realms is a prime exam­ ple of)eff's incredible talent for bringing the undead to life. A little-known fun fact is that the door-size poster of this artwork can be seen in Kenny's room in the 1991 movie "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead." • • CA: Now, his were always just clean bone skeletons, but you added all kinds of rotting flesh and torn, old, rotting clothes. JE: Well, the decayed body thing is the Wrightson in­ fluence or part of it right there, you know. And, Har­ ryhausen, too-I think I'm correct that, oftentimes, he would kind of furrow the brows on skulls so they'd have a scary scowl on their face. It's normal, if you have a skull. Usually, it's laughing or smiling with no flesh on it, but he would actually furrow the brow so ... CA: . . .  so that they can show emotion. JE: A skull with a scowl. [Laughs] CA: I know you paint in oils, and I've heard a story about you baking a painting once to try and help it dry faster. Is there a fun story or truth to this rumor? 0NGiIIAL A.DVEIITV S REiIICARJIATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EllTA.L EVIL • • While freelancing the cover painting for Monogram's Rambo Combat Chopper model kit, Jeff decided to use a painter's trick for drying oils by putting it in the oven. Needless to say, there was a mishap and Jeff's painting bubbled. Fortunately, he was able to salvage it. • • JE: Interestingly enough, before I even did this, I'd read that Bernie Wrightson had done that one time. He put a painting in the oven and left it too long, and it bub­ bled up. So I was aware of the phenomenon even then, you know. I was doing a painting for another company. It was a Sunday, and I was going to bake it dry and do some more tweaks. At that time, I think I had to ship it. There was no scanning or anything like that. I put it in the oven, and it stuck out of the oven, and I had it on a metal rack. I guess the heat came up under the edge of the rack and concentrated right on a corner, because it had a bubble like five inches tall on it. So I spent the whole rest of that afternoon running around trying to fig­ ure out how to deflate the bubble and save it. I ended up having to cut around it, put glue under it, mash it down, and roll it and everything else. So, yep, guilty. CA: Were you able to salvage it and send it off on time? JE: Yep. CA: Nice. That actually happened to me one time, too. Actually, rather than preheating the oven and then put­ ting it in there, I was in a rush because I was going to go to lunch with my dad. I turned the oven on before he got there, and I put the painting in right away. So I had the quick heat instead of it already preheated. Just before we went to lunch, I pulled it out, and there were bubbles all over. Needless to say, I had to start that all over, and I went digitally with it because of time. But, yeah, that kind of happened to me, too. Since this interview is being included in 1he Temple of Elemental Evil from Goodman Games and you have done a fair amount of work in it, I've got to ask you why all your illustrations and some others are signed "Jack Fred," "J Fred," "Jack F," or "JF?" I know you and Larry have told the story many times, but please tell us the tale about dear old Jack Fred. JE: That was something Larry had come up with. I think they used to do this at Fort Knox. He used to tell his kids stories when they were little about a character Jack Fred or something like that. At one point, I think he was doing a job that he had to really rush out and couldn't do a very good job on it, so he signed it "Jack Fred." He told us the story at some point or another. On oc­ casion, we had to crank out something really quickly to get it out the door. So I guess we used Jack Fred's persona as a cover. I don't think it worked very well, but it is kind of a funny thing. CA: A number of these Temple illustrations are signed "Jack Fred." They're not bad, though. Was it just maybe a fun thing or a little bit of, ''Ah, this just doesn't seem very good" in some cases? JE: The ones I think that you're talking about, they didn't seem that bad. I don't know if we just decided, "Okay, maybe we all have to contribute to the thing or something. So let's do 'Jack Fred' on this one." I guess if you're going along even a fast drawing can sometimes be a good one. You don't have to heap huge amounts of time on it. I guess a few of them, you know, just slipped through the cracks. [Laughs] CA: Now, what did Larry have in the book? I found one of his drawings in there, but I didn't see it signed at all, either as "Jack Fred" or "Larry Elmore." There were a number of yours, and they were signed "Jack Fred" or "JF." I found other one that I think might have been Jeff Butler's; it was a real simplified, orb-shaped skull. I think that might have been Jeff Butler's, because he's listed in the credits and I couldn't find anything else that might have been his. Otherwise, you're the main perpetrator. Keith Parkin­ son had one image in there, a full-page storage area, that he signed "Jack Fred." I don't know if it was a "just because" or if he was like, "It's just a storage area; there's nothing fun or exciting about it," or you guys were just going along with something. 0NGi ilAL .A.DVEil'f'VR]:S REiilCARJIA'f'ED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EilT.A.L EVIL .

If you examine the illustrations in the original TSR publication ofThe Temple of Elemental Evil, you'll see that virtually every illustration in the book is signed "Jack Fred" or a variation on that name-even though the module's credits clearly list several famous artists as contributors. Based on con- versations with Jeff and our own best guesses, here are what we believe to be the true credits for these illustrations. Of course, we might be wrong-if any TSR alumni can provide documen- tation, we welcome it!

I don't think Clyde ever participated in the Jack Fred phenomenon, did he? JE: He might not have. We didn't do it very often, may­ be just two or three times that I can recall. Don't get me wrong. He might not have gone along with it, I don't know. [Laughs] Clyde usually refused to turn anything out half-baked. CA: Clyde could be particular. He put out extraordi­ nary work as well. I know that oftentimes artists don't actually play the games they create art for. However, I have heard a story of you playing D&D briefly in your early days of TSR. JE: Yeah, early on, several of us had never played the game before, so we decided, well, we should kind of get our toe wet on this. At the time, Jim Roslof was there. He was well versed in the game, so we started doing a D&D campaign at lunchtime. We all rolled up characters. I was Some of Jeff's artwork for The Temple of Elemental Evil.

I was lucky enough to roll up a pseu­ dodragon familiar, which was highly coveted by some of the rest of the group. [Laughs] After about a year or so-I had been playing for a while-I think I finally reached 6th level, and I ac­ quired my fireball spell. So I was itching to use that sucker, you know. At one point, we were in a situation where it seemed like a good idea. I think Jim had left as DM, and Keith Parkinson had taken over DMing. So Keith said, "Are you sure? Did you read the instruc­ tions and the parameters and so forth?" I said, "Yeah, I'm going to throw the fireball." And he kept ... [Laughs] He almost begged me not to throw that fireball, but I threw it anyway. Yeah, it pretty much fried everybody, and since I was an elf, I couldn't be resurrected or some­ thing like that. So I really fried myself I think I also fried my pseudodragon and everything else. Yeah, that was a miscalculation. We limped along for a little while after that, but it wasn't quite the same. CA: Do you remember who was playing in that campaign? JE: Larry and Keith. I can't remember if Tim Truman was there at the time. I think Clyde was actually play­ ing, too. Keith was DMing. I can't remember . . .  Maybe Steve Sullivan. There have been so many people who have come and gone during my tenure there that it's In this image of a grimoire for page 83 of Unearthed Arcana, Jeff, with his great capacity for wit and humor, decided to hide a few fun messages such as "Help me," "Send me money," "Give me a break," etc. • • hard for me to remember where they overlap. CA: Having known you for years, I know you have a great wit and sense of humor. I also know that art­ ists sometimes like to sneak little Easter eggs into their work. I recently had one brought to my attention that is on page 83 of the Unearthed Arcana book where you illustrated an open grimoire. Amongst the gibberish type, you snuck in some phrases such as "Help me," "Send me money," etc. Just what were you thinking, and can you think of any other times you snuck in an Easter egg or a hidden meaning or reference? JE: Well, I just thought it'd be fun to do that to break up the gibberish type, as you put it. I remember one time, actually, in one of my Warren stories. My aforementioned friend, Greg Harper, was a big comic book fan. At the time I was inking this comic book work, there was a jungle scene or something like that, so like down in the underbrush, I put, "Hi, Greg,'' and alerted him after it was published to look for it. [Laughs] He got a kick out of that, I think. I would do that every now and then if something crossed my mind. One main thing I remember is the time I :was supposed to do some kind of a black pudding, or some­ thing like that. I forget what it was. It was just kind of an amorphous blob shape. So I did a silhouette of Bull­ winkle the Moose upside down and used that for the character drawing. I didn't think anybody would spot it until three or four of the designers trooped down and confronted me with it. They got a kick out of it, I think. CA: Did it make it to print? JE: Yeah, I think it did. CA: Nice. JE: Unless your name is Hanna or Barbera, then it did not get to print, of course. CA: Since this is a Goodman Games book, I must point out that you've done some great, fun work for them, too. I have a couple of favorite pieces in mind. Do you have a favorite or two that you did for Goodman? JE: I'm not sure if I can remember everything I did. Probably, one of my favorites that I can remember is the trap illustration [in The Dungeon Alphabet]. It's a skel­ eton reaching out and picking up a gold coin with a lit­ tle chain. As he was pulling, he set off the trap, and he's impaled on a couple of dozen spikes. Obviously, this happened some time ago, because he's a skeleton now.

I didn't have to sit there and think about it. Ir's what immediately popped into my head for "trap." CA: That's nice when an idea just pops into your head. That's a great perspective on that illustration, too. It's kind of from the perspective of the coin on the floor, almost. JE: Yeah. Luckily, sometimes something like that pops in your head and by the time you draw it, you've totally changed it or missed the impact that you had in your head. But with that one, the perspective, angle, and eve­ rything was right on. I was pleased with that one. CA: Yeah, it's one of my favorites. Most people know you as a pretty good fantasy artist, but they may not know what an incredible sculptor you are. I've seen many amazing sculpts by you over the years. I under­ stand that you sculpted the Andy Gump statue in Flat Iron Park in Lake Geneva. You also sculpted a life-size Verminaard helmet for the Dragonlance board game and an alien skull for the back of the Dark Sun box. Did you do much other sculpting for TSR or anywhere else over the years, and do you have any information on the ones I listed? JE: When I was growing up, I enjoyed modeling with typical Plasticine modeling clay. I did probably just as much sculpting as I did drawing. Building stuff was a part of it-something I always enjoyed doing. I just have never really had any reason to do it, which is why I don't do it very often. Of course, there's no foreshorten­ ing or anything like that, but sculpting has its own set of problems and solutions, different than drawing. CA: Your Andy Gump sculpture is still standing in Lake Geneva? JE: Yeah, luckily, he was not a Confederate soldier or anything. So, yeah, he's still up there for now. One rea­ son I had to do it was that it was originally sculpted, I think, back in the 1920s and presented to [Sidney Smith,] the fellow who drew Andy Gump. But, yeah, it was just a plaster statue he donated to Lake Geneva. They put it up, and it basically dissolved in the weather. So they had it redone numerous times over the years. Of course, you get up into the 1960s and so forth, and people were starting to vandalize it. When I got involved, someone had actually stolen the whole statue, so there was nothing there. A fellow had started a base, but he passed away before he got to finish it. Somehow, they got my name. I'm not sure how I was associated with it, but I figured I could do it, you know. I just had to get like 350 pounds of oil-based modeling clay, which took forever to unwrap one pound at a time. I did about 90% of it. I was kind of dragging my feet, because I did it for nothing. I didn't feel too pressed to get it done. [Laughs] The city brought in another fel­ low, Jerry Sawyer, who's a sculptor. He put his hand in. He tightened up some of the sculpting, but I did about 90% of it. And he was, like, the model maker. He did the mold for it. They sent it up to a place in Wiscon­ sin which did miniature golf-type statues and stuff, and they cast it in fiberglass. That's how that got done. CA: To go back to your Verminaard helmet and Dark Sun box alien, how did it come about that you got to do those? JE: That was just in-house. I forget who I did it for. Roy Parker might have been involved in one or two, maybe both of them, but whoever contacted me or asked me 0NGiITAL ADVEilTV S REiITCAR._IlATED • THE TEDIPLE 0F ELEDIEllTAL EVIL While most people know Jeff for h is amazing paintings, they may not know he's an incredible scul ptor as wel l.

So I said, "Yeah, I'll do it." The helmet was just made out of plaster, and the skull was plaster and Sculpey. It was fun to do, but I basically did it in-house. CA: You used to do a lot of sculpting in sets for the local YMCA, ifl'm not mistaken. JE: The YMCA, I used to help them out. They'd have a dinner every year. It was always a themed fundraiser. One year, they did "The Wizard of Oz." So I sculpted or built a witch's hourglass for them to use up on the podium. We did the backgrounds; we did a big wizard head, machinery, some Styrofoam Emerald City towers, and all this kind of stuff. It was always a lot of fun to do. At one point, the Fire Department was doing a haunted house every year, so I got involved in that. For four or five years, I did something for them. I did a full-size Tyrannosaurus head one year, and then a crashed space­ ship, and several things like that. It was always fun to do. CA: I saw a set you were working on once.

I did do a lot of tombstones for them one year. I built an ''Alien" suit and, like, an ''Alien" corridor with machinery and stuff in it. CA: You like building with your hands and sculpting, and you're incredibly talented in that aspect, not just painting. I just thought it'd be neat to share. JE: Well, I enjoy doing it. It's certainly a change of pace from all the painting. CA: You worked on staff at TSR from 1 982 until it was bought by Wizards of the Coast back in 1997? JE: Well, yeah, but I continued on with WotC until about 2003. I think I made it just over the 20-year mark when they pretty much let everybody go. CA: Well, tell us a little or a lot about your time there, some favorite memories with other artists, or the game. JE: The whole 20 years in general or just with WotC? CA: Your whole time there, if you've got any fun sto­ ries or your favorite memories with other guys working there. I've heard stories where it sounds like you guys had a lot of fun. JE: One story that comes to mind and has been told before happened early on at Gen Con when I think it was still held over at Parkside, the college, in Wiscon­ sin. TSR was going through kind of a tight spell with money, and they didn't want to pay for our hotel rooms to stay at Gen Con. So I think it was me, Clyde, Larry, and Keith. I believe Larry had borrowed a big tent from a neighbor, and we set it up in the Jellystone Camp­ ground near Parkside there. We camped out in a tent on the nights we were at Gen Con that year. One night, I think Larry ran us all out with his snor­ ing. Clyde and I went home, and when we got back the next morning, Keith was sleeping in the truck. He couldn't stand to sleep in the tent when Larry was snor­ ing. [Laughs] That's an old one. CA: Any other interesting stories from your time at TSR? Any fun in the art room? JE: Well, another story that we've told numerous times is about the dart games we used to get up to there. Larry had done this at Fort Knox, again. I think Larry is the only one who had ever worked for any length of time in an art department, so he had a lot of traditions that he carried through. We got a dartboard and started throwing darts at lunch­ time. None of us were very good, but some had gotten better quicker, you know. We all went over to the local store that actually sold darts, and we each got our own darts, custom flights, that kind of stuff. It was fun to do that. We would knock off a little early on weekdays, about 4:30, and we'd start a few games of darts before we left. One day, we were sitting there throwing darts. Behind us, there was a little window that went into the produc­ tion room. One of us turned around and noticed that Lorraine Williams, the head of the company, was stand­ ing there watching us throw darts. [Laughs] So we just kind of froze there, and then baby-stepped our way back to our chairs. Nothing was ever said about it, but we were all a little caught with our hands in the cookie jar. CA: Your deadlines didn't get shorter after that? [Laughs] JE: They were probably short enough. CA: I seem to recall a story about a rubber band fight that was had while you were out of the room. I'm sure there were ones you participated in. ezjGiIIAL A.DVEIITV S REiIICAR!IATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EilTA.L EVIL • • Clyde Caldwell, Larry Elmore (kneeling), Jeff Easley, and Keith Parkinson pose for one of TSR's calendars. Jeff is seen in his "goofy" set of cardboard armor. • • JE: That must have been the one where they skipped a rubber band across my wet painting, and somebody sat there and doodled with it to fix it. I didn't know it hap­ pened until somebody told me about it later. I heard about it later, but I don't think I ever noticed it. CA: Fun stuff. JE: At one point, we made blowguns. You take an alu­ minum arrow shaft, cut off the ends, and then use that as the tube. We would get those upholstery needles with those little balls on the end. I don't even know what the needles are for, but you can stick them in the arrow shaft to make great blowgun darts. So we were shooting blowgun darts at the dartboard. At one point, I found out that one of the other artists I won't name skipped a blowgun dart off the floor and stuck it in one of my paintings. I think even to this day there's a little blowgun dart hole in one of my paintings. CA: While you were at TSR, did you get to meet or work with any other high-profile celebrity artists that you were a fan of or whose work you admired? JE: For a pretty good stretch there, we had guest artists at Gen Con. We had a number of people who we ad­ mired, thought we could get, and so forth like the afore­ mentioned Tim Hildebrandt. Who all did we have? At one point, it had kind of left our hands; the Gen Con people themselves were inviting the artists. We had Mi­ chael Whelan. That was a big one, and a comic artist, Mike Grell. Steve Hickman, he was a really nice guy. I think we actually got Boris there one year. CA: Do you remember how that came about? JE: Well, since you want to hear the story . . .  [Laughs] I think they'd been in contact with Boris, and they had [Gerald] Brom. So Brom got tagged to be, like, the li­ aison between Boris and Gen Con or, at the very least, he was the one who was supposed to contact Boris and talk to him and see if he could convince him to come to Gen Con. Anyway, Boris was supposed to call Brom, I guess. Let's see if I can get this right. Brom was kind of on pins and needles at the prospect of talking to Boris to negotiate with him. I went down and talked to Diesel [Laforce], and said, "Why don't you call upstairs and impersonate Boris?" [Laughs] CA: So it was your idea! JE: Yeah, yeah. So he went, "Oh, okay." A half an hour later, the phone rings. "Brom, Boris is on the phone!" Brom's eyes got big, and he sat down. Then, he talked to him for, you know, 20 minutes, negotiating hotels and everything else. He got off the phone. "Everything's all set up." I expected Diesel to let him in on the prank while they were on the phone rather than afterwards. Well, Die­ sel comes upstairs and says to Brom, "Was that Boris on the phone?" Brom answered, "Yeah." "What was he asking?" "This, this, and this." "Did he ask you this?" "Yeah." Somehow or another Diesel managed to relay the infor­ mation that it was him impersonating Boris. I thought it might have been funnier if he'd just said something like, "Where do you want to go for lunch? I'll be right up," or something like that. But it was funny. [Laughs] CA: Nice. I know Diesel can expound on that since he made the phone call. He has been talking about every­ thing he told Brom, all the requirements that "Boris" wanted in order to get him to go to Gen Con. That's pretty funny. 0NGiITAL ADVEilTVJU;S REiITCAR._IlATED • THE TElhPLE 0F ELElhEllTAL EVIL Do you have any favorite memories of living in Lake Geneva? I know a lot of the fans of TSR and Gen Con just love Lake Geneva and the area. JE: Well, it was a really nice place to live, but, of course, during the summer, it's so crowded, and I'd avoid it. I'd avoid downtown like the plague. But, yeah, it's a beauti­ ful lake and so forth. At this point, the main attraction as far as I'm concerned is actually Gary Con, which is a convention they have every year. Gary Gygax's children started it up after his death. It's grown in popularity and scope every year. Unfortunately, this year was canceled, but hopefully, they'll be back next year. It's something I always look forward to. CA: Did the TSR gang have any favorite meet-ups, hangouts, or favorite restaurants in town that you fre­ quented? JE: Su Wings here in town is a Chinese restaurant. It's been here longer than I have, so that was always a popu­ lar TSR lunchtime destination. Also, we went to the Next Door Pub fairly often; it's right where the old TSR building was, right across the highway. And, if you go out the back door of the old building and go across the lot, there used to be a Pick 'n Save. That's what we usu­ ally had for lunch. We'd walk over there, get some stuff from the deli, and bring it back to sit and eat there in the break room. CA: Exciting. [Laughs] How long was Next Door Pub there? Has that been around since you guys were there? JE: Yeah, that's been there as long as I can remember. CA: I can only imagine how fun Halloween parties with a bunch of talented artists like yourselves would have been. Would you care to share any Halloween party sto­ ries, or talk about costumes you made over the years? JE: [Laughs] I was a lot more energetic back in the day than I am now. Occasionally, I would get inspired to do something. At one point, when I first got there, they'd have a Halloween parade. People came in costume, almost like in grade school. They'd line up and walk around the building and stuff, you know, so people could see your costumes. The first year I was there, I'd only been there a few months, but others had said people occasionally do stuff for Halloween. I was living in an apartment with basi­ cally no supplies, but I had some cardboard and scissors and stuff. So I cut out and pieced together a hatchet painted with some acrylic paintings that I happened to have on site. And I made a little piece on there that I think I actually glued to my head. I brought that into work the next day and put it on in the bathroom, you know. I didn't have any proper makeup stuff so I actually glued it to my head with Elmer's glue. I also didn't have any kind of blood stuff, but in the cupboard I found a package of strawberry Jell-0. I mixed the strawberry Jell-0 up into a slurry and kind of piled that around where it was going in. It was dripping down my face. So, yeah, it was something of a hit. We artists were still over in the old hotel, and Jim Roslof decided that I needed to go over to the office, with this thing on my head, and have a drawing approved in person. He just wanted me to go over to the main building. Somebody drove me over there to get an approval on my drawing with an axe in my head. Another year, I built a big Transformers suit out of card­ board boxes. I don't even have photos of these things. I think I had one photo of it, and I did something with it. I think I actually have a photo somewhere with the axe in my head, too. I did the "Alien" chest-burster one year, too. CA: Wasn't there a picture of you guys where you're wearing the Transformers costume or a knight's helmet? JE: One year, I just made this big goofy set of armor out of cardboard and construction paper. We had man­ nequins and stuff in the art department, and I just had this big, old, oversized helmet sitting up in my cabinet there. At one point, they wanted us to dress up for a picture on the back of the calendar. Some of the guys had ar­ mor and swords and stuff. Well, I just put on my big goofy-looking cardboard helmet, just for the back of this cover. It looked pretty ridiculous. I had a big axe and stuff. It was fun. CA: Do you have any fun stories about Halloween par­ ties with these guys? JE: Well, Diesel got to the point where he would throw a Halloween party every year. I think he and Dawn Murin kind of collaborated on it toward the end. It was always a lot of fun. CA: Did any of the artists ever dress up like other artists at Halloween parties? 0NGiilAL ADVEilTVRJ:S REiilCAR._IlATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EilTAL EVIL JE: Oh, I know what you're look­ ing for. [Laughs] One year, Brom decided he was going to dress up as me. He borrowed some of my clothes and stuff and, like, a bald wig and so forth. [Laughs] To be honest, I didn't realize it was supposed to be me un­ til somebody told me. "Yeah, funny." Thar was funny. I wish I'd known so I could have had retaliation in mind before he went. CA: Before I get you into too much trouble with all these questions and without getting too teary-eyed, can you sum up your time, friendships, experiencə, and ɚelinɛ about your ɞɟɠɡɢɣɤɥɦɧɨɩɪɫɬ• time at TSR? Thar's a big one. One of Jeff's largest and most revered pieces is the 4' x 6' painting "Siege of Lord Eyrie's Crag," commissioned for a private col lector. JE: ɜll, I certɝnly met a lot of peo-؁؂؃؄؅؆؇؈؉؊؋،؍؎• ple at TSR by way of just working at TSR. I worked with a lot of people. I was there for 20 years. I don't think anybody else was in the art depart­ ment that long. A lot of people came, a lot of people went, you know, and I still have contact with many to some degree and certainly consider them friends. It was certainly one of the best times of my life, you know. I never enjoyed going into work more than I did then. CA: So it was probably a good experience getting to work there. There were no other environments really like that, were there? Ar FASA, maybe? JE: Well, that's true. I don't know of any other ... Of course, I don't know about all of them, but there are certainly no art departments now where everybody sits there and works traditionally, non-digitally, all day eve­ ry day. We certainly fed off one another, you know. Of course, we were all young and ambitious . . . CA: You weren't ruined by the world. JE: Yeah, that was later. But, yeah, it was a friendly competition. We all wanted to shine in the group so we all tried and usually put forth our best effort. Some­ times, it just didn't happen, but for the most part, it was very inspirational, very motivational. CA: Well, as an artist, some people have a magnum opus, their last hurrah. Have you done your magnum opus yet? Do you have a peak to end on? JE: Well, as far as a painting, you always like to think you've got the best one left in you, you know. Hopefully it's not going to be totally downhill from here. Like I say, there are a handful of my favorite paintings. I did one as a commission years ago. It was a 4' x 6' paint­ ing, which is one of the largest ones I've ever done. The "Siege of Lord Eyrie's Crag" painting. That was proba­ bly one of the most impressive paintings I've ever done. • • Jeff's only album cover was done for the Italian symphonic pow- er metal band Rhapsody of Fire . • 0RjGi ilAL ADVEilTV'S REiilCAR.._IlATED • THE TEJl:PLE 0F ELElhEilTAL EVIL CA: That was actually just sup­ posed to be a commission, not particularly for TSR, but they did buy the rights later? JE: Yeah, I did it for a commission, but, yeah, I did sell them certain rights. They used it several times, maybe a DM screen and, at least, one Dragon magazine cover. CA: Have you done many heavy metal album covers? JE: If you mean that. .. CA: Rhapsody of Fire? JE: Correct, Rhapsody of Fire. CA: What would the 10-year-old you be thinking of the work you've done? You've been published in all kinds of books and magazines, done covers ... JE: Well, I certainly had long stretches of time when I thought that would never happen. At one point right out of college, I was all ready to start taking classes in TV re­ pair, get a trailer in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and make the best of it. But, luckily, one way or the other, the fates intervened and pulled me into the wilds of Wisconsin. Yeah, I guess, were they German? ·•-------• CA: I was going to say it's never too late, but I don't think anyone does TV repair anymore, so maybe it is Italian, Italian.

Nothing else ever came of it, but it was fun to do the one. CA: Anything else on your artistic bucket list that you desperately need to do? JE: If I were left to my own devices, I would probably build stuff, at least for a while. I spent so many years just painting, and I do have an interest in building and sculpting stuff. If it were for enjoyment, I would prob­ ably lean into something like that before I got back into painting again, unless something came up that I really felt like I had to do. JE: Yeah, I know. [Laughs] CA: All right. Well, thanks a lot for your interview, in­ sight, and wisdom, Jeff. JE: Sure! Okay. Chris Arneson grew up in Wisconsin just 30 short minutes from TSR, though it wasn't until attending college at UW­ Whitewater that the close proximity sank in. By that time, he had long since fallen in love with Dungeons & Dragons and its art. He was hooked after getting the Ero! Otus Basic box set and the Endless Quest book Dungeon of Dread. The Art of the Dragonlance Saga put Chris on his path of trying to become a fantasy artist. Since Chris was local he was incredibly lucky to hook up with game designers Jim Ward, Lester Smith, and Tim Brown after TSR closed to do some freelance art for their company, Fast Forward Entertainment. Soon after, Chris did work for the Legend of the Five Rings, Wheel of Time, and Rifts CC Gs, among others. Currently Chris is relishing in the work he gets to do for Joseph Goodman of Goodman Games. You can find his illustrations in this very book! 0RJGiIIAL ADVEIITV'S REiIICARJIATED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEilTAL EVIL CHAPTER TWO T1 -4: The Temple of Elemental Evil Original Publication T 1: 1he Village of Hommlet was first published in 1979, with a monochrome cover. The second and third printings also featured a monochrome cov­ er, with the only changes depicted on the covers. The fourth printing occurred in 198 1  and featured full art on the cover and back with a light green cover, along with the new TSR logo. The fourth through seventh printings were virtually the same, although the map on the last page was inverted from the sixth to the seventh printings. The sequel, T2, was hinted at, but was delayed six years! It was finally released as the supermodule Tl-4: 1he Temple of Elemental Evil. Rumor has it the mod­ ule codes WG 1 and WG2 were set aside for 1he Village of Hommlet and 1he Temple of Elemental Evil but were never used. Tl-4: 1he Temple of Elemental Evil had seven printings, a testament to its popularity. Some editions were even reprinted years following the release of the second edi­ tion of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons in 1989. The first printing was August 1985 (as listed on the tide page). The second printing corrected some of the textu­ al errors in the book. The third through fifth printings were very similar except for minor changes to the cov­ ers. The fourth printing was in 1987. The sixth (1991) and seventh (1992) printings featured the updated gold TSR logo. Interestingly, three of the popular supermodules were edited to form a single epic campaign arc. T1-4 was designed to lead into Al-4: Scourge of the Slavelords and then into GDQJ-7: Queen of the Spiders. The content of Al-4 was revised slightly to suit 7th- to 1 1th-level characters to bridge the gap between the other two. Information of these printings was summarized from The Acaeum, an online site for D&D collectors. For more information, visit www.acaeum.com. CORRECTIONS TO ORIGINAL TEXT When converting a classic late '70s or early '80s module into the latest Original Adventures Reincarnated book, we often uncover minor mistakes, missed edits, and in­ consistencies. This was certainly true for both OAR #3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks and OAR #4: 1he Lost City. But in converting Tl-4: 1he Temple of Elemental Evil, we discovered many of these "oddities," so our crack editor Tim started a list to track them all, includ­ ing how we resolved them (or not). Although these in­ consistencies lend to the charm and mystique of such a classic book, over the years it has led to frustration, especially to those Dungeon Masters interested in run­ ning this module for the next generation of gamer. How does this occur in such a beloved book which is considered a legacy in the storied history of Dungeons & Dragons? We postulate several reasons. Back in the late '70s, TSR did not have access to modern comput­ ers and software such as Word and Excel with handy features like Find and Replace, Track Changes, spelling and grammar checks, etc. Don't underestimate the lack of a spreadsheet to track and manage all the moving parts of such a massive product. And it was massive; clocking in at 128 pages, it is considered one of the first mega-dungeons and was called a "supermodule." Fur­ ther, Tl: 1he Village of Hommlet was released in 1979, while Tl-4 did not come along until 1985, SIX years later. Urban legend has it that Gary Gygax turned over his extensive notes on the dungeons below the Tem­ ple to Frank Mentzer to organize and further develop. Anyone who has worked on a project team knows how that goes. The credits page lists FIVE editors on the manuscript. Invariably, mistakes were going to creep in with that many "designers and editors in the dungeon." Did we catch all of them? Probably not, but our goal was to make the adventure and the story as approacha- 0JtjGiIIAL ADVEII1'V'S REiIICAR.._IIA1'ED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEIITAL EVIL ble as possible, without taking a heavy-handed approach to re-writes. What follows is a list of many of the incon­ sistencies we uncovered, what we did about them, and sometimes the "why." In area I 13 of the Inn of the Welcome Wench in Hommlet, "Furnok's funds consist of a small hoard of 37 gems worth 50 gp each (three bloodstones, eight car­ nelians, four chalcedon, four citrines, six onyx, and nine zircons), and 12 sp and 12 gp for gambling." That is only 34 gems, so we adjusted it accordingly. The map of the Guard Tower in Hommlet had several issues, particularly areas G 10 to G 12. First, the label for area G 10 is on the wrong floor; it should be on the parapet level in the large space with the ''A" markings surrounding areas GS and G9. Areas G 1 1  and G 12 were labeled G 10 and G 1 1 , respectively; thus, G 12 wasn't on the map but was described in the text. These are now correctly labeled, and we added "S" markings for the two scorpions on the roof (area G 12). In the Moathouse Dungeons, we had a few minor issues. Area 26A was not labeled; instead there were two area 26s on the map. In area 27, the bugbears know that La­ reth is "to the north" but his quarters are clearly south of the bugbears' location. And finally, the area 34 descrip­ tion says there is an extra room in the northeast corner, but that should be the southwest corner. All these issues were addressed. One thing we did not change was Lar­ eth's deity. The text states he serves Lolth, but the Spi­ der Queen is not mentioned anywhere in the Temple of Elemental Evil. This does seem to be inconsistent, with Zuggtmoy or Iuz being his likely deity as they are the main players at the Temple. It's possible Lareth was an agent for the Spider Queen, there to monitor her ene­ mies, so we kept it as originally written. [Author's Note: This was how the character was treated in the official novelization (The Temple of Elemental Evil by Thomas M. Reid, 2001), which I was quite fond of. - Chris.] In the Interlude: Hommlet to Nulb section, there were several different distances described in various parts in the module and they did not all align with the overland map. We settled on "about a two days' journey afoot" for this in our chapter 6 and adjusted our new overland map accordingly. The material that became chapter 8 had a few parts that needed to be adjusted. The Exterior Notes section says, "The thrown down works and razed buildings are shown on the map by X marks." Yet, there aren't any "X" marks on the map. We didn't bother fixing this and just elimi­ nated the "by X marks" phrase, assuming the DM can fig­ ure it out on their own. Regarding the Broken Tower, the escape tunnel "bears generally west" but the map shows it exiting the tower to the northeast. For this conversion, we altered the text and added a sharp curve in the tunnel's path, in a separate map. We also fully detailed the aban­ doned farmhouse and the well where the escape tunnel exits. The description of the Upper Temple says it is 450 feet across at its widest point but if you look at the map you can see the structure is only 360 feet wide (12 squares at 30 feet per square). Area 10 of the Upper Temple had a few issues. First, the original states the throne sinks to area 352, but really it sinks to area 340. It also re­ fers to the Orb of Golden Death as the Orb of Elemental Death. This is confusing in part because this artifact has many names, including the Yellowskull, the Goldenskull, and the Death Orb. These four names are all used inter­ changeably, but Orb of Elemental Death is not one of the names. This was an easy fix, but for continuity to the original, we kept all the other names intact. There was no need for a fifth name. It also states the Orb's location is area 322 but that should be area 338. Confused yet? Just imagine if you were a teen-aged DM in 1986 trying to figure all this out! Although Dungeon Level 1 didn't have any glaring inconsistencies, the same can't be stated for Dungeon Level 2. In area 209, we have a few minor descriptions snafus. First, the doors are described as brass, but later room descriptions describe them as bronze. We went with bronze, as it seemed more consistent in other doors throughout. Second, the descriptions of the pictured priests are incorrect. The original refers to "a square on a figure wearing silvery gray robes" and "a circle on a green-robed cleric." The elemental symbols should be a circle on the silvery gray robes and a square on the green robes. We'll be honest, area 210 is a mess. The original de­ scription says the stairs in area 145 descend to here but in reality, they ascend to the ground level; the stairs in area 148 are the ones that actually descend to area 210. The overall room description is hard to understand as written, so after lengthy debate, we made some deci­ sions. We decided the "great pierced square of bronze" is the point from where the alarm emanates. We're not 0RjGiIIAL ADVEII'f'VRJ;S REiIICAR._IIA'f'ED • THE TEll:PLE 0F ELEll:EIITAL EVIL sure what that pierced square is supposed to be, as the correct symbol for the Air Temple is a circle. There is a circle on the map but that could possibly be depicting the shaft in the ceiling up to area 131. Which is not properly aligned, by the way. (Count the squares-we did!) This misalignment was discovered late in the lay­ out process, so we did not alter the maps as that would have distorted the Dungeon Level 2 map. And, we still are not clear what or where the dome is in this room. Two more minor things regarding area 210, which were easily addressed. The original text said items placed in the pit are teleported to area 526 in the Air Node, but the Air Node was never fully developed and did not use that numbering system. For OAR #6, we changed the destination to be area 1 in the Air Node. Area 21 Oa mentions the drelb as being a new monster in an ap­ pendix, but it isn't described fully in the appendix or anywhere else in the book, so we decided to convert the entry in the AD&D Monster Manual II. We had a few more confusing Air Symbol issues on Dungeon Level 2. In area 223, the bugbears aligned with the Air Temple have gray cloaks adorned with "a large black square." We changed that to a circle, as that is the symbol for the Air Temple. Area 225 has an Air Temple robe that is "worked with crystal beads and jet to form black squares with shining centers." Again, to match the Air Symbol, we switched the shapes to circles. Dungeon Level 3 wasn't too bad. Area 307 mentions a "branched staff" described in area 427, but that area describes no such item. Perhaps that should have been area 417? (A reference to Hedrack's room, and his mace of smiting?) For OAR #6, we changed it to where the leucrotta won't attack anyone obviously attached to the Greater Temple or carrying a black scarab. In area 334, Prince Thrommel is a paladin but his unique sword Fragarach is listed as a sentient chaotic good sword, which is unusual since paladins in AD&D were traditionally lawful good. After going back and forth, for OAR we made Thrommel and Fragarach both lawful good despite paladins not being restricted to that alignment in fifth edition. In area 353b a niche appears to be in the south wall according to the map. However, the text indicates the niche is in the west wall. That was an easy fix. Regarding Zuggtmoy's imprisonment on Dungeon Lev­ el 3, there were several contradictions. These include: • Area 339: "Now, however, the demoness is prevented from entering this hall until all four of the sealed por­ tals are broken." • Area 340: "Zuggtmoy cannot enter this Audience Hall unless three gates have been sundered: the Grand Entrance (above ground, area 1), Earth Temple (area 145), and Octagonal Chamber (210)." • Area 353: "If the lowest gate (340) is sundered, Zug­ gtmoy is no longer imprisoned in area 353 (A and B), but is freed to roam the entire north dungeon (areas 339-353)." We felt the need to clarify and simplify this to "If the lowest gate (see area 340) is sundered, Zuggtmoy is no longer imprisoned in areas 353a and 353b, and is free to roam the entire north dungeon (areas 339 through 353)." Most of the confusing issues we discovered on Dun­ geon Level 4 were directly related to the maps. For ex­ ample, several fireplaces mentioned in the text were not present on the map (areas 414, 41 5, and 417). In area 419, the discussion on the "Ceremonial Activity" seems to be backwards. It said the creatures summoned from the Plane of Fire emerge in area 427, but that area has a gate to the Fire Node, not the Plane of Fire. It then goes on to say they proceed to area 426, but that's just a hallway. We presume the original intent was for them to proceed to area 427, which has the gate to the Fire Node. Area 428 says it is identical to "area 428," when this obviously should refer to area 427. The text in area 434 refers the DM to read area 429's description if the pillar is touched, but the pillar section is actually in area 435. Similarly, area 435 refers back to the Great Hall at area 364 but the Great Hall is actually area 353. The Nodes in the original module were not fully devel­ oped, so there were few errors here. In the Introduc­ tion section, it says each gate in the dungeon can send "up to eight human-sized beings," but the actual gate descriptions say 10. We went with 10 and switched it to Medium-sized creatures to align with modern con­ ventions. The Transportation section refers back to area 35 1 (twice!) but that area doesn't have a portal or gate. We fixed that to refer to area 339 in both instances. In the Water Node, there was a mix-up with the compass direction descriptions of a few of the seas. Area 5 was labeled "Northwest sea," but it is in the northeast car- 0RJGiIIAL ADVEIITV'S REiIICAR_IIATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EIITAL EVIL Name.; Ko'bor -\- _C Jװ ױײ hj,ʓJ.ʔl._._r,__r _ _ _ _ _ S+ ,.

This misguided NPC appeared in the original T7: The Village of Hamm/et (area 114), along with a nefarious monk. They clashed against our heroes, but after defeating the monk, the outnumbered fighter surrendered. For a half share of treasure (and XP), he joined the party for their assault on the Ruined Moathouse, and eventually the Temple of Elemental Evil (until we got bored with the encounters). He stayed with the party as a loyal henchman for years, going up against the Slave Lords and eventually Against the Giants! Even though he now wields a vorpal longsword, he still carries his signature battleaxe! Despite gaining only half XP (+10%!), we worked him up to 9th level (no small feat in i E  D&D) before retiringthe character. Kebort would later become the inspiration for Lord Koborth in OCC#57: Castle Whiterock. '4 ... > J:l.l '4 Ǒ t: J:l.l s J:l.l '4 J:l.l ࢲ 0 J:l.l '4 j:l., s J:l.l ...

No, and if anything, it even adds to the charm of the original work and its storied path to get to publication. In the perfect world, Mr. Gygax would have had the time to focus on the manuscript, meeting its original publication date, but the pressures of running a successful company booming in a fledgling industry conspired to delay the project several times. The solution was to bring Mr. Mentzer into the fold to push this supermodule across the finish line. Based on the history of what happened to Mr. Gygax and TSR a few weeks following its publication, we should be thankful the original design team made this a priority for the fans. Otherwise, the tale might have ended in the Moathouse Dungeons. • • Chris Doyle & Tim Wadzinski tt / llllJCD / HHltll l IUHl- __ ,. ....... ʠ TAB LE O F  C O NTENTS - SECTION O N E :  T H E  VI L LAGE O F  H OM M LET - ORIGINAL PRINTING (WITH MONOCHROME COVER) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  46 FULL Co LOR COVER . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  72 - SECTION TWO : THE TEM PLE OF ELEMENTAL EVI L  - ORIGINAL PRINTING . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  78 0NGiilAL ADVEil'fV'S REi ilCARJIA'fED • THE TElhPLE 0F ELElhEllTAL EVI L IBlllCEB BUIGIGIS l BBIGGIS] Dungeon Module T1 The Village of Hommlet by Gary Gygax INTRODUCTORY TO NOVICE llVEL The Village of Hommlet has grown up around a crossroads in a woodland.

The village (actually hamlet-sized, though local parlance distinguishes It with the term "village") Is located some 10 or so leagues southeast of the town ofVerbobonc, on the fringe of the territory controlled by its noble Lord, the Viscount ofVerbobonc. It is at a crossroads. To the north is the mighty Velverdyva River, along whose south bank runs the Lowroad. Many days' travel to the east, on the shores of the Lake of Unknown Depths (Nyr Dyv) is the great walled city of Dyvers, the village of Sobanwych about halfway along the route. Below that to the southeast and east are miles and miles of forest, the Gnar1ey, beyond which is the Wlld Coast, Woolly Bay, and the Sea of Gearnat. The road south forks a league or so beyond the little community, one meandering olf towards the Wlld Coast, the other rolling through the lower Kron Hills to the village of Ostverk and then eventually turning southwards again Into the elven Kingdom of Celene. The western route leads into the very heart of the gnomish highlands, passing through Greenway Valley about a day's travel distant and going onwards to the Lortmil Mountains far beyond. Hommlet grew from a farm or two, a rest house. and a smithy. The roads brought a sufficient number of travellers and merchant wagons to attract tradesmen and artisans to serve those passing through. The rest house became a thriving inn, a wheel and wain­ wright settled in the thorp, and more farmers and herdsmen followed, for grain was needed for the passing animals, and meat was in demand for the lnnfolk. Prosperity was great, for the lord of the district was mild and taxed but little. Trade was good, and the land was untroubled by war or outlaws or ravaging beasts. The area was too free, too beautiful, too bountiful, at least in the eyes of some. Whether the evil came west from Dyvers as Is claimed by one faction, or crept up out of the forestlands bordering the Wlld Coast as others assert, come It did. At first it was only a few thieves and an odd group of bandits molesting the merchant caravans. Then came small bands of humanolds-kobolds or gobllns­ raidlng the flocks and herds. Local militia and foresters of the Waldgraf of Ostverk apprarently checked, but not stopped, the spread of outlawry and evil. A collection of hovels and their slovenly inhabitants formed the nucleus for the troubles which were to Increase. A wicked cleric established a small chapel at this point. The folk of Hommlet tended to ignore Nulb, even though It was but six miles distant. The out-of-the-way position was ideal for the fel purposes planned for this settlement, as was its position on a small river flowing into the Velverdyva. The thickets and marshes around Nulb became the lair and hiding place for bondits, brigands, and all sorts of evil men and monsters alike. The chapel grew Into a stone temple as its faithful brought in their ill-gotten tithes. Good folk were robbed, pillaged, enslaved, or worse. In but three years a grim and foreboding fortress surrounded the evil place, and swarms of creatures worshipped and worked their wickedness there. The servants of the Temple of Elemental Evil made Hommlet and the lands for leagues around a mockery of freedom and beauty. Commerce ceased, crops withered, pestilence was abroad. But the leaders of this cancer were full of hubris, and in their overweening pride sought to overthrow the good realms to the north who were coming to the rescue of the land being crushed under the tyranny wrought by the evil temple. A great botle was fought to the east, and when villagers saw streams of ochre-robed men and humanoids fleeing south and west through their community, there was great rejoicing, for they knew that the murderous oppressors had ben defeated and driven from the field In panic and rout. So great was the slaughter. so complete the victory of good, that the waited stronghold of the Temple of Elemental Evil fell within a fortnight, despite the aid of a terrible demon. The place was ruined and seated against a further return of such abominations 2 by powerful blessings and magic. life quickly returned to a semblance of what It had ben before the rise of the temple, and in the decade since, the village and surrounding countryside have In fact become more rich and prosperous than ever before. A monstrous troll which plagued the place for a time was hunted down by a body of passing adventurers. With its ashes, these fellows returned a goodly fortune as well. leaving a portion With the villagers to repay them for their losses before going elsewhere to seek their fortunes. Other adventurers, knowing of the evil that had once resided In the area, came to seek out similar caches, and not a few did locate remote lairs and find wealth-just as some never returned at all. Afler some five years, adventurers stopped coming to the area, as it seemed that no monsters were left to slay, no evil existed here to be stamped out. For four years thereafter, this seemed true, but then bondits began to ride the roads again-not frequently, but to some efect. This seemed all too familiar somehow to the good folk of Hommtet, so they sent word to the Viscount that wicked forces might still lurk there abouts. This Information has been spread throughout the countryside, and the news has attracted outsiders to the village once again. Who and what these men are, no one can be quite sure. although all claim to be bent on slaying monsters and bringing peace and security to Hommlet, for deeds speak more loudly than words, and lies cloak true purposes of the malevolent. Start: Your party is now approaching the Village of Hommlet. having ridden up from lands of the Wlld Coast. You are poorty mounted, badly equipped, and have no large sums of cash. In fact, all you have is what you wear and what you ride, plus the few coins that are hidden in purses and pockets. What you do possess in quantity, though, Is daring and a desire to become wealthy and famous. Thus your group comes to Hommletto learn if this is indeed a place for adventurers to seek their fortunes. You all hope, of course. to gain riches and make names for yourselves. What the outcome of this will be is uncertain, but your skill and daring, along with a good measure of luck. will be the main ingredients of what follows, be It for weal or woe. The small community at the crossroads is a completely unknown quantity. What is there, who will be encountered, where to go? These are your first explorations and encounters, so chance may dictate as much as Intelligence does. Wlll outsiders be shunned? Are reports of the whole community engaging in evil practices true? Are the folk here bumpkins, easily duped? Does a curse lay upon those who dare to venture into the lands which were once the Temple's? All of these questions will soon be answered. The dusty, rutted road is lined with closely-grown hedges of brambles and shrubs. Here and there it cuts through a copse or crosses a rivulet. To either hand forest and meadow have given way to field and orchard. A small herd of kine graze nearby, and a distant hill is dotted with the white of a flock of sheep. Ahead are thatched roofs and stone chimneys with thin plumes of blue smoke rising from them. A road angles west Into the hill country there, and to either side of the road ahead are barns and bulldings-Hommlet at lastt The adventure begins . . . Notes for the Dungeon Master only This module is designed for beginning play. This is not to say that experienced players can not play and enjoy the scenario, but they should start new, 1st level, characters to do so. If you happen to have a group which is quite new to the game, there is no sense in requiring that they begin the whole thing over once more. Experienced 1st, 2nd, and even 3rd level characters can begin in Hommlet. You must modify the material in the START portion, of course, and It Is a good idea to sharply limit the amount of material they can bring to the village, as you will understand when you read the KEY to the place. If your group of players has had exceptional luck, simply engineer a minor encounter or two along the way-leprechauns, a thief, or perhaps some brigands. Each numbered building area has Its general information flrst. Immediately following this Is material which you should not reveal to the players. As a matter of course throughout this module, all insertlonal material which is for your information is in bold face or enclosed by parentheses. As you read aloud, skip those sections. Of course, if you are so thoroughly familiar with the module that you can simply glance at the number key and then put 0RjGiIIAL ADVEIITV'S REi IICARJIATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EllTAL EVIL everything in your own words, so much the better. You should be conņersant with the whole before beginning play, and your players will reflect the degree of skill you have in presenting the material herein dramatically, as if it were your own. In fact, the whole is only general, and while some characteristics of the non-player characters (hereafter referred to as NPCs) are given, there is sumclent latitude for you to completely personalize the module to lit your style of play and satisfy your players. Follow the guidelines given, but round them out so as to make each encounter unique. The persons met at the inn, along the road, and so forth, are you; for the Dungeon Master is all-monsters, NPCs, the gods, everything. Play it to the hilt. Do it with nair and wit. Be fair both to the characters and to yourself. Be deceitful, clever, and thoroughly dishonest when acting the part of a thief. Be cunning but just when in the role of o wording ranger. Actually think of it as if the part you ore toking is that of o chorocteryou ore playing, and act accordingly, but temper actions with disinterest in the eventual outcome and only from the viewpoint of that particular role. Wearing two, three, or o half dozen or more different hots is challenging, but that is port of being on outstanding OM. The area here, os well os that of the Temple (contained in o separate module), was developed In order to smoothly integrate players with and without experience in the Greyhowk Campaign into o scenario related to the "old timers" only by relative proximity. All hod new characters, although the experienced players were assigned characters with levels above 1 st or 2nd. The whole attempt turned out quite well, and many of the NPCs In the module ore the characters and henchmen developed through play. The situation and the surroundings have been altered because of the actual experiences of these participants, although the "clock" hos ben turned bock to give you and your group of players on opportunity to make "history" on your own. While I om strongly tempted to relate the events ofthe campaign we played, I believe that it is inappropriate to the module­ perhops sometime in on article in THE DRAGON . . . Only certain of the villagers ore no med. Please norre the others to suit your campaign. Similorty, most of the buildings do not have noor plans, so you should do them for any of these where you pion action. Change the mop of Hommlet os the game progresses. Note any places which ore destroyed, odd new ones for any persons you have moved into the place. If o general bottle seems likely, you con list the village militia and fight it out on the tabletop. In short, the scenario hos ben left os open as possible for indMduolization. Have fun! As o final note, remember that the NPCs who ore given os agents of various powers will send o continual stream of Information to their superiors. They wil be cautious in all that they do and unlikely to be duped or maneuvered. If they participate In any adven­ tures, or if they ore imprisoned or badly treated, their "masters" will be very unhappy upon hearing the bod news, and each concerned party will absolutely seek to redress matters according to their alignment. personality, and ultimate goals. There ore wheels within wheels in Hommlet and the lands around, and behind each character there is another, the circles growing wider and the figures shadowy but very powerful. 3 KEY TO THE "UAGE OF HOMMLET 1 .  PROSPEROUS FARM COITAGE AND LARGE BARN: The wood and plaster house is well-kept, and the born beyond is bulging with hay, groin, etc. Several lot animals ore about. A large goodwife, rosy-cheeked and friendly, greets all who coll, while four children look on. Inside o young girl and on old granny do various chores. Two large formdogs (AC 7; HD 1 +1 , HP; 7, 5; 1 attack for 1-4 h.p. damage) bark loudly ot the approach of strangers. The head of the house and two full­ grown sons work in the fields. There is nothing to interest adventurers here, and outside of feed groin or hay, the former does not have anything to sell or trade. The three men are mlllla, 0 level; the elder has a blll-gulsarme and a ring mall Jack, whlle his sons have leather armor and shield and wield a ftall and a batle axe respectively. Each has a dagger at all times. HP: 6, 5, 4. They take arms only In seH· defense or when called up by the village elder. The farmer has 5 7 p.p. hidden In his matress and a 500 g.p. gem secured In his pouch against hard times. The lintel over the front dor Is carved with acorns and oak leaves, and If politely asked, they will state that they are of druldlcal persuasion. 2. MODEST FARMHOUSE AND BARN: Clean but slightly rundown buildings indicate that this form is not too prosperous. How­ ever, the stock around looks quite healthy and plump. An elderty couple ore master and mistress, while on active lad of 1 2  or so, o servant, does chores. There is nothing of particular interest to be seen, and these folks have nothing to trade. They say that their son Elmo would be interested in talking with strangers - he's at the inn having a jock of ale. Their other son, Otis, they go on sadly shaking their heads, took service with some gentlemen and is away seeking his fortune. Elmo is strong, but not too quick, and he is overfond of brew . . .  The elderly farmer Is a retired tighter (515, 112, W16, D12, C16, Ch1 1) still equal to 4th level; HP: 16. He has a suit of scale mall and shield, sword and crossbow In a chest In the front rom. He Is captain of the mlllla, but he will say nothing of It. Underneath some rusty nalls In a keg In the back shed are 20 p.p., 51 g.p., and 1 72 e.p. A cupboard In the house holds a silver service worth 1,300 g.p. Elmo Is a 4th level ranger (5 18/43, 1 15, W 16, D 16, C 1 7, Ch 11); 5HD, 41 hit points. He has the following Items hidden In a lead-lined oaken chest burled In the dirt floor of the barn: +1 chain mall, +2 shield, +1 batleaxe, 6 100 g.p. gems, 10 p.p., 50 g.p. and 100 s.p. He carries a +2 dagger at all times. ("My brudder Olis gave It to me!" he will proclaim proudly If asked.) Elmo's speech Is slow and halting. He often appears tipsy and jovial, but he Is not. Elmo Is an agent of the Viscount of Verbobonc, and he frequents the Welcome Wench Inn In order to observe all newcomers and Insinuate hlmseH In their expeditions; thus Elmo will be Interested In getting MONEY!? (to be used for later ale purchases obviously) for being a man-at.arms, and he will gladly go with any who ask providing they will fumlsh him with armor and a "BIG axe". If so employed, he will wear his own mall In 0NGi ilAL ADVEilTVRJ:S REiilCAR._IlATED • THE TEDIPLE 0F ELEJb:EilTAL EVIL place of, or under, that purchased and use his magic axe as well. If anything untoward befalls Elmo, his brother Olis will eventualtv hear of It and seek redress. Olis ls a 10th level ranger away on a quest with Y'dey, the Canones of the local church, and an elven accomplice named Murftes, a fighter/thief of 1st/2nd level. (For further Information see THE TEMPI.! OF El!MENTAL ML) 3. COTIAGE: This rustic abode houses the local woodcutter (0 level mllltlaman, leather armor, battleaxe, crossbow; 6 hit points), his wife, and 3 young children. He has nothing of interest to adventurers and Is not Interested In adventuring. He Is of druldlcal rellglon, and he reports anything unusual fo the Druid of the Grove (24., below). In a pouch under the floorboards of his cotage are 9 g.p., 13 e.p., 1 7  s.p., and 38 c.p. 4. WELL-KEPT FARM: The house and barn show that this farmer Is doing well, and the stock In the fenced-In yard are very fine­ looklng. A widow and her two grown sons (0 level militiamen, leather armor, spears, hand axe, club; 4 hit points each), their wives, and 8 children dwell here. They are Interested In neither trade nor adventuring. As are most tolks In the village, these people are followers of druidism. The two sons have a large Iron pof burled beneath the tre In the back yard; It holds 97 g.p. and 421 s.p. 5. PROSPEROUS FARMHOUSE: This farmer Is a widower (0 level militiaman, leather armor, shield, sword; 3 hit points) of middle age, with 5 children, the eldest being two daughters, and a manservant laborer (0 level militiaman, no armor, voulge, club; 6 hit points). He is the brother of the farmer to the south (1 ., above). and quite distant and taciturn. He turns folks away unless they have farm business. Inside a crock in the manure plle are hidden 3 50 g.p. gems, 37 p.p., and 55 g.p. He carries 8 p.p., 15 g.p., 22 s.p. and 8 coppers In his purse. 6. HOUSE WITH LEATHER HIDE TACKED TO THE FRONT DOOR: This Is the home and business of the village leatherworker (0 level militiaman, leather armor, shield, sling, hand axe; 4 hit points). With him live his wite, her brother (a simpleton who does not bear arms). and 3 children of whom the eldest Is a 1 2  year old boy (0 level militiaman, leather jack, buckler, sling, dagger; 2 hit points). The leather-worker is a jack·of-all­ trades. being shoe and bootmaker, cobbler, saddler, harnessmoker, and even fashioning leather garments and armor, the latter requiring some time and a number of fitings and bolling. He is not Interested in any sort of adventuring. Sewn Info an old horse collar are 27 g.p. and 40 e.p. as well as a silver necklace worth 400 g.p. 7. LARGE WALLED BUILDING WITH A SQUARE WOODEN SIGN SHOWING A BUXOM AND SMILING GIRL HOLDING A FLAGON OF BEER: This is the Inn of the Welcome Wench, a place renowned for Its good food and excellent drink. Passing merchants make a point of stopping, as do many other sorts of wayfarers, and the place is always filled with patrons.

(The place is covered on a separate map as is the inn). Both traders clalm disinterest In all allgnmenls, pro· claiming that they happlfVdeal with anyone who Is a paying customer.

Naturally, they are desirous of having their agent accompany the party. If the group does not hire their agent, the traders will keep close track of their activities by any means possible, Including following them personal­ ly If the situation wanants It, I.e. If they know that the party has ben particularly succesful. For such mlutons the stock of magical devices hidden away will be brought out. The traders will gladly buy any items which the adventurers happen upon, they say, and pay a fair price for such tool The sum paid for any Item In good condlHon Is 40% to 70% of setting price stated In the bok, just as they sell at 110% of bok value, minimum price, asking more first. 14.

MODEST COTTAGE: Three dogs (AC 7, HD 1 +1, 7, 5, and 4 hit points, 1 attack for 1-4 hit points damage) guard the home and flock of Black Jay, a grizzled herdsman (2nd level fighter -S 1 7, 1 1 3, W 1 2, D 15, C 1 1 ,  Ch 1 0-HP: 1 1 ;  chalnmall and shield, longbow and 1 O +1 arrows, sword and dagger, elven cloak and bots) who does not like company or strangers and says so to any who come onto his property.

CUTHBERT: This newly built edifice was raised by the Viscount In honor of the aid rendered to him by the Archclerlc ofVeluna In the war against the Temple of Elemen­ tal Evil. A somewhat distant cleric and his assistant omclate during services and otherwise serve their flock. In general, anyone coming to the church In other times wlil have to deal with the lesser cleric, the Priest, Calmert (3rd level-S 8, 1 1 0, W 1 6, D 15, C 9, Ch 1 1 -HP: 1 4; plate mall and shield, +1 mace; all spells typical are listed hereaner), for holy water can be 0NGiIIAL ADVEIITV'S REiIICA.RJIATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EllTAL EVIL obtained only at this location or from the trader (who purveys plain water as holy water . . .  ). Calmert is known for his zeal in obtaining contributions. (This honest man Is anxious to give a sum to the builders of the fortress under construction, and although it should seem otherwise, most of the miscellan­ eous money he collects for "the church" from characters will go towards building the castle!) The Canon Terjon (6th level cleric-$ 1 1 ,  1 1 0, W 16, D 12, C 16, Ch 8-chain mail, shield +1 , mace; 41 hit points; lnvlslblllty and mammal control rings; typical spells noted hereafter) recently became the chief cleric of the church, taking over from the Canoness Y'dey who left unexpectedly and has not returned. The villagers say that Terjon is not particularly friendly and his sternness is a cause of some speculation. Actually, this cleric Is not a bad fellow at all, but he Is rather displeased at being called to care tor the church white Y'dey Is on a quest, tor Terjon Is desirous of being off adven­ turing himself, and ONLY the request of the Archcleric of Veluna keeps him on station. Detailed Information of the 6th level cleric, Y'dey, Is given In ADVANCED DUNGEONS Ir DRAGONS MODULE T2, THE TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL ML For more Information on the church, see the appended key and floorplan.

COTTAGE AND LARGE BARN: These well-kept buildings are obviously those of a cowherd. and a particular odor Is quite noticeable in the area.

This family Is part of the congregation of st. Cuthbert. They have a sack with 42 s.p. and 189 c.p. under the floor of the cheese storage shed. 22. MILL AND ATTACHED HOME: Here dwell Mytch (0 level militia­ man, scale mail, shield, spear, sword; 4 hit points), his wife, 3 children, and 2 servants (one of whom is a O level militiaman, leather armor, longbow, battleaxe; 5 hit points).

They are not particularly successful at farming, but they are excellent fishers, trappers, and hunters. The villagers are not particularly fond of these folks. The spinster daughter Is only In her twenties, and Is handsome but bosy. These people do not follow any religious persuasion, so they are excluded from most village functions. They have saved 73 s.p. In a hollow of the tre to the north. 6 24. THE GROVE: This Is obviously a place of worship. The trees are neatly pruned, and the grass Is well-tended. A carefully placed line of bluish stones sets off the path leading to a rock cairn where flowers, nuts, berries. and garlands of leaves are placed. A small path leads beyond the shrine to a low-roofed wooden building placed under the great boughs of the central oaks of the copse. A call will bring forth the druid Jaroo Ashstaff (7th level druid-$ 1 1 .  I 1 1 ,  W 18. D 9, C 1 5, Ch 15-HP: 44; padded armor, cloak of protection +2, staf of the snake, +1 scimitar, ring of lnvlslblllty; spells given below). All comers to the Grove are expected to make offering-then and there, and the druid wlll so state. If the visitors are not druidical, they are expected to give several gold pieces to Jaroo as donations towards the needy of Hommlet. The druid will listen to requests for assistance from those who contribute. Jaro Is an agent of the Druids of Gnartey Wood, sent to Hommlet to se If the Temple of Elemental Evil Is totally destroyed, and to help repres any rise of evl ot,thls sort. He will give aid by spells but nof accompany a'1>arty. If the group Is a suspicious one, Jaro will follow at a ȵstanc;e to se what goes on.

The herdsman has managed to save only 9 g.p. and 33 c.p. which he stored away In a small woden box hidden In the rafters of the upper main rom. He and the Druid of the Grove are good friends. 26. BARN-LIKE HOUSE WITH A WHEEL NAILED TO A POST: This is the residence and shop of the local wheel and wainwright. The main part of the structure Is a barn where he builds and repairs carts and wagons.

DOUBLE FIELDSTONE WALLS FILLED WITH EARTH: Here are the beginnings of a smallish castle, being built around a new tower atop the low mound. Workers have dug deep trench lines about 1 O' wide and as deep, down to a hard clay, and It con be seen that they ore In the process of mortaring the foundations of the wall which they wlll build above. Work hos barely begun, but the outlines of bastions, towers, a gatehouse and a keep can be noted. The keep is atop the second hillock, and considerable excavation hos token place, the earth from this digging going to use in the walls around the whole. Some dressed stone blocks are visible, evidently having ben carted in from elsewhere, as they are not similar to local stone. The whole ls being financed bythe Viscount and the Archcleric ofVeluna, tor favors done bythe owners of the tower, (31.), which they built as well. The maglo-user and fighter will, In retum, H1Ve the Viscount by holding the area safe for him and reporting on any unloward hapenings. 31. TWO-STORIED TOWER: This structure Is some 55' high, a smaller tower rising inside the greater at about 35' above the ground.

Natural tree trunk pillars support the ceillng overhead, all dark with smoke and age. From 4-16 customers will be In the place, and these will be travellers of various sorts-merchants, tinkers, and peddlers-and local folk in an even mix. In the evening, there will always be more people, so double the number rolled. in addition to the normal patrons, there will be a 50'1. chance thatthe NPCs who hove chambers above (Upper Floor: 1 ., 5., 8., and 9., hereafter) will be in the common room.

PRIVATE ROOM: This chamber Is for visiting noblemen, rich merchants, and so forth. It has a long table and comfortable side choirs. Those wishing to hove a private meal use this place. It Is nicely furnished and has tapestries and paintings on the walls. 3. PRIVATE ROOM: This place is generally kept aside by Ostler Gundlgoot for those of his patrons who wish privacy-to game or confer or whatever, as it is In a dark and Incon­ spicuous comer. A secret door, a press and slide upwards panel, gives to a narrow stone staircase which leads to a secret room In the cellar. This place was used extensively during the time of trouble with the Temple of Elemental Evil, but it Is disused now, and most of the village folk know nothing about It. 4. BAR: This Is the proprietor's usual station. He sees to the fllling of jacks of ale, tankards of beer, and flagons of wine. Bolled eggs, cheeses, and hard biscuits or crackers are often atop the trestle. Serving girls carry the food trom here to the common room. There are great barrels of ale and ber, tuns of wine, and a cask of brandy with spigots ready tor the hosrs hand. A box under the bar holds 1 1  p.p., 47 g.p., 1 7  e.p., 33 s.p., and 61 c.p. In separate compartments. This ready money Is taken upstairs each night. Gundlgoot keeps about 1 00 g.p. equivalent In his apron pockets. 5. KITCHEN: The huge flreplace usually has various pats and kettles within, a roast turning, and several fowl kept worm in its side places. Goodwife Gundigoot is In charge here, keeping cook and scullions hopping. At the west end are the steps leading down to the cellar and up to the private apartment of the owner. Upper Floor: 1 .  PRIVATE ROOM: This chamber is rented by Zert, a chaotic evil flghter-S 16, 1 1 3, W9, D 15, C 1 1 , Ch 10: 2nd level, 1 2 hit polnts. He is ostensibly waiting tor the return of a caravan from the south, but he Is actually a spy for the Temple. He can drink great quantities without becoming drunk (200'J. normal capacity). He has a suit of scale mall, shield, sword, and dagger. He carries 20 g.p. in his purse, and he has 1 O 1 00  g.p. gems, 1 00 p.p., and 265 g.p. hidden in a locked coffer under some of his clothing. Saddlebags on a small table hold other garments, and a small leather pouch In plain view contains 40 g.p., 1 2  e.p., and 27 s.p. His medium warhorse and lance are In the stable. He will happily go with adventurers tor an equal share of treasure, and he will as readily betray them, help to slay them, and then take their goods. He Is not aware that the traders are also evil minions of the Temple, although they know who and what Zert is. 2. PRIVATE SUITE: The noble or wealthy rent this suite at 5 g.p. per night, breakfast furnished. The outer room Is a siting room 0RjGiilAL A.DVEilTV'S REi ilCAR!IATED • THE TElhPLE 0F ELElhEilTA.L EVIL with table and choirs, while the Inner hos a huge feather bed, choirs, and a closet. 3.

PRIVATE ROOM: This place Is currently the lodgings of one Spugnoir, a 2nd level magic-user-$ 1 1 ,  1 15, W 1 1 ,  D 15, C 14, Ch 7; 4 hit points. This chop come Into the village with a merchant wagon, and he is staying In hopes of gathering spells, for he knows only detect magic, read magic, and sleep. He wears a dagger, and a large trunk holds his magical porophemollo, clothing, and a fair assortment of dungeon exploration materials (you decide what), for he plans to quietly search the ruined moot house, having learned that a warlock was housed there. His dress is non­ descript as he does not wish to attract attention or be recognized as a magic-user. Spugnolr Is a chaotic neutral. His funds currently amount to 1 1  p.p., 9 g.p., and 7 s.p. in his wallet, and 3 50 g.p. gems he hos secreted In the hem of his cloak. If approached and offered oil scrolls found, he will go with a party. Otherwise, he will attempt to shadow the group and get what he con. 6. PRIVATE ROOM: With extra table and choirs, 2112 g.p. 7. PRIVATE ROOM: 1 g.p. per night. 8. PRIVATE ROOM: The comfortable room Is the quarters of one Fumok of Ferd, a 4th level thlef-5 8, I 14, W 1 0, D 1 8, C 1 5, Ch 1 3; 1 8  hit points. This fellow loves to gamble, and he hos loaded knuclclebones and knows how to nick cords (this gives him a 75% probability of winning at dice, 60% of winning at cords. Furnok hos leather armor, a ring of lnvlslblllly, a scroll of protection from magic, and a short sword. His funds consist of a small hoard of gems (37 50 g.p. each) and 1 2 each of s.p. and g.p. for gambling. He Is careful to ploy so as to not be caught cheating, and he makes a modest IMng thus, mostly skinning passing merchants. If offered a chance to adventure, Fumok will be willing to go along for on equal shore-plus all he con surreptltlously lift (particularly magic Items which he covets). To show his good faith, however, he will put up his scroll, hoping to parlay It into for more. If the worst should come, he hos a +1 dagger hidden In his boot. 9. PRIVATE ROOM: This place houses a strange pair, a hulking fighter of 2nd level-5 1 8/1 0, I 6, W 8, D 1 7, C 1 6, Ch 1 1 ;  20 hit points; splint moll and shield, sword, dagger (lance flail, axe, and heavy warhorse in stobles)-Kobort by name; and his associate, a small and thin monk of 3rd level-5 1 5, I 9, W 1 5, D 1 5, C 1 1 ,  Ch 5; 1 1  hit points; two daggers, quarter stolf­ colled Turuko, a Bokluni from unknown ports. Kebort was passing through and fell in with the monk, and Turuko convinced the huge fellow that he could make them wealthy and famous. The fighter is neutral (for he Isn't bright enough to be any alignment), while Turuko is lawful evil. The monk believes himself to be highly clever, and his pion Is to waylay and rob adventurers returning from a successful expedition to the ruined moot house, for he knows that there ore monsters and treasure there. The poirwlll accompany a small party, hong bock in fights, and then slay the expedition when It Is weak. Otherwise, they will spy on a large group, and attack only if It is reduced by death and wounds. They currently hove only 1 2  g.p., 5 s.p., and 40 c.p. between them, and something must be done soon, soys Turuko . . . . 1 0. DORM ITORY SLEEPING ROOM: Here most of the lesser travellers con spend a worm and safe night for a mere silver noble (1 s.p.). There ore a dozen or so pallets, and In the morning the table In the center Is loaded with hot tea and fresh loaves at no extra cost. Even these folks receive worm water and clean towels for morning ablutions, such Is the quality of the Welcome Wench Inn! There ore always 2-1 2 (or morel) sleeping here. 1 1 .  SPARE ROOM: If the Inn is exceptionally crowded, this place will be rented, but It normally quarters the potboys and scullions, for Ostler Gundlgoot Is a very kind master, and on cold nights he will hove a fire in the room, tool 9 1 2. SERVING WENCHES ROOM: Two wenches currently shore this chamber, although there ore cots for four, and when the season arrives, there will be one or two likely losses hired on. 1 3. GUNDIGOOfS CHILDREN$' ROOM: The two young daughters ore quartered here, under the watchful eye of Goodwtfe Gundlgoot. 1 4. GUNDIGOOTS' CHAMBER: In addition to bed, dresser, and armoire, Ostler Gundlgoot and his wife hove a small side room where accounts ore kept and the riches stored. A small secret comportment in the north wall holds a locked iron box. Inside ore 6 pieces of jewelry ( 1 ,000 x 2, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 and 5,000), a sock of 1 00 p.p., and a sock of 400 g.p. A ladder leads to the loft over the small portion of the place, and a concealed door from there leads to the attic otthe Inn proper. If there Is anyone of highly suspicious nature, Gundigoot will get the Druid of the Grove and spy upon the room concerned by means of small sliding ceiling panels. 15. PARLOR: This Is the IMng and dining area for the family of Ostler Gundigoot. It hos heavy furniture, polished brass pieces (candlesticks, et al.), tapestries, and so forth, which show comfortable amuence. Cellar: 1 .  STORAGE AREA: There ore socks of various stuffs for the kitchens, boxes, barrels of flour. etc. There ore herbs and other Items hung from the beams overhead. This section of the basement Is kept worm and dry from the actMty in area 2. 2. SUMMER KITCHEN: In very hot weather cooking which can not be handled on a fire outside is done here, and in winter additional cooking Is also done here, so the area is dry and wormer than the remainder of the cellar. Scullions and menials sometimes sleep here. Various foodstuffs are stored in cupboards, as are extra plates, platters, etc. 3. LOCKED STORAGE: A well and heavy stone walls keep this room cool, and here perishable cheeses, butter, meats, and so on ore kept. Smaller barrels of ale, beer, mead, and table wine ore also In this room. 4. LOCKED STORAGE: This is the wine cellar, and the rarest wines and brandies In butts and tuns are along the walls, while sheMng In the center holds small casks and pottery jars of the some. 5. MAIN CELLAR: Various old furniture and unused Items are stored here and there, along with empty crates, hogsheads and borrels, rusty tools, on old wheelbarrow, and so forth. A large supply of cordwood is stocked to either hand just at the entry so as to assure plenty of dry fuel for the many fire­ places of the hostel. 6. HUGE CASKS: In addition to a number of empty kegs, barrels, hogsheads, pipes, butts, and tuns, there ore three great casks here. Two hove some dregs of wine In them, but the third Is empty. A portion of the side swings up to allow entry Into the Interior, and a hidden catch allows the for end to swing Inward where yet another secret door In the wall con be pushed Inwards If triggered by Insertion of a dagger blade In the proper crock in the fieldstone wall. 7. ASHPIT: The sweepings from the fireplace above ore dumped down here from a chute above. They ore gathered period­ ically for use In soap making orforfertlllzer. Usually, ashes from the other fireplaces In the Inn ore stored here too, as there Is a grinder and separator mechanism here-as well as no fire hazard since the place Is entirely of stone or iron. (This area Is included because curious player characters will hove one hell of a time trying to find something worthwhile here). 8. DISUSED SECRET ROOM: When evil held sway in the terrttory, this place served as the meeting room and headquarters of the folk opposed to the Temple. It still contains many bunks built along the walls, several tables and benches, stools, and carefully stored arms, with metal greased against rust-1 2 long swords, 1 2  short swords, 1 2  daggers, 3 maces, 7 botleoxes, 3 hand oxes, 20 javelins, 8 spears, 1 30 crossbow bolts, 7 crossbows, 1 bordlche, 3 gloive-gulsormes, 2 bill- 0RjGiilAL ADVEil'f'VRJ;S REiilCA1'_IlATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EilTAL EVIL guisarmes, 4 partisans, 2 momlngstars-held against future bad times. Food and clothing and bedding are easily moved to the place from the inn. Some 1 0  bucklers and 1 7  shields are hung on the walls. Helmets and several (1 2 of each) leather jacks are kept in a great wooden chest. The ceiling of this room is very low compared with the overhead space elsewhere In the cellar, for a false basement crawl space exists between it and the inn noor above, the crawlspace being nagged with stones and a layer of earth. Thus, this room is nearly soundproof.

The dogs will bite and snap at handlers at every opportunity, and they will certainly run away (and return to the traders) as soon as they are not tied fast. (Naturally, the traders will claim that it is a 10 case of caveat emptor or that the dog Is absolutely another which resembles the one purchased only superficially, perhaps adding a spot of dye to alter its appearance.)

A locked Iron coffer holds 200 g.p., a ring set with an emerald (3,00 g.p. value) and a scroll of seven spells which Burne Is debating whether to use to expand his spell book or to save for an emergency. The scroll contains: mirror Image, pyrotechnics, web, read languages, suggestion, Ice storm, and rock to mud. His spell book is camouflaged to appear as the seat of the only armchair in the room. 7. HALL: The ladderwayfrom below exits here, where an Iron door leads to the parapet surmounting the lower tower. Another lodderway extends to the upper level of the turret. A barrel of 20 Javelins Is beside the door. PARAPET: As noted previously, the battlement Is machi· colated, the merlons pierced for archers, and at positions marked A. there are light catapults-one at each-with smooth boulders and small rocks stacked around the base of the turret and near the engines as well. Two guards are on duty here. 8. MERCENARY CAPTAIN'S ROOM. This chamber Is sparsely furnished, with a score of arrows and 1 00  crossbow bolts stored near the door. A small coffer holds 1 73 p.p. and 2 1 ,00 g.p. gems. Se below for statistics of the individual. 9. MERCENARY LIEUTENANTS ROOM: This room Is much the same as the captain's quarters, except that there are 8 quivers full of arrows here and no bolts. He has a purse with 15 1 00  g.p. gems, and 50 g.p. in It. 1 o. TOP LEVEL OF TURRET: The place Is filled with racked pallets for the men-at-arms, who generally sleep here but are otherwise elsewhere. 1 1 .  TURRET ROOF: This position Is reached by ladder from below. The batlement machicolated, with pierced merlons. There are two scorpions here, along with a long box which holds 30 0RiGiIIAL ADVEIITV'S REiIICAR!IATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EIITAL EVIL MEN-AT-ARMS: heavy spears which they fire.

THE RUINS OF THE MOATHOUSE This place was once the outpost of the Temple of Elemental Evil, its watchtower and advance base for raids, looting, and destruc­ tion. From this area, seivants of the Temple were to bring the Village of Hommlet and all the lands around It Into subjection. The subjugated folk were then to be used as slaves to construct yet another fortress further west, as the evil power of the Temple spread In ever-growing rings to encompass all of the land round Its base. In fact, this outpost was Ignored In the destruction ofthe Temple, for the army of good which came against the wicked hordes was so strong as to be totally Immune to any pinpricking from the garrison of the moathouse. Only after the battle which destroyed the main armies of the Temple of Elemental Evil had ended was attention turned to this place. Then, a detachment of horse and foot with a small siege train came to the marshlands to lay the castle low. The common folk for miles came to help, and the moathouse was surrounded, cut off, and battered Into extinction. The place Is now shunned by the people of Hommlet, who hate Its former evil and the memory of the terror brought to them by the black lord of the fortress, a vile cleric of damnation, and his evil men and humanoid troops. A scrub of thorns, thistles, weeds, and shrubs grows thickly along the edge of the track which leads to the ruins, and even the track ls mostly overgrown and cluttered with fallen branches and trees. 12 Here and there It Is washed out, In other places a mire. Evidently some game still follow the pathway, however, for alter a mile or so faint pathways con be seen. Even considering this, going Is slow, and It takes over an hour to reach the place on horseback, two to trudge along on foot, and considerable hacking and clearing Is necessary to make the way passable the first time, so double the time Is required. Alter two miles of distance, the land begins to sink and become baggy, as the track turns more northerty, and toll marsh plants grow thickly where cattails and tamaracks do not. Off to the left can be seen the jagged silhouette ot the moathouse. The track continues past the ruins for many miles-seven leagues, In fact-until the temple area Is reached. A side path, banked high to cross over the wet land to either side, juts north to the entrance of the ruined place. The track here Is only about 15' or so wide, with crumbling enbankments making travel near the edge dangerous. The bogs here stink, and the vegetation appears dense and prolific, but somehow sickly and unhealthy, creepers and vines throwing their strongllng loops over the skeletons of dead saplings and living bushes alike. The rushes and cattails rustle and bend even when only a slight zephyr blows over the marsh, and weird bird calls, croaklngs, and other unwholesome sounds come faintly across the fen. 0RjGiilAL A.DVEil'fV'S REi ilCARJIA'fED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEilTAL EVI L Encounter Key to the Upper Level: RANDOM ENCOUNTERS ON THE UPPER LEVEL: Encounter ocurs 1 In 12, check each tum: 1. 2-8 giant rots (see #13., below) 2. scraping noise (materials above shi1ting) 3. giant tick overhead (see #16. below) 4. squeaking and rustling (rats in the floor below) 5. 2-5 brigands (reinforcements for # 7., below) 6. footsteps (trick of echoes-party's own) Note that all monsters encountered are In addition to those Indicated on the key hereafter. Reference is given to encounter areas only to aid handling of the type. 1. 6 GIANT FROGS (H.P.: 13, 10, 7, 6, 4, 4): AC 7; HD 2 (x2), 1 (x4); Move 3"//9"; 1 attack for 1-6 (x2) or 1-3 (x4) hit points of damage. These nasty things wil leap from their lurking places In the tall weds near the edge of the pool, attacking madly, for they are voraciously hungry at all times. They will surprise the party 1 through 4 on d6. If mounted, check to see If the horses ponlc and throw their riders or plunge into the marsh and become mired. The two larger frogs weigh over 150 pounds each, and If their prey Is over 5' from them, they will employ their tongues to wrap and draw the victim to their mouth. The others merely attempt to bite their prey to death. The largest frog has a 100 g.p. gem inside, while the others have nothing. 2. ROTTING DRAWBRIDGE: When the moothouse was taken, part of the drawbridge was battered through, and men crossed on planks to gain access to the Inner gates. The chains of the drawbridge were broken, and It fell. It has remained thus since. It is strong enough to bear a man, but there is a 50°k chance that any horse crossing it will break through and injure a leg (30'1. for mules and 20'J. for ponies). 3. BliOKEN GATES: One door is hanging open on one great hinge, the other is splintered and holed but still in position, wedged and shored closed from Inside. A careful examina­ tion of the ground here will reveal that there ore boot prints in the ground heading for the building steps at location 5. 4. TOWER WITH UPPER PORTION COLLAPSED: The inside is too dark to determine what is there If an arrow slit is peered through, and even infravislon will reveal nothing, for its occupant lurks above: HUGE SPIDER (H.P.: 14):AC 6; Move 18"; HD 2+2; 1 attackfor1- 6 hit points of damage, plus save vs. poison at +1. Surprises on 1 through 5 in 6. This great wolf spider is crouched on the remains of an upper floor some 15' overhead, and as soon as anyone steps into the tower it will leap and bite! A scattering of husks and a few bones on the floor of the place might give the characters a warning, although the gleam of coins might tempt investigation, for there ore 38 s.p. and 71 c.p. amidst the rubbish, as well as an ivory box about the size of a large book which Is easily worth 50 g.p. or more to the right buyer. 5. LITTERED STEPS TO THE HOUSE PORTION OF THE FORTRESS: Again, a careful examination of these steps will show that some tratnc (human, animal, and perhaps otherwise) comes this way. The doors at the head of the stairs ore broken-one flat on the floor, the other sundered. 6. GREAT HALL: Destroyed furniture, tattered banners and tapestries on the walls, and heaps of rotting cloth thrown into comers show that this was once a great audience chamber, richly appointed, which hos been thoroughly searched, socked, and despoiled. Leaves and dirt cover the floor, and cobwebs hong from walls and the ceiling above. Looking up, the party will see that pieces of beams and chunks of stone poke through, Indicating that the upper stories of the place ore totally destroyed and likely to be impassable to any creature larger than a rot. 7. BRIGANDS: There ore 8 normal men and a 2nd level fighter leader holed up In the "Block Chamber", the quarters of the 13 former lord of the castle. The heavy door hos been repaired by these outlaws, and It can be barred as well as bolted as It usually is. The brigands are: Armor Hit Number ArmorType Weapons Class Points leader chain & shield sword, spear 4 17 2 ring moll & shield flail, sword 6 6 3 leather crossbow, club 8 4 4 leather & shield spear, hand axe 7 5 5 leather crossbow, mace 8 3 6 studded leather halberd 7 6 7 leather crossbow, sword 8 5 8 podded & shield sword, 3 javelins 7 3 9 leather voulge 8 4 A pair of brigands Is 50'1. likely to have ben at location 3., thus seeing the party approach and having given a warning to the group. Another watcher always pers out the escape route, the ruined wall and the stepping stones across the moat in the southeast comer of the chamber. If the party appears weak, the brigands will hide in the clutter of wrecked furniture In the room, and toke the entrants by surprise 1 through 5 In 6. If the party looks reasonably capable, theywill lock their door and leave if it is battered, toking their petty loot only and leaving the rest safely hidden. If the adventurers appear overwhelming, they will sneak out as soon as the party enters the moathouse, taking all of their loot with them and heading for greener postures. Each brigand has from 3-18 s.p. with him, and number 2 has 2- 8 g.p. and 3-12 e.p. as well. The leader has þ20 p.p., 1-2 50 g.p. gems, and a gold chain worth 200 g.p. They hove a chest buried under the rubble where the wall collapsed. It holds 2,000 c.p., 2 bolts of fine cloth worth 60 g.p. each, a crystal flagon and four goblets worth 80 g.p., an Inlaid wooden box with ivory handles and decorations worth 45 g.p., and 4 +1 magic arrows. Three turns of digging ore required to uncover the chest of loot. The chamber is floored in block flagstones, has ebon-colored wall hangings-burnt and tattered now -and the jumbled wreckage noted. The brigands pitch bedrolls in odd comers, and the remains offlres can be noted in the northern fireplace. They are totally unaware of the secret door and staircase down to the dungeons. 8. STAIRWAY UP: Alter a few steps the risers are covered with dust, crushed stone, broken wood, and burnt heaps of cloth. At the landing half way up they are completely choked with rubble, and It is Impossible to clear the loose stone and huge wall section so as to allow passage. (The entire upper floor Is collapsed and ruined in any case.) 9. LITTERED ROOM: This place is empty, and Its dirt and wreckage show no signs of any recent occupant, although a small rat or two will be seen scurrying away. It was once a conference chamber. There is nothing of any value within except a very fine broadsword wedged behind a splintered wall case, whose contents ore long gone. 10. EMPTY BED CHAMBER: Once the quarters of a castle troop leader or some other petty omclol, the place Is now a total wreck, the bed chopped to pieces, the funlture smashed or gone. 11. SALON: This room was once very opulent, obviously a place where many expensive furnishings were, for the bits and tatters that remain still look rich (although there Is nothing of value felt). If the party seeks to investigate the room, scores of bats will angrily flutter around, and In the confusion It Is 759k likely that whatever is held for a llght source will be dropped and be extinguished. If anyone is striking at these bots when the lights go out, It is 50°k likely that he or she will strike a party member-the one nearest. If a hit is scored, normal damage from the weapon accrues to the unfortunate victim. 12. GIANT SNAKE (H.P.: 23):AC 5; HD 4 + 2; Move 15"; 1 attockfor1- 3 hit points of damage, plus saving throw versus polson­ sove equals 1-3 additional hit points, failure equals 2-8 hit points damage. This huge odder Is over 12' long. It crawled 0NGiilAL ADVEilTVS REiilCARJIATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEllIEilTAL EVIL up the rubble spilled into the moat, and It found a nice safe lair where It could hole up after hunting. (The brigands give this whole corridor a wide berth after one of their number was killed by the reptile some weeks ago.) In the litter of Its nesting place Is a jewelled dagger worth 850 g.p. 13. STOREROOM AND STAIRWAY TO DUNGEON: Some rustling and squeaking will betray the presence of a hungry horde of: 13 GIANT RATS (H.P.: 4x4, 2x3, 3x2, 4x1 ):AC 7; HD ȕ; Move 1 26 //66; 1 attack for 1-3 hit points; 5°b chance per bite of lnftlctlng disease. These rodents lair on the shelves along the walls, and some lurk around the staircase. They are hungry and will attack without fear. Although they have no treasure, an upper shelf of the storage area hos on overlooked jug of oil (equivalent of 1 O ftasks), and on the fifth stair down Is a gold ring worth 40 g.p. (but unless the party is searching the area, there is only a 5°b chance per person using the stairs that it will be seen-check for each). 14. EMPTY TROPHY ROOM: Only a few mangy pelts, stuffed heads, and shattered antlers indicate the former status of the chamber. All worthwhile Items ore looted. It is possible to spend considerable time searching the litter here, but nothing of value will be found. 1 5. EMPTY ROOM: The place was the domicile of the major-domo of the castle, but It Is stripped of everything save broken and ruined furnishings now. One wall cresset remains near the outer wall, and its torch stub is actually a silver baton worth 30 g.p. in its present condition. 16. DESERTED KITCHEN: The remains of moldering foodstuffs and kitchen work tables ore visible. A wooden cask near the fireplace on the north wall looks inviting, but if anyone approaches It he or she will be attacked by a GIANT TICK (H.P.: 19):AC 3; HD 3; Move JN; 1 attockfor1-4 hltpolnts plus 1- 6 hit points of blood drain thereafter. This horror came in through the chimney. it has no treasure. 1 7. PARTIALLY COLLAPSED CHAMBER: Remains of cots and plain wooden chests indicate that this was once a barracks room for some of the castle guards-undoubtedly the human sort. If the overhead rubble Is forcefully moved there is a 50°b chance per round that it will fall further, causing 1-6 hit points of damage to each character in the place-check each round that anyone shoves or levers it. Near the south end of the room is an intact chest, and a monster as well: GIANT LIZARD (H.P.: 16): AC 5; HD 3 +1; Move 15'; 1 attack for 1-8 hit points of damage; double damage on a score of 20 (snapped both jaws on prey). Inside the creature is a +1 shield. The intact chest holds 33 c.p., a scale mail tunic, a light crossbow, and a case of 24 crossbow bolts. Encounter Key to Dungeon Level: RANDOM DUNGEON ENCOUNTERS: Encounter occurs 1 In 6, check each tum. 1. ogre (small, 13 hit points; see 7., below) 2. 3-12 giant rats (se 13 .. above) 3. thumping (lizard above out hunting or passing criter) 4. 2-8 zombies (see 4., below) 5. 1-2 bugbears (patrol, see 1 0  .. below) 6. moaning (wind blowing through some cracks and crevasses) 7. distant rattling (could be anything) 8. 2-5 gnolls (patrol, see 1 2  .. below) Note that all monsters encountered are in addition to those Indicated on the key hereafter. Reference Is given to encounter areas only to aid handling of the type. 1. GREEN SLIME: (H.P.: 1 0, 7):AC 7; HD 2; MoveO (drops); contact with exposed ftesh turns victim to green slime in 1-4 rounds. These two nauseous blobs of matter have been carefully placed and fed In a position over the central arch of the stairway. Any person coming down the stairs and stepping olf Into the dungeon ftoor Is 75'1. likely to cause one of the two 'slimes to dislodge itself and fall squaretyuponthevlctlm.Any 14 cautious approach, either looking up or moving along the walls, will avoid this; but then anyone passing through the northern portion of the 1 0' square will run the same (75°b) risk of being attacked. There Is no treasure. A few tom sacks, broken barrels, and shattered weapons racks show that this large area was once a storage place and armory for the fortress. There are great heaps of worthless rubble and broken containers and furniture at the western end of the room-all obviously junk (but hiding the two doors to rooms 2 and 3). 2. LOCKED DOOR: Obviously, the loct< is new and well-oiled. The door will have to be chopped/smashed down by axe and/or hammer, taking 50 points to splinter and open. Inside are 30 shields, 1 2  suits of leather armor, and barrels of salted meat (behind which are two 5 gallon kegs of brandy worth 80 g.p. each). 3. LOCKED DOOR: Same as 2 .. above. Behind this portal are 50 spears, 1 O glaives, 6 guisarmes, 3 batleaxes, 70 black capes with a yellow eye of fire sewed on them, more containers of provisions, and two crates holding 1 20 arrows and 200 crossbow bolts respectively. 4. CORRIDOR LINED WITH CELLS: Anyone entering this area will be attacked by the monsters lurking In pairs In these cubicles: 1 2  ZOMBIES (H.P.: 1 5, 14, 13, 1 2, 3x10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4): AC 8; HD 2; Move 66; 1 attack for 1-8 hit points of damage; always strike last, but piercing weapon hits cause only 1 hit point of damage. The zombies will come shumlng forth Immediately upon the entry of any character, so the engagement will be with but a pair initially, another pair coming Into combat on each successive melee round. They will try to drive the intruders Into area 5. Although there is no treasure with these monsters. a 500 g.p. gem was long ago hidden behind a loose stone in the last cell, and if the party searches this cell, It Is 50°b likely per searcher per round that the loose piece In the wall will be detected. 5. TORTURE CHAMBER: At first glance this place will seem long abandoned, for dust, dirt, and cobwebs abound. A careful perusal will show that several of the skeletons In the place are recently dead, and some of the Instruments and mech­ nlsms have ben used very recently Indeed. Some drops of blood can be noticed trolling south IF MINUTE CARE IS TAKEN IN INSPECTING THE FLOOR. Without such a lead It is 90°b unlikely that the secret door in the pillar will be discovered (check only once for each lndMdual looking, but roll dice as if normal checks were being made). lfthe blood troll (from a sloppy ghoul) Is noted, the chances of locating the secret door mechanism are normal-in this case 1 In 6 for non-elven characters, 2 in 6 for elven. Inside the column Is a shaft some 30' deep, with iron rungs set Into the stonework for descent. They are obviously used. 0RJGiilAL A.DVEilTV'S REi ilCARJIATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EilTA.L EVIL 6. LITTERED STOREROOM: The mess of filth and broken junk Is completely unremarkable. If the party Is cautious, however, they will be 50% likely to note grease on the door hinges if they examine the door once it is opened. (Note that It opens on a 1 - 4 for an average strength person, and it makes no noise when so doing). 7. OGRE (H.P.: 21 ): AC 5; HD 5 +1; Move 9"; 1 attack using bardlche for 2-8 +5 (7-13) hit points of damage. This creature has ben lured Into seivtce by the promise of gauds and fresh meat-plenty of It being human flesh, of course. He has been instructed to guard the room against any creatures who do not wear the symbol of the new master (the yellow eye of fire) and/ or know the proper secret sign (crossed arms before the face). Any porty entering will not be Instantly attacked, but If they do not make the secret sign, even If property dressed, Lubash (the ogre) will attck. He will devour any killed at the first opportunity, and toss wounded and prisoners Into room 8. He will pursue a fleeing party, but only as far as the stairs up ( 1., above). Lubash has a heap of old clothing and skins for a bed, and a large wooden chest with his treasures-worthless glass beads, brass candlesticks and other trash, 823 c.p., 46 s.p., and 3 g.p. However, by some trick of fate, a small-sized elven cloak is intermixed with the old carpeting and rags of his nest. 8. HEAVILY BARRED OAK DOOR: This is Lubash's pantry. The grisly larder currently contains a pair of humans who have undergone only mild torture, and a badly beaten gnome whom Lubash Intended to dine upon soon-a mere snack, and tough, but a nice change nonetheless. The humans will admit to being merchants, and bath will promise large re· wards for their release, vowing to send the monies to Hommlet as soon as they return to Dyvers. Four weeks after their release a passing caravan will deliver 100 s.p. per merchant to the rescuers . . .  The gnome was caught spying by some gnolls, and he too will ask to be freed, giving a plain Iron ring to whomever first so agrees. This ring is recognized 7ø of the time by gnomes within 100 miles of the areas as a sign that the bearer Is an ally, thus making It 25% more probable that they will be friendly and helpful. 9. TRAP AND TRAP RELEASE AREAS: The party will not notice that a huge iron grate falls from above at this point, for the underside Is even with the tunnel ceillng 1 5' above, and painted a grayish brown to blend with the stone. The secret door leads to a winch which hauls the grate back up. The trap Is triggered at locations 1 1  .. below. 10. 6 BUGBEARS (H.P.: 1 7, 14, 1 2, 2x1 1, 9):AC 5; HD 3 + 1; Move 9"; 1 attack for 2-8 hit points damage each. These creatures have recently been recruited by the New Master (see 18., below), and each has 1 2  g.p. The leader ( 1 7 hit points) has a silver necklace set with 5 chrysoprase gems (4 x 50, 1 x 1 00  g.p. value) worth 450 g.p. which he wears as a bracelet. If any lights are shown In the chamber to the south, these creatures wil pad down to investigate . . .  They surprise opponents 5ø of the time and will attack. They know only that the "Master" is quartered somewhere to the south. 11. FALSE DOOR: When this door is pulled open, a bare stone wall is revealed behind. At the same time a distant clangor will sound-the grate falling. 12. 9 GNOLLS (H.P.: 14, 1 2, 3x10, 3x9; 7): AC 5; HD 2; Move 9"; 1 atack for 2-8 hit points damage, 2 gnolls are armed with great longbows In addition to batleaxes. Originally there weie 14 of these humanoids recruited to raid and pillage, but activities to the east and south have taken their toll. Each gnoll has 3-18 s.p. and a like number of coppers as well. The leader has a 10 g.p. gem and 1 1  g.p. as well. These monsters are not pleased with their loot nor with the greater status accorded to the bugbears newly joined. They will fight fiercely, even to the death, but If a parley otter Is made they will be 75% Inclined to stop and listen; and If they are offered 6 or more gold pieces each, with three or more times that amount for the leader, they will desert. If double the above Is Initially offered and paid, they will lead the party to the north passage going to where "Master" Is, and even tell the party 1 5 that there are human guards. The gnolls will then proceed east to the exit and never come back. Remember that conversation with these creatures must be In gnoll, bugbear or ogre speech. 13. GIANT CRAYFISH IN POOL (H.P.: 27): AC 4; HD 4 +4; Move 6" //1 2"; 2 attacks for 2-1 2 hit points each. When the dungeons were dug a natural pool of water was found, and as it was considerably below floor level, the area was dug lower and the entrance to the pool enlarged. Evidently, some connection to on underground stream exists, for some time ago, this monster took the pool as its own, and It now disputes with any creatures entering, hoping to make a meal In the bargain. (It Is held at bay by the men-at-arms from area 16., below, by pole arms and prodding; all others take their chances.) The monster has been fairly successful, and there are bones and litter around and in the pool, although the central section is very deep. If badly wounded, the crayfish retreats Into the deep water of the pool and does not return for at least a day. There ore 19 g.p., 30 s.p., and 1 7  c.p. and a sword near the back (southwest) pool edge. In the water on a ledge Is a platinum pin set with a ruby (2,000 g.p. value) and a bone tube. The pin is under a skull (human) and the tube under some bones. Unless searchers use their hands, there is a 50% chance that either or both treasures will slip otf the ledge and be lost below. The tube Is water-tight and contains a scroll of magic-user spells (push, stinking cloud, fly). 14. BURIAL CRYPTS: The builders planned for a long tenancy, although expectations were not met. Most of the niches are empty, although a few contain splintered comns. wrappings, and gnawed and split bones (a sure sign that all ls not quite well . . .  ). Squatting in the south end of the room are: 4 GHOULS (H.P.: 12, 10, 8, 7):AC 6; HD 2; 3attacksfor1-4/1-4/1- 8 hit points per attack (claw/claw/bite). Any human or deml­ human creature struck by a ghoul must save versus paralyzation or become lmmoblle for 3-1 2  turns. These creatures get corpses to eat from the "Master" -sometimes even prey not dead so that these horrible creatures can have some "sport" (area 5., above) before dining. They will attack immediately upon seeing the party. A The back of a crypt Is broken out and there Is an earth tunnel, foul and damp and only about 5' high. It leads to a noisome den (A) where a heap of bones and skulls Is made where the ghouls nest. In this mess Is the following treasure: 800 s.p., 7 vials of holy water, a potion of undead control, and a scroll of protection from undead. A trail of gold pieces ( 1-4 per 1 O' of tunnel) begins at area B. B. A waren of small (3' diameter and smaller) burrows starts here. Mapping is not possible. After about 30' the gold can no longer be found, and If the party continues past the portion shown on the map, simply allow them to proceed for another hundred or so fet, and then tell them they are hopelessly lost. 1 5. The passage here begins to slant gradually upwards, and a slight breeze can be felt after 100 fet beyond the edge of the map.

If they are being defeated, guardsmen 0zjGiIIAL ADVEIITVRJ:S REiIICAR._IIATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEIITAL EVIL will begin howling, and the balance of the guards from 1 7., and "Master'' as well, will then proceed to the fray-3 rounds to reach 16., etc. Each guardsman has 1-4 p.p., 2-5 g.p., and 2-8 s.p.

Lareth the Beautiful is the dark hope of chaotic evil: young, handsome, well endowed In abilities and aptitudes, thor­ oughly wicked, depraved, and capricious. Whomever harms Lareth hod better not brag of it in the presence of one who will inform the Demoness Lolth! He has been sent into this area to rebuild a force of men and humanoid fighters to gather loot and restore the Temple of Elemental Evil to Its former glory. Of course, Loreth is but one of many so charged, but he is looked upon with special favor and expectation. He and his minions hove been careful to raid far from this area, never nearer than three or four leagues, traveling on foot or being carried In wagons of the traders from Hommlet. None of the victims are ever lelt alive to tell the tale, and mysterious disappearances are all that can be remarked upon, for no trace of men, mounts, goods, wagons or draft animals Is ever found. Evil to the core, Lareth is cunning, and if the situation appears In doubt, he will use bribery and honeyed words to sway the balance to his favor. He Is not at all adverse to gaining new recruits of any sort, and will gladly accept adventurers Into the ranks, but he will test and try them continually. Those who arouse suspicion will be quietly murdered In their sleep; those with too much promise will be likewise dealt with, for Lareth wonts no potential usurpers or threats to his domination. His room Is lavishly furnished with thick rugs, wall hangings, soft chairs and couch, cushions, wines and liquors, dishes of sweetmeats. A brazier continually bums to warm the place and send a fragrant incense Into the air. While he carries but 9 p.p. and a 1 ,000 g.p. gem with him, Loreth hos In plain sight silver serving pieces and goblets worth 4,00 g.p. and on alabaster bax full of unguent whose total value Is 800 g.p. These, and a string of matched fire opals ( 1 0,000 g.p. value In 1 O stones, plus gold settings with diamond chips and gold chain for a total worth of 15,000 g.p.), hew111 offer as a ransom for his life. Bound around Lareth's left arm Is a phylactery of action, a clerical magic Item which makes the wearer Impervious to poralyzation of any sort, Including a hold spell of any kind. Loreth's spells ore: First Level: Command, Cure Ught Wounds (x2), Protection from God, Sanctuary Second Level: Hold Person (x2), Know Alignment, Resist Fire, Siience 15' Radius Third Level: Cause Blindness, Continual Darkness Note: If Loreth Is slain, there will be Inquiries In Hommlet­ cautlous and discreet inqulries-butthe servants of evil there will make every attempt to find out what happened, and if any of the possessions of this cleric tum up, the slayers will be known, and on assassin of 1 Oth level who con speak the alignment language of the major character of the group will come to the village within 3 weeks and proceed to attempt to eliminate the offenders. As OM, you must handle this as you see flt. The cleric Terjon and the Druid of the Grove will certainly old the persons so attacked. If the assassin Is killed, nothing further will be attempted.

It is a world rich in history, intrigue, and magic . . .  a place of opportunity, and of danger as well. This story unfolds in a small part of that world, a very small part indeed. But this place, at the foot of the Kron Hills not far north of the great Azure Sea, could breed dan­ gers to threaten the nearby greater realms with the fine-sounding names-the Archclericy of Veluna, and the kingdoms of Celene and Furyondy. Hommlet and Nulb are two small villages, which squat in the vales between these great powers like two dark and tiny eyes, surrounded by the ancient wrinkled hills on the face of some evil demiurge. Players, you should each have a character of first or second level of experience. Your young novices are about to set forth on the path to adventure. The road may seem clear at first, but many twists and turns await you-in the near future, and in the far as well. Dungeon Master, your tasks are many. You must portray two entire villages, person by person. Scoundrels lurk in shadows, monsters prowl the nearby ruins, and all play their parts in the game. But the chal­ lenges, situations, or amusements they present are only as good as your skills. Start at the beginning, and stop when you feel the pinch of time. Resume your adven­ tures whenever you like; such is a role play­ ing game . Turn now to 'G ETTING STARTED' and prepare to set forth! GETTING STARTED Before starting the adventure, each Player should have the AD&D® PLAYERS HANDBOOK, a set of dice, and a 1st or 2nd level character (the group including at least one of each of the four major classes). The Dungeon Master needs the AD&D® DUNGEON MASTERS GUIDE, scrap paper, and dice. The three books of AD&D® game monsters can also help greatly. Also before the game, the DM should read and become roughly familiar with the entire adventure. Skip minor detail, concentrating on the overall themes and their connections in the different locales. If an encounter includes special notes which will apply before a party can react, highlight or mark such passages as a reminder, so you are sure of properly including each detail. DM, if you start the adventure before read­ ing the whole, limit the first game session to Hommlet itself. Then read at least enough in advance to keep ahead of the players. Appendix A gives a list of deities found in the WORLD OF GREYHAWK'" setting. The DM should review those notes with the players either before starting or at some time early in the characters' careers. Now have one player read the following Players' Background to the rest, supplying Map #1 for their reference. The background is a bit lengthy-but the road ahead is a long one, as well. PLAYER'S BACKGROUND The Village of Hommlett-or merely "Hommlett;' as it is commonly called-is situ­ ated in the central part of the Flanaess, that portion of western Oerik Continent which is known and 'civilized'. The hamlet-sized village (local parlance having distinguished it with the greater term) is located some 30 leagues south­ east of the town of Verbobonc, or there­ abouts, on the fringe of the territory controlled by the noble Lord the Viscount of 4 Verbobonc. It is at a crossroads. To the north is the mighty Velverdyva River, along whose south bank runs the Lowroad. Many days' travel to the east, on the shores of the Lake of Unknown Depths (Nyr Oyv), is the great walled city of Dyvers. The village of Sobanwych lies about halfway along the route. Below that to the southeast and east are miles and miles of forest (the Gnarley), beyond which is the Wild Coast, Woolly Bay, and the Sea of Gearnat. The road south forks a league or so beyond the little community, one branch meandering off towards the Wild Coast, the other rolling through the lower Kron Hills to the village of Ostverk and then eventually turning south­ wards again into the elven kingdom of Celene. The western route leads into the very heart of the gnomish highlands, passing through Greenway Valley about a day's travel distant and going onwards to the Lortmil Mountains far beyond. Hommlet grew from a farm or two, a rest house, and a smithy. The roads brought a sufficient number of travelers and merchant wagons to attract tradesmen and artisans to serve those passing through. The resthouse became a thriving inn, and a wheel and wainwright settled in the thorp. More farmers and herdsmen followed, for grain was needed for the passing animals, and meat was in demand for the innfolk. Prosperity was great, for the lord of the district was mild and taxed but little. Trade was good, and the land was untroubled by war, outlaws, or ravaging beasts. The area was free, beautiful, and bountiful-too much so, in the eyes of some. Whether the evil came west from Dyvers (as is claimed by one faction) or crept up out of the forestlands bordering the Wild Coast 0RjGiilAL ADVEil'fV'S REi ilCARJIATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEilTAL EVIL (as others assert), come it did. At first it was only a few thieves and an odd group of band­ its molesting the merchant caravans. Then came small bands of humanoids-kobolds or goblins-raiding the flocks and herds. Local militia and foresters of the Waldgraf of Ost­ verk apparently checked, but did not stop, the spread of outlawry and evil. A collection of hovels <1.nd their slovenly inhabitants formed the nucleus for the trou­ bles which were to increase. A wicked cleric established a small chapel at this point. The folk of Hommlet tended to ignore this place, Nulb, even though it was but 6 miles dis­ tant. But its out-of-the-way position was ideal for the fell purposes planned for this settlement, as was its position on a small river flowing into the Velverdyva. The thickets and marshes around Nulb became the lair and hiding place for bandits, bri­ gands, and all sorts of evil men and mon­ sters alike. The chapel grew into a stone temple as its faithful brought in their ill­ gotten tithes. Good folk were robbed, pil­ laged, enslaved, and worse. In but three years, a grim and forbidding fortress surrounded the evil place, and swarms of creatures worshipped and worked their wickedness therein. The servants of the Tem­ ple of Elemental Evil made Hommlet and the lands for leagues around a mockery of free­ dom and beauty. Commerce ceased, crops withered; pestilence was abroad. But the leaders of this cancer were full of hubris and, in their overweaning pride, sought to overthrow the good realms to the north, who were coming to the rescue of the land being crushed under the tyranny wrought by the evil temple. A great battle was fought. When the good people of Hommlet saw streams of ochre-robed men and humanoids fleeing south and west through their commu­ nity, there was great rejoicing, for they knew that the murderous oppressors had been defeated and driven from the field in panic and rout. So great was the slaughter, so complete the victory of good, that the walled strong­ hold of the Temple of Elemental Evil fell within a fortnight, despite the aid of a terrible demon. The place was ruined and sealed against a fur­ ther return of such abominations by powerful blesings and magic. Life in Hommlet quickly returned to a semblance of its former self, before the rise of the temple. For five years afterward, the village and the surrounding countryside have become richer and more prosperous than ever before. A monstrous troll which plagued the place for a time was hunted down by a party of passing adventurers. Carrying the ashes and a goodly fortune as well, the adventurers returned to the vil­ lage. Before going elsewhere to seek their fortunes, the adventurers also returned a portion of the villagers' losses. Other adven­ turers, knowing of the evil that had once resided in the area, came to seek out similar caches, and several did find remote lairs and wealth-just as some never returned at all. After a time, adventurers stopped coming to the area. It semed that no monsters were left to slay, and no evil existed here to be stamped out. The villagers heaved a collective sigh-some pained at the loss of income, but others relieved by the return to the quiet, nor­ mal life-and Homrnlet continued its quiet existence for four years more. But then, a year ago, the bandits began to ride the roads again-not frequently, but to some effect. To the good folk of Homrnlet, this semed al too familiar, so they sent word to the Viscount that wicked forces might still lurk thereabouts. This information has been spread throughout the countryside, and the news has attracted outsiders to the village once again. Who and what these men are, no one can be quite sure. All claim to be bent on slaying monsters and bringing peace and secu­ rity to Hommlet; but deeds speak more loudly than words, and lies cloak the true purposes of the malevolent. NOTES FOR THE DUNGEON MASTER This module is designed for beginning­ level play. Experienced players can also enjoy the scenario, but they should start new 1st level characters to do so. If you hap­ pen to have a group which is new to the game, allow them to bring their existing characters; there is no sense in requiring that they begin the business all over again. Experienced 1st, 2nd, and even 3rd level characters can easily begin in Hommlet. If characters are higher than level one, modify the material in the 'Getting Started' portion, of course. You should sharply limit the amount of gear and treasure they can bring to the village (as you will understand when you read the adventure). If your group of players has had exceptional luck, simply engineer a minor encounter or two along the way-light-fingered leprechauns, a thief or two, or perhaps some brigands-to rid them of a few of those cumbersome gems, coins, and magical items. 5 For each numbered area, general informa­ tion is given first. If the text is boxed, it may be read directly to the players. Otherwise, present the given information in your own words. If you are so thoroughly familiar with the module that you can simply glance at the name of the encounter area and then put eve­ rything in your own words, so much the bet­ ter. You should be conversant with the whole before begining play. Your players will, in tum, reflect and be inspired by your skill in presenting the material herein. Immediately following the player informa­ tion is more detailed and often secret material, which you should not reveal to the players. Review this carefuly as well, to be sure of the interrelationships and consequences of certain actions. The whole is quite general, in fact, and while some characteristics of the non-player characters (hereafter referred to as NPCs) are given, there is sufficient latitude for you to completely personalize the adventure to fit your style of play and satisfy your play­ ers. Follow the guidelines given, but round them out to make each encounter unique. The persons that are met at the inn, along the road, and so forth, are you; for the Dungeon Master is all-monsters, NPCs, and all else but player characters. Play it to the hilt. Do it with flair and wit. Be fair both to the characters and to yourself. Be cun­ ning but just and honest when in the role of a warding ranger. Be deceitful, clever, and thoroughly dishonest when acting the part of a thief. Think of the parts you take as those of characters you are playing, and act accordingly. But temper your actions with disinterest in the eventual outcome, and keep only the viewpoint of that particular role. Wearing two, three, or a dozen differ­ ent hats is challenging, but that is part of being an outstanding DM. The area of Hommlet, as well as that of the Temple, was developed in order to smoothly integrate players in the GREYHAWK cam­ paign (both experienced and otherwise) into a scenario related to the 'old timers' only by rel­ ative proximity. All had new characters, although experienced players were assigned characters with levels above 1st or 2nd. The whole attempt turned out quite well, and many of the NPCs in the adventure are the characters and henchmen developed through play. The situation and the surroundings have been altered because of the actual experiences of these participants, although the clock has been turned back to give you and your group 0NGiilAL A.DVEilTVRJ:S REi ITCAR._IlATED • THE TElhPLE 0F ELElhEllTA.L EVIL of players an opportunity to make history of your own. While I am strongly tempted to relate the events of the campaign we played, I believe it to be inappropriate to the adventure. (Ask me at a game convention, some time . . . .  ) Only some of the villagers are named. Please name the others to suit your cam­ paign. Most of the local folk are of the Old Faith-the druidical-and consider the Druid of the Grove (area 24) to be their spir­ itual caretaker. Many of the inhabitants are zero-level types; treat as 1-1 Hit Dice for purposes of combat, if such occurs (which should be infrequent at best). Floor plans for most of the buildings are not given, so you should design them for areas in which you expect action to occur. Change the map of Hommlet as the game progresses. Note any places destroyed, and add new ones for persons you move into the place. If a general battle seems likely, you can list the village militia and fight it out on the tabletop. In short, the scenario has been left as open as possible for your own taste in development. Have fun! As a final note, remember that the NPCs who are noted as agents of various powers will send a continuous stream of informa­ tion to their superiors. All will be cautious in their actions, and are unlikely to be duped or maneuvered. If they participate in any adventures, or if they are imprisoned or badly treated, their masters will be very unhappy if bad news is received. The con­ cerned parties will absolutely seek to redress matters according to their alignments, per­ sonalities, and ultimate goals. There are wheels within wheels in the Vil­ lage of Hommlet and the lands around. Behind each person lurks another, the cir­ cles growing wider and the figures shadowy but very powerful. OTHER ADVENTURES Though characters who start their careers in Hommlet should, after finishing with the place, be able to take on the villains of Nulb and the Temple, not all adventurers are lucky. Some characters will no doubt perish in the course of this adventure, and events will not always proceed as planned. As OM, you should gauge the progress of the players and characters alike. If they need more sea­ soning before continuing to the greater chal­ lenges, you may-and should-design and develop other adventures in the area. The details of such 'side jaunts' are left entirely to you. The myriad details of your cam­ paign and personal preferences will suggest some natural outgrowths, as will the actions of the characters, if well-played. Hereafter are a few brief ideas for your own develop­ ment as needed or desired. Hommlet and Nulb: If you develop the lat­ ter village in the manner given for the former, many natural developments will suggest themselves. New arrivals of typical townsfolk should be fairly common, and NPC adventur­ ers will arrive with regularity. Some of the lat­ ter may be of interest or use, available as hirelings or mercenaries. Some will have their own ideas for adventure, and may assemble a rival party which the PCs may encounter now and again in their explorations. And of course, few are what they sem, and some may be quite powerful. Think of the day-to-day life in these small villages, and imagine the needs of the local folk. A new mill or winery would not find much welcome, as these are already repre­ sented in Hommlet. But a new blacksmith might provide a convenient excuse, in draw­ ing off business, for Elmo and/or Otis to become a bit more active in their secret tasks. A new butcher, candlemaker, dairy­ man, fisherman, glassblower, hunter, milli­ ner, and/or potter might arrive and prosper in either village, perhaps bringing news, hidden professional skills, or other develop­ ments to the campaign. If some minor but nevertheless entertain­ ing foray would provide a means for low­ level characters to gain those extra few points needed to gain a level, design an interlude accordingly. It need not fit any greater campaign purpose, but should be logical to the setting. The random encounter charts for the Hommlet and Nulb areas should stimulate a few ideas. As the local situation changes with the activity (or lack of activity) of the PCs, any number of noteworthy events might occur. The factions of the Temple, being Chaotic and not well-organized as yet, may decide on a brief and probably premature foray into the countryside. Some individual might arrive to replace Lareth the Beautiful (of the ruined moat-house, assuming that PCs end his promising career). And as greater chal­ lenge, evil elemental forces could be sent forth from the dungeons to test the speed and severity of the reactions of the forces of Good-a small and simple probe in the broader tactics of Zuggtmoy, luz, and the rest. The King of Furyondy, one of the 6 greater powers concerned with and care­ fully watching the activity in this area, might send reinforcements in response. The druidical leaders might counter with their own elemental powers and other forces of nature. Large-scale escalation is unlikely at this point in the Temple's recovery, but the appearances and effects of such develop­ ments might seem otherwise . . . . Kron Hills: Nearly 20,00 gnomes live in this area. This is known to most of those nearby, as the gnomes were instrumental in driving the humanoid hordes from the Lortmil Mountains adjacent to the southwest, as well as in the overthrow of the Temple a decade ago. The enclaves and territories of the gnomes should not be invaded, but other caves and ruins aplenty lie scattered in the region. This is a natural setting for some other small dungeon of your own design, which can be tailored to challenge the party's resources while remaining within their capabilities. Velverdyva: The natural flow of the river is eastward, from the lower Yatil mountains and the Clatspur range southward through Veluna, past Verbobonc and quite near Nulb (fed by the Imeryds Run), and continuing through the Gnarley Forest into the great Nyr Dyv, Lake of Unknown Depths. One of its sources is in the far northern Burneal For­ est, in the land of Blackmoor itself! And where the water flows, creatures follow. A simple boating jaunt, either upstream or down, can encounter river pirates and sundry random aquatic encounters (fresh­ water only, of course). Low-level characters should be discouraged from such endeavors to some extent, but those of level 5 and up might perhaps find other arms of the powers of Chaos and Evil lurking in the waters nearby. And who knows what things-or even kingdoms-lurk in the depths Verbobonc: The obvious source of new adventurers to replace those lost, this city also offers more and better equipment, a greater scope of information, and so forth. The spies of the rising Temple are here also, and will fol­ low those who sem to be on their mistress's trail. As this is a city of 11,60 and the capital of the Viscounty (total pop. 35,00), considera­ ble design time is required for full details. Small portions-the palace of Viscount Wilfrick, City Hall and the Mayor's residence, Guild halls, strongholds of the nearby gnomes and elves, etc.-may suffice, if accompanied by general street descriptions and a broad selection of random encounters. 0R,jGi ilAL ADVEil'fVRJ:S REi ilCAR_IlA'fED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEilTAL EVIL Part 1 : The Village of Hommlet PLAYERS' DESCRIPTION Your party is now approaching the Village of Hommlet, having ridden up from lands of the Wild Coast. You are poorly mounted, badly equipped, and have no large sums of cash. In fact, all you have is what you wear and what you ride, plus the few coins that are hidden in purses and pockets. What you do poses in quantity, though, is daring and desire to become wealthy and famous. Thus your group comes to Hommlet to learn. Is this indeed a place for adventurers to sek their for­ tunes? You all hope, of course, to gain riches and make names for yourselves. The outcome of this is uncertain, but your skill and daring, along with a good measure of luck, will be the main ingredients of what follows, be it for weal or woe. The small community at the crossroads is a completely unknown quantity. What is there? Who will be encountered? Where should you go 7 These are your first explo­ rations and encounters, so chance may dic­ tate as much as intelligence. Will outsiders be shunned? Are the reports true-is the whole community engaged in evil prac­ tices? Are the folk here bumpkins, easily duped? Does a curse lay upon those who dare to venture into the lands which were once the Temple's? All of these questions will soon be answered. The dusty, rutted road is lined with closely-grown hedges of brambles and shrubs. Here and there it cuts through a copse or crosses a rivulet. To either hand, forest and meadow have given way to field and orchard. A small herd of kine graze nearby, and a distant hill is dotted with the wand stone chimneys with thin plumes of blue smoke rising from them. A road angles west into the hill country, and to either side of the road ahead are barns and buildings-Hommlet at last! The adventure begins . . . Key to the Village 1. PROSPEROUS FARM COTTAGE AND LARGE BARN This wood and plaster house is well­ kept, and the barn beyond is bulging with hay, grain, and so forth. Several fat animals are about. Two large farm dogs bark at your approach, and a rosy-cheeked goodwife appears at the doorway. The large goodwife is friendly, greeting all who call, while her four children look on. Inside, a young girl and her old granny do var­ ious chores. The lintel over the front door is carved with acorns and oak leaves. If politely asked, any adult in the family will state that the family is of the Old Faith (i.e. druidicai). The head of the house and his two full­ grown sons are at work in the nearby fields. These three are members of the town mili­ tia. The elder has a bill-guisarme and a ring mail jack, while his sons have leather armor and shield and wield a flail and an axe (respectively). Each has a dagger at all times. They take arms only in self-defense or when called up by the village elder. The two farm dogs will attack intruders if their master or his family are attacked or even visibly threatened.

Other than feed grain or hay, the farmer has nothing to sell or trade. The farmer has 57 pp hidden in his mat­ tress and a blue spine) (worth 500 gp) secured in his pouch, saved for hard times. 2. MODEST FARMHOUSE AND BARN Clean but slightly run-down buildings indicate that this farm is not very pros­ perous. However, the stock appears quite healthy and plump. An active lad of 12 or so is doing chores. Nothing appears of particular interest. An elderly couple herein are master and mistress; the boy is a servant. These folks have nothing to trade. The elders say that their son Elmo would be interested in talk­ ing with strangers-he's at the inn having a jack of ale. Their other son, Otis (they sadly shake their heads), took service with some gentlemen and is away seeking his fortune. Elmo is strong, but not loo quick, and is 7 overfond of brew. The elderly farmer is a retired fighter still somewhat in practice, equivalent to level 4. He owns a suit of scale mail, a shield, long­ sword, and a light crossbow, all kept in a chest in the front room. He is, in fact, cap­ tain of the local militia, though he will say nothing of it. Fanner: AC 5 (if prepared); Level 4 Fighter; hp 16; #AT 1; D 1-8 (sword) or 1-4 (crossbow, ranges 6 "/12 "/18"); XP 214; S 15 I 12 W 16 D 12 Co 16 Ch 11 Servant: AC 9 (shield); Level O; hp 4; #AT l; D 1-6 (club); XP 14 Underneath some rusty nails in a keg in the back shed are 172 ep, 51 gp, and 20 pp. A cupboard in the house holds a silver service worth 1,300 gp. Elmo may (50% chance) return while the party is here, and may otherwise (25 % ) be encountered on the road after the characters depart. He will otherwise be encountered at the Inn. Elmo will reveal his status (man-at-arms) to any who ask. While in town 'carousing', he is unarmored but carries (as always) his dagger + 2. If asked about it, he proudly proclaims "My brudder Otis gave it to me!" Elmo's speech is slow and halting. He often appears tipsy and jovial, frequenting the Inn of the Welcome Wench much of the time. He will state his interest-money (obviously to be used for ale purchases)­ and will work as a hireling, gladly accompa­ nying any who ask providing they furnish him with "chain armor and a BIG axe:· Elmo only pretends his inebriation; he is a 4th level ranger, and an agent of the Viscount of Verbobonc. His town visits are for the pur­ pose of observing newcomers, to insinuate himself in their expeditions. If employed, he dons his own mail (se below) in place of that given (or under a lighter type), and uses his own magical battle axe as well. Elmo's valuables are hidden in a lead­ lined oaken chest buried in the dirt floor of the barn: chain mail + 1, shield + 2, battle axe + 1, 100 sp, 50 gp, 10 pp, and and small pearls worth 100 gp each. The lead will foil all attempts at magical detection. He also owns a longbow with two score arrows, half of them silver-tipped, though he does not bring this weapon on adventures. 0RJGiIIAL ADVEIITVRJ:S REi IICAR.IIATED • THE TEJlIPLE 0F ELEJlIEllTAL EVIL Elmo: AC 1 (equipped) or 8; Level 4 Ranger (HD 5); hp 41; #AT l; D 5-12 (battle axe) or 6-9 (dagger) each including magic and strength bonuses); XP 375 S 18/43 I 15 W 16 D 16 Co 17 Ch 11 If anything untoward befalls Elmo, his brother Otis will eventually hear of it and seek redress.

He has nothing of interest to charac­ ters, and is not interested in adventuring. He keeps his leather armor, battle axe, and heavy crossbow (with 30 quarrels) in a chest in the bedroom. He is of the Old Faith, and will report anything unusual to the druid (area 24). In a pouch under the floorboards of his cottage are 38 cp, 17 sp, 13 ep, and 9 gp. Woodcutter: AC 8 (leather); Level O; hp 6; #AT l; D 1-8 (battle axe) or 2-5 (cross­ bow, ranges 8 "/16 "/24 "); XP 20 4. WELL-KEPT FARM The house and barn show that this farmer is doing well, and the stock in the fenced-in yard are very fine-looking. You see a fetching feminine face in a window. A widow and her two grown sons (mem­ bers of the Militia) dwell here, the latter with their wives and eight children. They are interested in neither trade nor adventur­ ing. These folk are all of the Old Faith. In a large iron pot buried beneath the tree in the back yard are 421 sp and 97 gp. Sons (2): AC 8; Level O; hp 4 each; #AT l; D 1-6 (hand axe or club); XP 14 each s. PROSPEROUS FARMHOUSE This farmer is a widower of middle age with the trying task of raising five children, the two eldest being teen-aged daughters. A manservant laborer helps with the chores. The farmer is the brother of the farmer to the south (area 1) and is quite distant and taciturn. He turns folk away unless they have farm business. He keeps his leather armor neatly hung near the front door. Both of the men are militiamen. Inside a crock in the manure pile are hid­ den 55 gp, 37 pp, and three zircons worth 50 gp each. The farmer carries 8 cp, 22 sp, 15 gp, and 8 pp in his purse. Farmer: AC 7 (if prepared); Level O; hp 3; #AT l; D 1-8 (sword); XP 13 Manservant: AC 10; Level O; hp 6; #AT l; D 2-8 (voulge); XP 16 6. HOUSE WITH LEATHER HIDE TACKED TO FRONT DOOR This is the home and business of the vil­ lage leatherworker and his wife, her brother (a simpleton who does not bear arms), and three children, the eldest of whom is a 12- year-old boy. The leatherworker is a 'jack of all trades', being shoemaker, bootmaker, cobbler, saddler, harnessmaker, and even fashioner of leather garments and armor, the latter requiring some time and a number of fittings and boiling. He is not interested in any sort of adventuring, but is a militiaman, as is the boy. Sewn into an old horse collar are 27 gp, 40 ep, and a silver necklace worth 400 gp. Leatherworker: AC 7 (leather & shield); Level 0, hp 2; #AT 1, D 1-4 (sling) or 1-6 (axe); XP 16 Eldest son: AC 8 (leather jack); Level O; hp 2; #AT l; D 1-4 (sling or dagger); XP 16 7. LARGE BUILDING WITH SIGN The square wooden sign shows a buxom and smiling girl holding a flagon of beer. This must be the Inn of the Welcome Wench, a place renowned for its good food and excellent drink! Passing mer­ chants make a point of stopping, as do many other sorts of wayfarers, and it is said that the place is always filled with patrons. The three levels of this place are shown on Map 3, and the building is described in detail under 'The Inn of the Welcome Wench:' A young stableboy and a groom handle the draft and riding animals, and themselves live in the stables. The innkeeper is Ostler Gundi­ goot, always found bustling about the place 8 along with his goodwife, their two daughters, a serving wench or two, and a pair of potboy apprentices. Several customers (4-16) are in the main room most of the time. The host talks freely but says little. He has a sharp eye and a good sense for judging character. He serves all comers, and will rent a room to anyone who is not causing trouble. Ostler is the sergeant of the militia, and the stableboy and groom are also members. The first potboy is an aspiring druid, and he serves as the courier to the druid of the grove, bearing messages of interesting data to him.

OPEN SHED AND HOUSE BEHIND Horseshoes are nailed to three faces of the post in front of this shed, and within sit a forge and bellows. This is obviously the smithy. A short but brawny man is vigorously pounding away at a piece of red-hot iron. The smith is obviously hard-working, forthright, and likeable. He is able to do all sorts of metalwork, even fashioning iron and steel weapon heads, helmets, and shields. He will readily admit that he is not capable of fine armoring. 'Brother Smyth' is the assistant to the druid of the grove. Though he will never work up very high because of his occupa­ tion, he will assume the role of religious advisor to the faithful. He has a small chest filled with 82 cp and 28 sp. The rest of his wealth he gives to the good work for the needy. In no event will he leave his fireside to go adventuring.

NEW BUILDING There is no one here. The doors are unlocked, and a few benches and stools stand by the bare walls, with a large, plain table at the far end of the room. A tapestry on the back wall shows a green field with two acorns above a sheaf of grain-the banner of Hommlet. This is the village hall recently con­ structed for feasts and councils by Burne and Rufus (q. v. area 31). IO. WELL-KEPT DWELLING WITH A SIGN The wooden sign depicts a bag of wool and a loom. Herein dwells the elderly weaver and his wife, their daughter, and her husband. Four young apprentices are also here, as business is very good. There are bolts of woolen and flaxen cloth here, but nothing else of possible interest. These folk are Lawful Neutral followers of St. Cuthbert (see area 20). They moved to the area only two years ago. The weaver has a cache of 7 small gold ingots (24 gp each) and a gold pin (200 gp) with an amethyst (100 gp) behind a loose stone in the fire­ place.

COITAGE Here lives a small and mild tailor, a bach­ elor of thirty years or so. He is an expert at making or repairing garments. He has just moved to the village, but has not been invited to join the militia due to his small size. He has thus practiced at weapons to prove himself useful. He has become expert at throwing a knife and shooting a crossbow, attacking with either as if a 7th level fighter and gaining a + 2 damage bonus. He also knows the dwarven, elven, and halfling tongues, in addition to Com­ mon. The tailor has only 19 sp in a false bottom of his thread box. He is a follower of St. Cuthbert.

AVERAGE FARM BUILDING This place is the home of a strapping farmer and his equally large son, the farmer's wife, and six daughters-one of whom has a small child. They are friendly but have nothing of interest to adventurers. These folk are of the Old Faith and have lived here all of their lives. The farmer and his son are both militiamen. A clay pot filled with dried flowers hides 36 gp and a gold ring worth 150 gp.

WOODEN BUILDING WITH SHUT­ TERED WINDOWS (Trading Post) Outside the door, a shield and lantern are suspended from chains. The shield is painted, showing a sword and a cheese. This is the local trading post, wherein a merchant apparently provides for the needs of villagers, travellers and adven­ turers alike. Refer to Map 4 for a floor plan. See Area 13 for a detailed room key. The shop is run by one Rannos Davi, who is best described as slow, fat, clumsy and placid. His partner Gremag is tall and thin, with sharp features and protruding eyes. Gremag tends to dither and fuss at cus­ tomers, and at Rannos as well. The whole front building is filled with various goods. The barn has animals, saddles, and the like available to any willing to pay the price. Both traders claim disinterest in all alignments, proclaiming that they hap­ pily deal with anyone who is a paying customer. Furthermore, they say, they will gladly buy any items which you happen upon, and pay a fair price too! In the rear barn are various animals for sale-mules, draft horses, light riding horses, ponies (2-5 of-each type), and one medium war horse. Small mounts sold can be restocked in 7-12 days from passing dealers. 9 If war horses are desired, it will take 7-30 days to obtain 1-2 heavy or 1-3 medium or light steeds, with a maximum of four such animals obtainable in any 30 day period. These nefarious traders sell all items at a minimum of 110% of the price given in the book asking more first. For an item brought in, if in good condition, they offer 25 % of its worth, but can be bartered up to 40-70%. A groom and a man-at-arms working here will hire out, at the rate of 2 gp per day and only if the characters buy chain mail armor here, for their use (and only if one of the traders specifically approves.) Both men serve in the militia, spying for the shop­ keepers. Ramos and Gremag are naturally desir­ ous of having their agent accompany the party. If the group does not hire one, the traders will keep close track of their activi­ ties by any means possible, including fol­ lowing them personally if the situation warrants it (i.e. if they know that the party has been particularly successful). For such missions, a stock of magical devices hidden away will be brought out for use. Rannos Davi is chaotic, evil, and highly suspicious. Gremag is as evil and even more chaotic. Both are servants of the Temple of Elemental Evil, who report activity in Hom­ mlet to a brigand courier. They aid any and all other evil creatures who come in Temple service.

WEATHERBEATEN BUILDING AND BARN A wooden sign shows a cart and horse, indicating that this is the domicile and quar­ ters of the local carter. This teamster, his wife, a grown son, and five other children live in the house. The attached barn has two wagons and two carts below, and two driv­ ers live in the loft. The smallish barn to the rear houses a dozen mules. This fellow and his associates are dour, but will gladly accept hire. The teamster, his son, and the two drivers are all militiamen. Another newcomer and advocate of St. Cuthbert, the teamster is -very honest. He dislikes the traders, but isn't sure why, and will take time to speak of it if the questioner is careful and also a customer. Having lost a wagon and team lately, the fellow has only 19 sp hidden under a loose floor board.

STURDY NEW BUILDING WITH A SIGN The sign displays three yellow balls; this must be the moneychanger's. A guard in chain mail stands by the door, wearing a sword and cradling a light crossbow in his arms, with a quarrel ready. Two large dogs are sniffing in your direction. The proprietor is Nira Melubb. He will happily exchange coins and metal for other media, charging only 10% of the value. Nira also deals inpaying S0-80% of actual value and selling for 102-120% above actual value. He also makes jewelry, for a fee of double the value of the materials. (This is also the value of new jewelry.) Nira asks no questions and is always obliging and polite. Melubb is truly neutral. Though the rise of evil is not desired by him (as it would hurt business), he has no other interest in events. He keeps a dagger + 1 in his boot and a sword + 1 under the counter. His cash box holds 200 cp, 200 sp, 200 ep, and 200 gp. A small iron box nearby contains SO pp, 12 pieces of lovely but clear quartz (worth S gp each), two citrines, three moonstones, and a piece of onyx (the latter six gems worth SO gp each). In the living quarters of the establishment is an oaken chest. A poisoned needle trap is in the lock; furthermore, if the top is opened, acid sprays out in front (10 foot range), inflicting S-20 points of damage to each victim in the area (save for 112 dam­ age, but save for items as well). A trick catch on the back of the chest allows safe entry. Inside are 1,000 cp, 1,000 sp, 1,000 ep, SOO gp, 200 pp, nine amethysts (100 gp each), two large pearls (SOO gp each), one slightly flawed diamond (1,000 gp), and seven pieces of jewelry (valued at 900, 1100, 1600, 200, 2SOO, 4000, and 600 gp each). The bottom of the chest lifts, revealing SO gold ingots worth 100 gp each. Be sure to keep track of all transactions made. The stock in trade must be correct; for example, gems cannot be obtained when Nira has exhausted his supply. He can pur­ chase more from merchants, at market value, every 7-12 days.

SMALL HOUSE WITH SIGN The nicely painted sign shows a painted shield and a chest of drawers. This building is the shop and home of the local cabinet maker, his wife, and two young children. He has an apprentice who does most of the rough work, while he crafts the fine work and the limning. He is quite adept at shield designs and sign work, and can make almost any sort of furniture. The cabinet maker will happily do commis­ sioned work of any sort, but he is not inter­ ested in adventuring, of course, nor is his apprentice. The folk here follow the Old Faith. The 10 cabinet maker and his apprentice are both militiamen. A small cache of 18 pp, 21 gp, and 30 ep is kept under a rock near the back door.

He has a variety of earthenware bottles and flasks available for sale. The potter, his wife, and four children all work in the business. The potter and his two eldest sons are militiamen. A crock hidden in the well holds 40 sp, 27 gp, and six agates (three banded and three mossy) worth 10 gp each. The family is of the congregation of St. Cuthbert.

TYPICAL COTTAGE AND IMPOS­ ING STONE BUILDING WITH A BARREL HANDING FROM CHAINS This house is the home of the local braumeister and his wife and young child. A nephew and his wife have recently come to help run the affair, as it is very successful. At night, a large dog runs free in the house. The brew house has a cellar for aging. Several vats are on the main floor, and the side sheds hold ingredients. Three appren­ tice brewers dwell in the brewhouse attic. The family members are all of the Old Faith, as are two of the apprentices. The third is a recent convert to the faith of St. Cuthbert. The apprentices brew the various ales and beers under the direction of the Braumeister, and can drink almost anyone (except the 0NGirn.L A.DVEilTV'S REiilCAR_IlATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EilTA.L EVIL master and his nephew) under the table. The apprentices, the braumeister, and his nephew are all militiamen. The family owns a dinner service of ster­ ling silver (worth 6,000 gp) and a gold decanter (worth 1,250 gp). A small iron cof­ fer hidden in an upper closet contains 73 pp, three huge white pearls (500 gp each), and three pieces of jewelry (500, 100, and 1800 gp). The apprentices own only a few cop­ pers among them.

MODEST COTTAGE Three dogs guard this, the home of the grizzled herdsman Black Jay, and his flock. The herdsman does not like company or strangers, and says so to any who come onto his property. This retired warrior is friendly with the elves to the northwest, but will not partake of any adventuring. His house was raided, and his wife and children slain, when he was away in the wars. His possessions are few; he has only his armor and weapons, a few coins in his purse (20 cp, 19 sp, 8 ep, 11 gp, and 4 pp), an old jar in his cupboard, and a few magic items-10 arrows + 1, elven boots, and an elven cloak.

CHURCH Of ST. CUTHBERT This newly built edifice was raised by the viscount, in honor of the aid rendered to him by the Archcleric of Veluna during the war against the Temple of Elemental Evil. A somewhat distant cleric and his assistant officiate during services and otherwise serve their flock. Other than at services, anyone coming to the church must deal with the lesser cleric, the priest Calmert. Holy water can only be obtained here or from the trader (area 13, who purveys plain water as holy). The honest Calmert is known for his zeal in obtaining contributions. He is anxious to give a sum to the builders of the fortress under construction. Though it should seem otherwise, most of the miscellaneous money he collects 'for the church' will go towards building the castle! The Canon Terjon (who owns rings of invisibility and mammal contra[) recently became the chief cleric of the church, taking over from the Canoness Y'dey, who left unexpectedly and has not returned. The vil­ lagers say that Terjon is not particularly friendly and his stern demeanor is a cause of some speculation. Detailed information on the Canoness Y'dey is given in the Nulb encounter key (Area 3). For more information on the church, see Map 5 and the detailed room key of Area 20.

COTTAGE AND LARGE BARN These well-kept buildings are obviously those of a cowherd, and a particular odor is quite noticeable in the area. The farmer, his wife, his aged mother, and seven children have a dairy, making and selling cheese. The trader and the inn take what does not sell to passing merchants, so very little is available to individual purchasers. 11 The farmer and his three eldest sons are militiamen. The family is part of the congre­ gation of St. Cuthbert. Under the floor of the cheese storage shed is a sack containing 189 cp and 42 sp.

MILL AND ATTACHED HOME Here dwell Mytch, his wife, three chil­ dren, and two servants. They grind grain into flour, of course, and goodwife miller also does some bread baking for the village. A large dog is kept inside the millhouse. These folk are of the Old Faith, pillars of the community, and tend to be cool toward strangers-suspicious with good cause. Mytch and one of the servants are militia­ men. The miller has saved a store of gems (two chrysoberls, two spinels, five garnets and a tourmaline, each worth 100 gp), and keeps them in a hidden niche within an old millstone.

COTTAGE AND SMALL BARN A somewhat reclusive farmer, his spinster daughter and son dwell here. They are not particularly successful at farming, but are excellent fishers, trappers and hunters. The villagers are not particularly fond of these folk. The farmer and his son are militiamen. The spinster daughter is only in her twen­ ties, and is handsome but bossy. These peo­ ple do not follow any religious persuasion, so they are excluded from most village func­ tions. They have saved 73 sp in a hollow of a tree to the north. 0NGi ilAL ADVEilTVRJ:S REiilCAR_IlATED • THE TEltcPLE 0F ELEltcEllTAL EVIL Farmer: AC 8 (padded armor); Level O; hp 3; #AT 1; D 1-8 (fauchard-fork); XP 13 Daughter: AC 10; Level 1 Fighter; hp 8; #AT l; D 1-4 (dagger) or 2-5 (sling bullet); XP 22 Son: AC 8 (padded armor); Level O; hp 5; #AT l; D 1-6 (staff) or 2-5 (sling bullet); XP 19 24. THE GROVE This is obviously a place of worship. The trees are neatly pruned, and the grass is well tended. A carefully placed line of bluish stones sets off the path leading to a rock cairn where flowers, nuts, berries, and garlands of leaves are placed. A small path leads beyond the shrine to a low-roofed wooden building placed under the great boughs of the central oaks of the copse. A call will bring forth the druid, Jaroo Ashstaff. All comers to the Grove are expected to make an offering here and there (and the druid will remind them, if neces­ sary). If the visitors are not of the Old Faith, they are expected to give several gold pieces to Jaroo as donations towards the needy of Hommlet. The druid will listen to requests for assistance from those who contribute. Jaroo is an agent of the druids of Gnarley Wood, sent to Hommlet to see if the Temple of Elemental Evil is totally destroyed, and to help repress any rise of evil of that sort. He will give aid by spells, but will not accom­ pany a party. If the visitors are suspicious sorts, Jaroo will follow at a distance to see what goes on. He has a huge black bear, which is always nearby but out of sight 95 % of the time. Hidden in his cottage are a scroll of 1 spell (weather summoning), a potion of invulner­ ability, and a decanter of endless water. Stored in a stone box beneath the floor of the root cellar are 42 gems worth a total of 16,380 gp (seven moss agates, one ame­ thyst, three bloodstones, two carnelians, two citrines, five black opals, three blue opals, two fire opals, two black pearls, two white pearls, four sapphires, one topaz, six turquoise, and two zircons).

LARGE BARN AND CONNECTED HOME This place is obviously that of a herds­ man. His wife is dead, but a full grown son and his wife care for the five children. A cousin helps to tend the flocks, and he has brought two dogs along. These folk are friendly, but are not interested in adventure and have little interest in the way of goods. They all follow the Old Faith. The herdsman, his son, and his cousin are all militiamen.

The artisan, his small child, and two helpers live in the side apartment. His wife is dead, and his helpers are his nephews. All the men are in the militia. These folk are followers of St. Cuthbert. The elder tends to drink too much, but is good­ hearted. He has 140 sp set aside for his little daughter's dowry, the sum being kept in a pouch hanging in a back closet.

WALLED MANOR HOUSE This place has an eight foot high stone wall and a heavy gate. It is obviously the residence of some well-to-do folk, and easily defensible in times of trouble. This is the home of the village elder, his wife, and their four grown sons. Two of the sons are married, and their wives and three children live here also. The elder is a retired farmer, and his sons now care for the fields and livestock. All of his sons have horses, and are very proud of their status. Two ser­ vant girls and a hired farmhand are quar­ tered in the stable loft. All the inhabitants are of the Old Faith. The four sons and the hired hand are mem­ bers of the militia. In the event of attack vil­ lagers nearby seek safety in this compound. The elder is quite wise and greatly respected. He heads a council whose other members (in order of seniority) are- Jaroo, the druid of the Grove (24) Terjon, chief cleric of the church (20) Elmo's father, Captain of the militia (2) Ostler, the Innkeeper (7) Mytch, the Miller (22) Burne, the magic-user (31) Rufus, Burne's associate (31) 0NGiilAL A.DVEil'fV'S REiilCARJIA'fED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EilTA.L EVI L The latter two are new arrivals to the council.

In a secret compartment in the bedroom is an iron box which contains 428 gp, 10 pp, and four pieces of jewelry (worth 400, 900, 2000, and 5000 gp). His silver dinnerware is valued at 3,750 gp, and the several gold dishes are worth a total of 2,300 gp. The elder and his sons each carry about 10 gp worth of various coins in their purses.

This new home is the shop and residence of the local carpenter, his wife, and his younger brother. The carpenter often works for other craftsmen in town, and is cur­ rently at work on barrel staves. As is typical of most townsfolk, he is too busy to think of adventuring. Having come to the village about two years ago, this family is considered 'outside' folk, and will be until their beards grow gray. The carpenter and his brother are nev­ ertheless militiamen. All three are followers of St. Cuthbert. The woman owns a silver chain with 12 silver coins (worth 25 gp).

STONE HOUSE This well-crafted stone dwelling seems recently built. It is set off from the road by a low stone wall. No animals are seen, but some children are playing in the yard. The stonemason, another of the recent newcomers to Hommlet, built this home. His wife and two children are here, but he and his three apprentices are at work building the new castle on the low hillocks to the southeast (area 31). These folks are of the Old Faith. The mason and his apprentices are militiamen . The mason has offered to help with the working of several large monoliths for the. Grove after the castle is finished. The mason is well-regarded in Hommlet. He has become quite friendly with the magic-user, Burne. He has 20 gold ingots (worth 50 gp each) hidden in a secret hollow under the stone wall out front.

DOUBLE FIELDSTONE WALLS FILLED WITH EARTH Here are the beginnings of a smallish cas­ tle, being built around a new tower atop the low mound. Workers have dug deep trench lines about ten feet wide and as deep, down to a hard clay. They seem to be in the proc­ ess of mortaring the foundations of the wall to be built above. Work has barely begun, but the outlines of bastions, towers, a gate­ house and a keep can be noted. The keep is atop the second hillock, and considerable excavation has taken place. The earth from this digging has been used in the walls around the whole. Some dressed stone blocks are visible, but not similar to local stone. The whole is being financed by the Vis­ count and the Archcleric of Veluna, for favors done by the owners of the tower (which they also built), Burne and Rufus. These two will, in tum, serve the Viscount by holding the area safe for him and report­ ing on any untoward happenings. 13 31. TWO-STORIED TOWER This structure is some 55 feet tall, a smaller tower rising inside the greater at about 35 feet above the ground. Its entrance is accessible only by going up a curving flight of stone stairs which termi­ nate in a landing about 10 feet above the ground. The outer door of the tower lowers to form a bridge to the stone land­ ing. There are numbers of arrow slits around the tower, and it has a splay around the base to about 6 feet in height. The lower and upper battlements are machicolated, the merlons being pierced for archery as well. Two men-at-arms watch from its roof. See Map 6 for a floor plan, and refer to Area 31 for a detailed room key. Inside dwell Rufus the Fighter and Burne the magic-user. Both came to Hommlet some three years ago, and had considerable success in adventuring. They defeated a large bandit force which had plagued Verbo­ bonc, and it is rumored that they gained considerable treasure in killing a green dragon which preyed in the Kron Hills to the west. These two are friends of all the important folk in the village. It is well known that they are tough and very cautious, but willing to give some aid to adventurers for a price. 0NGiIIAL A.DVEII'fVRJ:S REiIICAR._IIAfED • THE TEJkl:PLE 0F ELEJkl:EIITA.L EVIL All sorts of standard equipment is stored in the keep, and both Burne and Rufus have odd potions and scrolls as well . Burne, 'His Most Worshipful Mage of Hommlet': The magic-user is Lawful Good, clever, but a trifle on the greedy side. All services he renders will be paid for hand­ somely. He is a follower of St. Cuthbert, and very conscious of his duty to protect the village and to watch for evil. His adventur­ ing (if any) will be calculated to accomplish those ends and gain him a third of the trea­ sure found as well. He is not likely to risk his life or be duped. Burne is on the young side for a magic-user, average in appearance and dress, and will often frequent the Inn of the Welcome Wench. Rufus: The fighter is also Lawful Good. When he reaches 8th level, he is to return to Verbobonc for special service on the Vis­ count's behalf. He will not risk his life nor become involved in foolish adventures. If he renders service to a party, he requires not less than 20% of the total treasure gained. Rufus leads a squad of men-at-arms, and has been appointed as the overall com­ mander of the village troops as well.

TENTS AND WATTLE HUTS Some dozen temporary shelters are along the edge of this copse of trees. They house ten peasant laborers and associated train­ women, children, stray dogs, etc. They are the workers constructing the new castle. A few villagers also work on the project from time to time; each puts in half a day's labor once per week. Whenever a load of materials is sent from Verbobonc, six new laborers arrive with it, and a like number then return to that town with the empty wagons. One of the laborers is an agent evil, spy­ ing on this activity for the traders (area 13). He secretly meets with them to give reports as needed. After the tower is complete, he is expected to work for the traders as a guard, in garb that will probably leave his duplicity undetected.

OVERGROWN TRACK This leads off into the rugged hills and tangled scrub above the town. About a league away (2-3 miles) is a ruined moat house, a former warning post for the destroyed Temple.

THE INN OF THE WELCOME WENCH Menu and Prices The cost of food and drink at the Wel­ come Wench is higher than usual. It is the only inn for many miles, the place is 14 renowned and its food better than average, and the area is prosperous. Choice venison, mutton, poached salmon, trout stuffed with specially prepared mixtures, goose roasted to a golden brown, pork, steaming sau­ sages, steak and kidney pie with mush­ rooms or truffles, squab stuffed pheasant, and boiled crayfish in drawn butter are just a few of the epicurian delights which are expected and served here. The locally brewed ale and beer is supplemented by brews from other sites, and wine, mead and brandy from all over the Flanaess make their way to the boards of the Welcome Wench. Meals are served on pottery, pewter, or copper services, according to the order. Var­ ious leather jacks, pottery mugs, wooden tankards, pewter steins, glass flagons, crys­ tal goblets, or silver chalices are used for potables.

Il.A.'fED • THE TEJl:cPLE 0F ELEJl:cEilTAL EVIL Rooms The upper rooms are very clean, and all except the common dormitory are heated. Each has a fine bed, many covers, wash stand, chamber pot, towels, pegs for gar­ ments, and several chairs and stools. The larger rooms have arm chairs, tables, foot­ stools, bed warmers, curtained beds, and good rugs on the floor and wall hangings as well. The cost of each is shown in the key to the second floor. FIRST FLOOR I 1. Common Room This large place is bright and cheerful. It contains several rough-hewn tables and chairs, boards, and benches. Natural tree trunk pillars support the ceiling overhead, all dark with smoke and age. A motley group of people is here. In the daytime, half of the 4-16 customers in the place are travelers (merchants, tin­ kers, peddlers, etc.), and half are local folk. In the evening, double the number rolled, with a 50% chance that the NPCs who have chambers above (areas l, 5, and 9) are in the common room. Roll for each NPC once per hour. Several barmaids and potboys circu­ late, bringing viands and drink, taking away the empty plates and flagons, stoking the fire if the day is chill, and so forth. I 2. Private Room This chamber is for visiting noblemen, rich merchants, and the like. It contains a long table and comfortable side chairs. It is also used by those wishing to have a private meal. It is nicely furnished, with tapestries and paintings on the walls. I 3. Private Room This place is generally kept aside by Ostler Gundigoot for those of his patrons who wish privacy to confer, game, or what­ ever. It is in a dark and inconspicuous cor­ ner. A secret door, a press and slide upwards panel, gives way to a narrow stone staircase leading down to a secret room in the cellar. This place was used extensively during the time of trouble with the Temple of Elemental Evil, but is now in disuse, and few of the vil­ lage folk know of it. I 4. Bar This is the proprietor's usual station. He sees to the filling of jacks of ale, tankards of beer, and flagons of wine. Boiled eggs, cheeses, and hard biscuits or crackers are often atop the trestle. Serving girls carry the food from here to the common room. There are great barrels of ale and beer, tuns of wine, and a cask of brandy with spigots ready at the host's hand. A box under the bar holds 61 cp, 33 sp, 17 ep, 47 gp, and 11 pp in separate compartments. This ready money is taken upstairs each night. Gundi­ goot keeps about 100 gp worth of various coins in his apron pockets. I 5. Kitchen The huge fireplace usually has various pots and kettles within, a roast turning, and several fowl kept warm in its side places. Goodwife Gundigoot is in charge here, keeping cook and scullions hopping. At the west end are the steps leading down to the cellar and up to the private apartment of the owner. UPPER FLOOR I 6. Private Room This chamber is rented by Zert, a fighter who is ostensibly awaiting the return of a caravan from the south, but who is actually a Chaotic Evil spy for the Temple. The trad­ ers (area 13) know who and what Zert really is, but he does not know that they are also pawns of Evil. Zert will happily go with adventurers for an equal share of treasure. He will as readily betray them, help to slay them, and take their goods. He has double the capacity of an ordinary man, able to drink ·great quantities without becoming drunk. He carries 20 gp in his purse. His medium warhorse and lance are in the sta­ ble. Saddlebags on the table herein hold other garments. A pouch in plain view holds 27 sp, 12 ep, and 40 gp. Hidden in a locked coffer under some of his clothing are 265 gp, 100 pp, and 10 pearls, each black but flawed (worth 100 gp .each, but seeming 5 to 10 times that value to the unskilled or casual observer).

I 10. Private Room This place is currently the lodgings of Spugnoir, an Evoker. He came into the vil­ lage with a merchant wagon, and is staying in hopes of gathering spells, for he knows only detect magic, read magic, and sleep. A large trunk holds his clothing, professional paraphernalia, and a fair assortment of dungeon exploration materials (DM's choice). He has learned that a warlock was housed in the ruined moat house, and plans to quietly search it. His garb is nondescript, as he does not wish to attract attention nor be recognized as a magic-user. His funds currently amount to 7 sp, 9 gp, 11 pp, and three zircons (SO gp each). The coins are in his wallet, and the gems are secreted in the hem of his cloak. If approached, he will claim to be working for a sage, and will go with the party if offered all the scrolls found. Otherwise, he will attempt to shadow the party and glean what he can.

Private Room This comfortable room is the quarters of one Furnok of Ferd, a 'treasure finder'. He loves to gamble, in part since he knows how to nick cards and has a pair of loaded knucklebones. (This gives him a 60% prob­ ability of winning at cards, and 75 % at dice.) He is careful to play so as to not be caught cheating, and makes a modest living thus, mostly skinning passing merchants. If offered a chance to adventure, Furnok is willing to go along for an equal share (plus all he can surreptitiously lift, particularly magic items, which he covets). To show his good faith, however, he will put up a scroll of protection from magic, hoping to parlay it into far more. If the worst should come, he has a dagger + 1 hidden in his boot. Fumok's funds consist of a small hoard of 37 gems worth 50 gp each (three blood­ stones, eight carnelians, four chalcedon, four citrines, six onyx, and nine zircons), and 12 sp and 12 gp for gambling. He also has a ring of invisibility and the aforemen­ tioned scroll and dagger.

Private Room This place houses a strange pair-a hulk­ ing fighter, Kebort by name, and his associ­ ate, a small and thin fellow called Turuko, a Bakluni from unknown parts. Kebort car­ ries a longsword and dagger, and keeps his lance, flail, and battle axe in the stables with his heavy warhorse. Turuko keeps his two daggers and quarterstaff handy at all times. They currently have only 40 cp, 5 sp, and 12 gp between them. 'Something must be done soon!' says Turuko. Kobort was passing through when he fell in with the monk. Turuko convinced the huge fellow that he could make them wealthy and famous. The monk believes himself to be highly clever. His plan is to waylay and rob adventurers returning from a successful expedition to the ruined moat house, for he knows that there are monsters and treasure there. The pair will try to accompany a small party, hang back during fights, and then slay the characters when they are weak­ ened. They will otherwise spy on a large group, and attack only if it is reduced by deaths and wounds.

Dormitory Sleeping Room Here most of the lesser travelers can spend a warm and a safe night for a mere sil­ ver piece. The place has a dozen pallets, and in the morning the table in the center is loaded with hot tea and fresh loaves at no extra cost. Even these folks receive warm water and clean towels for morning ablu­ tions; such is the quality of the Welcome Wench Inn! There are always 2-12 (or more) sleeping here. I 16. Spare Room This place is rented if the inn is exception­ ally crowded, but it is normally the quarters for the potboys and scullions, for Ostler Gundigoot is a very kind master. On cold nights he will have a fire in the room, too! I 17. Serving Wenches Room Though this chamber has cots for four, two wenches currently share the room. When the season arrives, one or two likely lasses will be hired on. I 18. Gundigoot's Children's Room The host's two young daughters are quar­ tered here, under the watchful eye of Good­ wife Gundigoot. I 19. Gundigoot's Chamber In addition to bed, dresser, and armoire, Ostler Gundigoot and his wife have a small side room where accounts are kept and the riches are stored. A small secret compart­ ment in the north wall holds a locked iron box. Inside are six pieces of jewelry worth a total of 16,000 gp (1, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 thou­ sand gp), and two sacks of coins, one of gold (400) and one of platinum (100). 16 A ladder leads to the loft over this small portion of the place, and a concealed door from there leads to the attic of the Inn proper. If anyone of highly suspicious nat­ ure appears in the place, Gundigoot will get the druid of the Grove to spy upon the room concerned by means of small sliding ceiling panels. I 20. Parlor This is the living and dining area for the Gundigoot family. It has heavy furniture, polished brass pieces (candlesticks et al.), tapestries, and so forth which show com­ fortable affluence. CELLAR I 21. Storage Area Here are sacks of various stuff for the kitchen, boxes of linens, barrels of flour, and so forth. Herbs and other items are hung from the beams overhead. This section of the basement is kept warm and dry from activity in area 22. I 22. Summer Kitchen In very hot weather, cooking which can­ not be handled on an outside fire is done here. In winter, additional cooking is also done here, so the area is dry and warmer than the rest of the cellar. Scullions and menials sometimes sleep here. Various food­ stuffs are stored in cupboards, as are extra plates, platters, etc. I 23. Locked Storage A well and heavy stone wall keep this room cool, where perishable cheeses, but­ ter, meats, and such are kept. Smaller bar­ rels of ale, beer, mead, and table wine are also in this room. I 24. Locked Storage This is the wine cellar. The rarest wines and brandies in butts and tuns are along the walls. Shelving in the center holds small casks and pottery jars of the same. I 25. Main Cellar Various old furniture and unused items are stored here and there, along with empty 0NGiilAL ADVEilTVRJOS REi ilCAR,IlA'fED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEilTAL EVIL crates, hogshead and barrels, rusty tools, an old wheelbarrow, and miscellany. A large sup­ ply of cordwood is stacked to either hand just at the entry so as to assure plenty of dry fuel for the many fireplaces of the hostel. I 26. Huge Casks In addition to a number of empty kegs, barrels, hogsheads, pipes, butts, and tuns, three great casks are here. Two have dregs of wine in them, but the third is empty. A por­ tion of its side swings up to allow entry into the interior, and a hidden catch allows the far end to swing inwards if triggered by insertion of a dagger blade in the proper crack in the fieldstone wall. I 27. Ashpit The sweepings from the fireplace above are dumped down here from a chute above. They are gathered periodically for use in soap making or for fertilizer. Ashes from the other fireplaces in the inn are stored here as well, since a grinder and separator mecha­ nism are here-and without fire hazard, since the place is entirely made of stone and iron. Inadvertently discarded valuables are sometimes present. I 28. Disused Secret Room When evil held sway in the territory, this place served as the meeting room and head­ quarters of the folk opposed to the Temple. It still contains many bunks built along the walls, several tables and benches, stools, and carefully stored arms, their metal greased against rust. Held here against future bad times are: 7 battle axes 1 bardiche 2 bill-guisarmes 7 light crossbows 12 daggers 3 glaive-guisarmes 20 javelins 3 maces 2 morning stars 4 partisans 130 quarrels 8 spears 12 longswords 12 shortswords Food, clothing and bedding are easily moved to the place from the Inn. Some 10 bucklers and 17 shields are hung on the walls. Helmets and leather jacks (12 of each) are kept in a great wooden chest. The ceiling of this room is very low compared to the rest of the cellar. A false crawl space, flagged with stones and a layer of earth, is between it and the inn floor above. The room is thus nearly soundproof. AREA 13. TRADING POST Virtually all sorts of saleable goods are offered here. If it isn't listed below, include any item which seems likely to be in use by villagers or demanded commonly by dungeon explorers. Rare or unusual items can be obtained at a price and in time (and will often be spurious and faulty!). Magic items are never sold here. Limit all quanti­ ties according to the stock normal for a small village. TP 1. Clothing and Packs Peasant equipment is about 90% of list price, rounded down. Dungeoneering items are 110% of list, rounded up. TP 2. Footwear, Gloves, Belts Prices to adventurers will be 125 % of list, 80% to villagers. TP 3. Hand Tools Hammers, adzes, planes, nails, saws, etc. A file sells for 1 sp and up. A saw costs about the same as a hand axe. TP 4.

There is a 70% chance that a ring mail jack is available, 50% for a suit of scale mail, 30% for chain mail, and 10% for a suit of banded mail. All are at 150% of list price. Suits specially ordered cost 200% of list price-half in advance, waiting time 13-30 days, fit not guaranteed. (Use ld6: 1 = too small, 2-5 = fits, 6 = too large). TP 10. Tack, Harness, Wheelbarrows, Dungeon Carts Most are available at list price. Dungeon carts are at 75% of list, one to a customer! TP 11. Traders' Quarters This room is adequately furnished with two comfortable bunks, table and chairs, wall shelves and pegs, a chest of drawers, and a pair of lockers for personal gear. A small locked coffer holds 300 gp, 150 pp, 50 gems (a mix of amethysts, garnets, pearls, and tourmalines, worth 100 gp each), two potions of invisibility, a potion of speed, and a small black scarab inscribed with the glyphs TZGY. (The latter item is a pass into an area of the Temple of Elemental Evil, but there is only a 20% chance that even a sage would recognize it as such.) A portion of the outer wall is triggered to swing out at the bottom if a small board is slipped sideways. TP 12. Barn and Stables Refer also to the stable notes, village key area 13. Horses, ponies, and mules are sta­ bled here. Various small animals are also available here-mice, doves, chickens, etc. All livestock prices are 110% of list, war­ horses 120% . TP 13. Barnyard Out in the yard are 2-5 swaybacked, pot­ bellied, spavined old plugs, with a like num­ ber of vicious, cowardly mongrel dogs. These miserable creatures are for sale, at 70% of list price, as draft horses and hunt- 0R,jGiIIAL ADVEIITV'S REiIICAR_IIATED • THE TEDrPLE 0F ELEDrEfiTAL EVI L ing dogs. The horses are 50% likely to stop Œach turn to rest, and if pushed by hard rid­ ing or a heavy load, 50% likely to die (check every turn). The dogs bite and snap at han­ dlers at every opportunity, and they will certainly run away (and return to the trad­ ers) as soon as they are not tied fast. Natu­ rally, the traders will claim that it is a case of caveat em(>tor, or that the dog is absolutely another which resembles the one purchased only superficially (perhaps adding a spot of dye to alter its appearance). AREA 20. CHURCH OF ST. CUTHBERT MAIN FLOOR C 1. Hall This is where the faithful come to hear the sermon given on Godsday eve. The place is floored in well-polished wood, with wooden ceiling and pillars extending all the way to the roof high overhead. The walls are painted in pastoral scenes, and tinted glass mosaic windows of many shades of color allow light into the hall. There are no benches, pews or stools. C 2. Processional Worshipers, as well as those to be con­ firmed, married, and so forth, are allowed to enter this way, led by the cleric or clerics concerned, the latter robed and with thuri­ ble and ceremonial billet of bronzewood. The floor here is of lighter wood, and the walls are deep blue, sprinkled with star­ bursts in silver leaf. C 3. Altar and Sanctuary The circular chamber is screened by a drape of deep green velvet. Inside is a life­ sized statue of St. Cuthbert, smiling, the great cudgel held high in one hand while the left hand beckons the doubter and the faith­ ful alike. Growing ferns and other plants are behind this statue, while to either side are tree stumps from which the clerics officiate. An altar is carved from a single piece of bronzewood with billets, star bursts, and the sacred sign of the Crumpled Hat. The walls are wainscotted with carved panels, and the painted walls show various marvels performed by St. Cuthbert. A band of holy sayings is above the walls and wood; if one of the faithful needs guidance or advice, small sticks are tossed upon the altar, and their confirmation enables the cleric to select which holy saying (or combi­ nation) applies. Examples include: Square comers can be pounded smooth. Thick heads are not made of glass. Salva­ tion is better than smart answers. Some good folk can understand only one thing. Enlightment can penetrate even the helm of iron. Evil which cannot be removed must be elim­ inated. Foolishness can be beaten. LawǏ correctiœn lies in a stout billet. Capri­ aous behavior brings knots to the heads of those lacking wisdom. Preach quietly, but have a large cudgel handy. C 4. Study and Audience Chamber Those entering the church must come through tǎis room, except on holidays. The leser clenc, after bidding visitors to be seated on hard benches near the door (not on the padded chairs near the fireplace), invites them to peruse the religious tracts and scrolls on a nearby table, and indicates the location of the poorbox (which is emptied after each visitor), then steps out for 2-12 minutes. Upon return­ ing, the cleric enquires as to the visitors' busi­ ɾes .. If it is Ŕith the chief cleric nothing further is said until a contribution to the needy is given. Ab?ut 1-10 gp per level of the strongest c:_haracter m the party is a fair amount. Some­ times (50% chance) the person desired is unavailable, and the petitioners must return at a l.ater time and go through the same routine. Iniurŕ, sick, or needy folk are not subjected to this treatment, but al aid given is always for a return according to the recipient's ability. C 5. Vestry This private chamber is for the rest and relaxation of the clerics, as well as for their use in dressing for services. Steps lead to the upper floor. LOWER FLOOR (a high basement area, floored) C 6. Church Kitchen A serving woman and her husband prepare meals and care for the churchmen's needs here. All normal meals are taken here. 18 C 7.

Chief Priest's Chamber This is a comfortably furnished, well­ appointed room. The mantle of the fireplace contains a hidden cache known only to Y'dey (Nulb encounter key, area 3). The mantle lifts up to reveal compartments which hold a bronze neck chain (set with six rubies worth 1,00 gp each), an amber cud­ gel (worth 2,500 gp) descending from a chain (worth 7,500 gp), a mace + 1, and a scroll of protection from demons. Terjon keeps church funds in a locked iron coffer under his bed, which currently holds 546 cp, 317 sp, 88 ep, 102 gp, and 16 pp. Of all rela­ tively minor contributions, 30% is first removed (20% for Terjon, 10% for Calmert), and the remainder placed here. These are the usual salary amounts; reduce them in cases of large grants or gifts to the church. C 15. Balcony From this spot, about 15 ' above the floor below, the chief cleric of the church delivers his weekly and special addresses and ser­ mons. AREA 31. GUARD 10WER GT I. Main Hall This is the entry to the tower on this level. The drawbridge is one foot thick oak plank­ ing bound with iron, and is operated by a windlass. The small entryway is closed off by a stone wall and an inner door of iron. A guard is on duty. The door is flanked by shuttered arrow slits, and two murder holes are in the ceil­ ing. Flanking the inner portal are two fire­ places, where most of the cooking is done by two to three servants. The lords of the place sit in judgement either here or at a table in the curved alcove. Trestle tables can be extended down and across to accommo­ date about 40 people when a feast or revel is held. Several comfortable chairs are placed along the walls, and the walls themselves are hung with tapestries and decorated with shields, arms, and hunting trophies-12 shields, four long swords, two broad swords, four spears, two battle axes, and the heads and horns of various creatures. Ramps curving upwards and downwards lead to other levels. · Guard: AC 5 (scale mail & shield); Level 2 Fighter hp 12; #AT l; D 1-8 (longsword); AL NG; XP 44 GT 2. Lower Level This is the ground level where the outer batter (splay) thickens the wall. Here are all sorts of supplies-food, ale, beer, wine, oil, and so forth. This place is not pierced with slits or windows. Ramps lead up and down to other levels of the tower. GT 3. Dungeon or Cellar Level Horses are sometimes stabled here, and there are heaps of straw, hay and oats to pro­ vide for their needs. Normally only the steeds of Burne and Rufus (light and heavy war­ horses, respectively) are kept here at night. Four cells along the southeast wall are for pris­ oner retention. Each is closed by an oaken door, barred, locked, and chained. In each cell are fetters and chains. The secret door leads to a small natural cave with a spring. UPPER LEVEL GT 4. Hall and Ladderway The upper levels of the tower can be reached from this point by a steep set of retractable wooden stairs about three feet wide, very similar to a ladder. A guard is on duty at the foot of the ladderway. Guard: AC 5 (scale mail & shield); Level 2 Fighter; hp 11; #AT l; D 1-8 (long­ sword); AL LG; XP 42 GT 5. Rufus' Chamber This is a well-furnished room with a large bed, chest, chest of drawers, armoire, and wardrobe. A large chair, table, and stool complete the furniture. There are rugs and skins on the floor, tapestries on the wall, and a longbow and quiver of arrows hang­ ing near the bed. The quiver contains 14 silver-tipped arrows and six magical arrows + 2. Under a loose stone in the fireplace is an iron box with 200 gp, 100 pp, five violet gar­ nets, and five black pearls (each gem worth 500 gp). GT 6. Burne's Chamber This room is quite similar to that of Rufus, though it is more spartan. A work­ bench occupies so much space that a narrow pallet must serve, instead of a comfortable 19 bed. Various items of use in magical research line the shelves-alembics, beak­ ers, jars, flasks, and the like-most filled with strange substances. A clutter of parch­ ments, scrolls, and a few books are spread on a table-desk. Clumps of dried vegetable matter, bunches of herbs, bones, skulls, and bottles of fluids fill a wall case, hang from the ceil­ ing, and appear here and there in the clutter. Robes, cloaks, and capes of various sorts and color are hanging from pegs near the entry, where a large black and magical staff leans against the wall. (This normal staff bears Nystul's magic Aura was cast upon it). A box under the pallet holds three daggers and a score of darts, and various and sundry items of dungeoneering equipment, among them six vials of holy water, a silver holy symbol, a wand with continual light upon it (kept in an ivory tube lined with black vel­ vet), and a silver knife. Burne's spell book is camouflaged to appear as the seat of the only armchair in the room. A flat chest, fastened among the rafters and appearing as if part of the flooring overhead, contains his wealth. In it are 122 gems worth a total of 14,500 gp (five emeralds, eight topaz, five aquamarines, four peridots, and 100 ornamental 10 gp stones) and a locked iron coffer which holds 200 gp, a ring set with an emerald (3,00 gp total value) and a scroll of seven spells. Burne is debating whether to use the scroll to expand his spell book, or to save it for an emergency. The scroll contains compre­ hend languages, miror image, pyrotechnics, web, sugestion, ice stonn, and transmute rock to mud. PARAPET LEVEL GT 7. Hall The ladderway from below exits here, where an iron door leads to the parapet sur­ mounting the tower. Another ladderway extends to the upper level of the turret. A barrel of 20 javelins stands beside the door. GT 8. Mercenary Captain's Room This chamber is sparsely furnished, with a score of arrows and five times as many cross­ bow bolts stored near the door. A small coffer holds 173 pp and two star sapphires (worth 1,00 gp each).

Mercenary Lieutenant's Room This room is much the same as the captain's quarters, except that there are eight quivers full of arrows here and no bolts. He has a purse containing 50 gp, five amethysts, five red garnets, four red spinels, and a piece of amber (each gem worth 100 gp). GT 10. Parapet As noted previously, the battlement is machicolated. The merlons are pierced for archery, and a light catapult is at each posi­ tion marked A on the map. Smooth boul­ ders and small rocks are stacked around the base of the turret and near the engines as well. Two guards are on duty.

Turret Level This place is filled with racked pallets for the men-at-arms, who generally sleep here but are otherwise busy elsewhere. GT 12. Turret Roof This position is reached by ladder from below. The battlement is machicolated, with pierced merlons. A scorpion is at each position marked S on the map, and a long box which holds their ammunition, 30 heavy spears, stands nearby. Another chest contains rags and pots of oil for the making of flaming missiles to fire from the scorpi­ ons. There is usually a guard here. Guard: AC 5 (scale mail & shield); Level 2 Fighter; hp 11; #AT 1; D 1-8 (long­ sword); XP 42 Burne's Badgers These mercenaries are all Chaotic Neutral or true Neutral in alignment. They were brigands for a time, but decided that there was better pay and Jess risk serving Burne and Rufus, who took them prisoner and then spared them. Loyalty is good and morale is high. They have had some action against other marauders, receive top money, and spend an ample amount of off­ duty time drinking and carousing at the inn. The 16 men-at-arms are Jed by two fighters. Both of the leaders like the village, and have no desire to leave it or their current employ­ ment. All of Burne's Badgers (including the four guards at areas Tl, T4, and TIO) are capable of winding and loading the scorpions and catapults.

Old­ timers know far more of the tale than newcomers, and certain special individuals (notably those on the Town Council) could relate the whole story as found here, given sufficient provocation and trust in those inquiring. It is unlikely that such trust will be cause for revelation even so, unless seri­ ously interested characters attend a special Council meeting for the express purpose of aiding the village through their explora­ tions. The appended boxed information is to be read as the characters head for the ruins. This place was once the outpost of the Temple of Elemental Evil, its watchtower and an advance base for raids, looting, and destruction. From this area, servants of the Temple were to bring the Village of Hom­ mlet and all the lands around it into subjec­ tion. The conquered folk were then to be used as slaves to construct yet another for­ tress further west, spreading the evil power of the Temple in ever-growing rings to encompass all of the land around its base. This outpost was ignored during the destruction of the Temple, for the army of good which came against the wicked hordes was so strong as to be totally immune to any pinpricking from the garrison of the moathouse. Only after the end of the battle which destroyed the main armies of the Temple of Elemental Evil was attention turned to this place. A detachment of horse and foot with a small siege train then came to the marshlands, to lay the castle low. The common folk from miles around came to help, and the moathouse was surrounded, cut off, and battered into extinction. The place is now shunned by the people of Hom­ mlet, who hate its former evil and the mem­ ory of the terror brought to them by the black lord of the fortress-a vile cleric of damnation-and his evil men and human­ oid troops. A scrub of thorns, thistles, weeds, and shrubs grows thickly along the edge of the track which leads to the ruins. Even the track is mostly overgrown and clut­ tered with fallen branches and trees. Here and there it· is washed out, in other places a mire. Some game evidently still follows the pathway, however, for after a mile or so faint traces can be seen. But even consid­ ering this, going is slow, and it takes over an hour to reach the place on horseback, or two to trudge along on foot. Consid­ erable hacking and clearing is necessary to make the way passable, so double the time required for the first trip. After two miles, as the track turns more northerly, the land begins to sink and become boggy. Tall marsh plants grow thickly where cattails and tamaracks do not. Off to the left can be seen the jagged silhou­ ette of the moathouse. A side path, banked high to cross over the wetland to either side, just north to the entrance of the ruin. The track here is only about 15 feet wide or so, with crum­ bling embankments making travel near the edge dangerous. The bogs stink. The vegetation appears dense and prolific, but somehow sickly and unhealthy, creepers and vines throwing their stran­ gling loops over the skeletons of dead saplings and living bushes alike. The rushes and cattails rustle and bend even to a slight zephyr, and weird birdcalls, croakings, and other unwholesome sounds come faintly across the fen. The track continues past the ruins for many miles-seven leagues, in fact, to Nulb. UPPER LEVEL OF THE RUINS RANDOM ENCOUNTERS Encounter occurs 1 in 12; roll ld6 for type.

POOL The following encounter should chal­ lenge a party of 5-8 characters of 1st or 2nd level. If fewer characters are present, or if 2nd level characters are lacking (one or none), the DM should decrease the number of monsters accordingly, first omitting one of the larger creatures, then the smaller, leaving one large monster at all times. Do not, however, add to the number. If the characters are all 2nd or higher level, con­ vert small monsters to large specimens. Roll ld6; six giant frogs herein surprise intruders on a result of 1-4. These nasty things leap from their lurking places in the tall weeds near the edge of the pool, to a maximum range of 12 ". They attack madly, for they are voraciously hungry at all times. If characters are mounted, check to see if the horses panic and throw their riders or plunge into the marsh and become mired. The chance of panic is 90 % for most mounts, but only 10% for a warhorse. If panic occurs, the chance of either subse­ quent occurrence is 50% (check for each, per horse; both may occur to one victim). Each of the two larger frogs has a tongue 12 feet long; the smaller tongue is a mere 6 feet. If its prey is more than 5 feet away, a frog uses its tongue to attack (gaining a + 4 "to hit" bonus, but for no damage). Any vic­ tim hit by the tongue may attack it, and if successful the frog withdraws it and does not use it thereafter. Otherwise, the victim is pulled in by the tongue. A victim weighing more than the frog is dragged in at half speed, gaining a second attempt to hit the tongue. Each of the small frogs weighs about 100 pounds; each of the larger, 200. For added fun, each frog can swallow an elf, halfling, or small human if its "to hit" 0zjGiilAL ADVEilTV'S REiilCAR_IlATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EllTAL EVI L roll is 20. The victim has three tries to escape if an edged weapon is in hand; a score of 18 or more is required for success (indicating that the frog is slain). After three failures, a swallowed victim dies. The largest frog has swallowed an amethyst (worth 100 gp), but the others are penniless.

ROTTING DRAWBRIDGE When the moathouse was taken, part of the drawbridge was battered through, and men crossed on planks to gain access to the inner gates. The chains of the drawbridge were bro­ ken, and it fell; it has remained thus since. It is strong enough to bear a man, but any mount crossing over may break through and injure a leg. The chance is 50% for a horse, 30% for a mule, and 20% for a pony. The injury reduces the mount to 2/3 of full hit points (rounded up, permanent until magically cured), and reduces movement rate and encumbrance figures to half normal. 3. BROKEN GATES The door is hanging open on one great hinge, the other is splintered and holed but still in position, wedged and shored closed from the inside. A careful examination of the ground here reveals boot prints in the ground, heading for the building steps at area S. It is SO% likely that a pair of brigands (from area 7) are here, see the party, and retreat to their lair, giving warning to .the group. If so, the party will be aware of none of this, unless using wizard eye or some other sort of invisible advance scouting. 4. 10WER The upper portion of the tower has col­ lapsed, and the interior is dark. Even if an arrow slit is peered through, infravision will reveal nothing. The occu­ pant lurks above. A scattering of husks and a few bones lie on the floor, possibly giving warning to the wary, but the gleam of coins therein may tempt investigation. A great wolf spider is crouched on the remains of an upper floor some lS feet over­ head. It leaps (range 3 ") and bites as soon as anyone steps into the tower. It gains surprise on a roll of 1-S (ld6). Amidst the rubbish are 71 cp and 38 sp, and an ivory box about the size of a large book (easily worth SO gp or more to the right buyer). Huge spider (1): AC 6; HD 2 + 2; hp 14; MV 18 "; #AT 1; D 1-6 + poison ( + 1 bonus to saving throw); XP 187 5. LIITERED STEPS This staircase leads to the house portion of the fortres. A careful examination of these steps reveals that some traffic (human, animal, and perhaps otherwise) comes this way. The doors at the head of the stairs are broken-one flat on the floor, the other sundered. 6. GREAT HALL This was once a great audience chamber, as shown by the tattered banners and tapestries on the walls, destroyed furni­ ture, and heaps of rotting cloth thrown into comers. Once richly appointed, it has been thoroughly searched, sacked, and despoiled. Leaves and dirt cover the floor, and cobwebs hang from walls and the ceiling above. Looking up, you see that pieces of beams and chunks of stone poke through, indicating that the upper stories of the place are totally destroyed and likely to be impassable to anything larger than a rat. 7. BRIGANDS Holed up in this 'Black Chamber; the quarters of the former Lord of the castle, are eight brigands and their leader, a Level 2 fighter. The heavy door has been repaired by these outlaws, and it is usually barred and bolted as well. They are not aware of the secret door nor the stairway down. The chamber is floored in black flag­ stones, and has ebon-colored wall hangings (now burnt and tattered) in addition to the jumbled wreckage noted. The brigands pitch bedrolls in odd corners, and the remains of fires can be noted in the northern fireplace. 22 If brigand sentries were at area 3 when the party approached (a 50% chance), they have retreated here, and the others are warned of the party's approach. At least one brigand always watches the escape route (the ruined wall in the southeast corner, and the stepping stones across the moat). The brigands' actions vary by the party's apparent strength: Weak: The brigands hide in the clutter of wrecked furniture, gaining surprise on 1-S (on ld6). Capable: The brigands lock their door, and leave if it is battered. They take only their petty loot, leaving the rest safely hidden. Overwhelming: The brigands sneak out as soon as the party is detected, taking all of their loot and heading for greener pastures.

The brigands have buried a chest under the rubble where the wall collapsed. Three turns of digging can uncover the loot. The chest holds 2,00 cp, two bolts of fine cloth worth 60 gp each, a crystal flagon and four goblets (the set worth 80 gp), an inlaid wooden box with ivory handles and decora­ tions (4S gp), and four magical arrows + 1. 0.RjGi ilAL ADVEil'f'V S REi il CARJIA'fED • THE TEDIPLE 0F ELED:rEllTAL EVIL 8. STAIRWAY UP After a tew steps the risers are covered with dust, crushed stone, broken wood, and burned heaps of cloth. At the landing halfway up they are completely choked with rubble, and it is impossible to clear the loose stone and huge wall section to allow pasage. The entire upper floor is collapsed and ruined. 9. LIITERED ROOM This room was once a conference cham­ ber, but is now empty. Its dirt and wreckage show no signs of any recent occupant, though a couple of small rats are seen scur­ rying away. There is nothing of any value within except a very fine broadsword wedged behind a splintered wall case, the contents of which are long gone. 10. EMPTY BEDCHAMBER Once the quarters of a castle troop leader or some other petty official, this place is now a total wreck. The bed is chopped to pieces, and the furniture is smashed or missing. 11. SALON This room was once very opulent, obvi­ ously a place of many expensive furnish­ ings. The remaining bits and tatters still appear rich (though none are of value). If the party investigates the room, scores of bats flutter angrily around. In the confu­ sion, any light source will probably (75% chance) be dropped and extinguished. Any­ one striking at the bats after the lights go out may (50% chance) hit the nearest party member instead, inflicting double normal damage if a hit is scored against the victim's rear Armor Class. 12. CORNER ROOM After one of their number was slain here a few weeks ago, the brigands gave this room and the entry corridor a wide berth. A huge adder, over 12 feet long, dwells here. It crawled up the rubble spilled into the moat, and found a nice safe lair where it could hole up after hunting. In the litter of its nesting place is a jeweled dagger worth 850 gp.

SlOREROOM AND STAIRWAY Some rustling and squeaking will betray the presence of a hungry horde of giant rats. Any bite may inflict disease; the chance is 5 %  (check per hit). These rodents live on the shelves along the walls, and some lurk around the staircase. They are hungry and attack without fear. Though they have no treasure, an overlooked jug of oil (10 flasks' worth) is on the upper shelf of the storage area, and on the fifth stair down is a gold ring worth 40 gp. However, if the party does not search, the ring will probably pass unnoticed. Roll ld20 per person using the stairs; the ring is discovered on a roll of 1. Giant Rats (13): AC 7; HD 1/2; hp 4 (x4); 3 (x2); 2 (x3); 1 (x4); #AT 1; D 1-3 + disease (5%); XP 11 (x4), 10 (x2), 9 (x2), 8 (x4) 14. TROPHY ROOM Only a few mangy pelts, stuffed heads, and shattered antlers indicate the former status of the chamber. All worthwhile items are looted. Considerable time may be spent searching the litter herein, but nothing of value will be found. 15. DOMICILE This place was the domicile of the major­ domo of the castle, but is now stripped of everything save broken and ruined furnish­ ings. One wall cresset remains near the outer wall, and its nondescript torch stub is a silver baton worth 30 gp. 16. KITCHEN The remains of moldering foodstuffs and kitchen work tables are visible. A wooden cask near the fireplace on the north wall looks inviting, but anyone approaching it is attacked by a giant tick! (If the attack hits, the victim takes 1-4 points of damage from the bite and 1-6 points per round thereafter from blood drain, with no "to hit" roll needed.) This horror came in through the chimney. No treasure is here. Giant Tick: AC 3; HD 3; hp 19; MV 3 "; #AT l; D 1-4; SA blood drain for D 1-6 per round; XP 141 17. BARRACKS A giant lizard is in the south end of the 23 room, near an intact chest. The monster attacks anyone invading its lair. It has previ­ ously swallowed a shield + 1, easily found if appropriate actions are taken after the bat­ tle. The chest holds 33 cp, a scale mail tunic, a light crossbow, and a case of 24 quarrels. In this partially collapsed chamber, the remains of cots and plain wooden chests indi­ cate that this was once a barracks room for cas­ tle guards-undoubtedly the.human sort.

STAIRWAY ARCH Two nauseous blobs of green slime have been carefully placed and fed in a position over the central arch at the base of the stair­ way. Anyone descending the stairs and step­ ping onto the dungeon floor will probably (75% chance) cause one of the two slimes to dislodge itself and fall squarely upon the victim. Any cautious approach (either look­ ing up or moving along the walls) will avoid this, but then anyone passing through the northern portion of the 10 feet square will run the same (75 % ) risk of being attacked. The room contains no treasure. A few tom sacks, broken barrels, and shattered weapons racks show that this large area was once a storage place and armory for the fortress. Great heaps of worthless rubble and broken containers and furniture are at the western end of the room, all obviously junk (but conceal­ ing the doors to rooms 19 and 20). Green Slimes (2): AC 7; HD 2; hp 10, 7; MV O; #AT 1 (drip); D turn to slime in 1-4 rounds; XP 630, 628 19. DOOR The lock of this portal is secured, obvi­ ously new, and well-oiled. If not picked, the door can be chopped or smashed down by axe or hammer, withstanding 50 points of damage before splintering open. Inside the room are 30 shields, 12 suits of leather armor, and several barrels. Most of the lat­ ter contain salted meat, but two in the rear are 5-gallon kegs of an average brandy, worth 80 gp each. 20. DOOR This portal is also locked, as is area 19. Behind it are 50 spears, 10 glaives, six guisarmes, three battle axes, 70 black capes (each with a yellow eye of fire sewed on the cen­ ter), more containers of provisions, a crate of 120 arrows, and a crate of 200 crossbow bolts. 21. CORRIDOR AND CELLS Two zombies are hiding behind the north­ ernmost pillar, at the end of the hall. They move to attack any intruders approaching the entrance to area 22. One round after they are sen, another pair of zombies appears from the southernmost cubicle (nearest the stairs), attacking the party from the rear. Each of the remaining cubicles also contains two zombies, and one pair enters the engagement each round (12 zombies in all). Try to corner the party in area 22. The zombies attack until slain or turned, of course. They have no treasure, but a peridot (500 gp gem) was long ago hidden behind a loose stone in the northernmost cell (the last to disgorge zombies). If this cell is searched, the loose piece in the wall will probably be found (50% chance per searcher per round).

TORTURE CHAMBER At first glance this place seems long aban­ doned; dust, dirt, and cobwebs abound. A careful perusal shows, however, that sev­ eral of the skeletons fa the place are not old remnants, and some of the instruments and mechanisms have been used very recently indeed. Only if exacting care is taken in inspecting the floor can some drops of blood be noticed, leading south (the trail of a sloppy ghoul). Without this clue it is 90% likely that the secret door in the pillar will go undiscovered. Check only once per char­ acter looking, but roll dice as if normal checks were being made. (If the trail is dis­ covered, apply normal chances of locating the secret door mechanism-I in 6 for non­ elven characters, 2 in 6 for elven). Inside the pillar is a shaft some 30 feet deep, with iron rungs set into the stonework for easy descent. The rungs are obviously 24 used with some frequency. 23. LITTERED STOREROOM The mess of filth and broken junk is utterly unremarkable. For a person of aver­ age strength, the door opens with a roll of 1- 4 (on ld6), and makes no noise. If the characters are cautious as they open the door, they might (50% chance) note the grease on the door hinges. 24. LARGE ROOM Lubash, an ogre, has been lured here and into service by baubles and the promise of fresh human meat. He will immediately attack intruders who do not wear the sym­ bol of the new master (the yellow eye of fire). Those properly clad must still make the secret sign (crossed arms before the face) to prevent the ogre's attack. Lubash will devour the slain at the first opportunity, tossing wounded and prisoners into room 25. He will pursue a fleeing party, but only as far as the stairs up (area 18). The ogre has a heap of old clothing and skins for a bed, and a large wooden chest for his treasures-worthless glass beads, brass candlesticks and other trash, 823 cp, 46 sp, and 3 gp. However, by some trick of fate, a small-sized elven cloak is intermixed with the old carpeting and rags of his bedding. Ogre: AC 5; HD 5 + l; hp 21; MV 9 "; #AT 1; D 7-13 (2d4 + 5, bardiche); XP 195 25. 0AK DOOR This portal is heavily barred, for this is the grisly pantry of Lubash the ogre. It cur­ rently houses a pair of humans who have undergone only mild torture, plus a badly beaten gnome upon whom Lubash intended to soon dine-a mere snack, and tough, but a nice change nonetheless. If rescued, the humans will admit to being merchants. Both will promise large rewards for their release, vowing to send the monies to Hommlet as soon as they return to their homes in Dyvers. Four weeks after their release, a passing caravan will deliver 100 sp per merchant to the rescuers. If the merchants are rescued, their XP value (14 each) is awarded to the party. If slain, deduct 50 XP per merchant from the party's total. .Apply the same principle to the gnome (XP 20). 0R,j:Gi ITAL ADVEITTV'S REi ITCAR_IlATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EITTAL EVIL The gnome was caught spying by some gnolls, and he too will ask to be freed, giv­ ing a plain iron ring to whomever first so agrees. This ring is recognized 70% of the time by gnomes within 100 miles of the area as a sign that the bearer is an ally, thus mak­ ing it 25% more probable that they will be friendly and helpful. 26. UNDETECTED TRAP The party will not notice that a huge iron grate could fall from above at this point in the corridor. The underside is even with the tunnel ceiling 15 feet above, and is painted a grayish brown to blend with the stone. The trap's two triggers are false doors, described as area 28 but located separately. 26a. The secret door (detectable at normal chances) leads to a winch, which is used to haul the grate back up. The lowered grate cannot otherwise be raised unless three or more individuals with ogre strength (18/00) all work together to do so. 27. RECRUITS This is the lair of six bugbears, who have recently been recruited by the New Master (room 35). If any lights are shown in the chamber to the north, these creatures sneak forth quietly to investigate, gaining surprise on l-3 (ld6). The bugbears know only that the Master is quartered somewhere to the north. Each has 12 gp. The leader (17 hp) wears a brace­ let, which is actually a silver necklace (worth 450 gp) set with five gems of chryso­ prase (four small, worth 50 gp each, and one of larger size worth 100 gp). Bugbears (6): AC 5; HD 3 + l; hp 17; 14, 12, 11, 11, 9; #AT l; D 2-8 (morning star); SA surprise on 1-3; XP 203, 191, 183, 179 (x2), 171 28. DOR This portal is a fake. When pulled open, a bare stone wall is revealed behind. At the same time, a distant clangor sounds (the grate, falling in area 26). 29. ODD SIDE ROOM Herein is the lair of nine gnolls recruited by the New Master (area 35). They attack intruders, fighting fiercely and to the death if necessary. However, they are 75 % likely to stop and listen if an offer to parley is made, for they are not satisfied with their lot. They have lost six members while raid­ ing to the east and south of the ruins, are dissatisfied with their loot, and are irate about the greater status accorded the newly recruited bugbears (area 27). The gnolls speak bugbear, ogre, and their own tongue, but no Common. If offered six or more gp each (triple awards for the leader), they desert their current station. If double this fee is offered and paid, they lead the characters to the north passage toward the Master's room, and even tell of human guards. The gnolls then proceed west to the exit and never return. Each gnoll has 3-18 sp and a like number of coppers as well. The leader has 11 gp and a pretty lump of blue quartz worth 10 gp. Gnolls (9): AC 5; HD 2; hp 14, 12, 10 (x3), 9 (x3), 7; #AT l; D 2-8 (battle axe); SA 2 have longbows, each with 20 arrows; XP 56, 52, 48 (x3), 46 (x3), 42 JO. POOL When the dungeons were dug, this natu­ ral pool of water was found. As it is consid­ erably below floor level, the area was dug lower and the entrance to the pool enlarged. Some connection to an underground stream must exist, for some time ago, a giant cray­ fish took the pool as its own. It now disputes with any creatures entering, hoping to make a meal in the bargain. (The men-at-arms from area 33 hold it at bay by prodding with pole arms; all others take their chances.) The monster has been fairly successful, and there are bones and litter in and around the pool. If badly wounded, the crayfish retreats into a very deep central section of the pool, and does not return for 24 or more hours. Near the back (northeast) edge of the pool are 17 cp, 30 sp, 19 gp, and a normal long­ sword. In the water on a ledge is a platinum pin set with a smallish ruby (worth 2,00 gp) and a bone tube. The pin is under a skull, and the tube rests under some bones. Unless searchers use their hands, either or both treasures may (50% chance for each) slip off the ledge and be lost below. The tube is watertight and contains a scroll of three magic-user spells (push, stinking cloud, fly), but does not float. 25 Giant Crayfish: AC 4; HD 4 + 4; hp 27; MV 6 "/ /12 "; #AT 2; D 2-12/2-12; XP 225 Jl. BURIAL CRYPTS The builders of the dungeon planned for a long tenancy (though their expectations were not met). Most of the niches are empty, but a few contain splintered coffins, wrap­ pings, and gnawed and split bones (a sure sign that all is not well). Squatting in the north end of the room are four ghouls, who attack as soon as they see intruders. These creatures get corpses to eat from the Master-and sometimes even prey on those not yet dead (from area 22), so they can have some 'sport' before dining. They have no treasure (not here, at least). Ghouls (4): AC 6; HD 2; hp 12, 10, 8, 7; #AT 3; D 1-4/1-4/1-8; SA paralysis (save negates, elves immune; DR 3-12 turns); XP 89, 85, 81, 79 Jla. The back of a crypt is broken out, leading to an earth tunnel, which is foul and damp and only about 5 feet high. The tunnel leads to a noisome den (A) where a heap of bones and skulls indicates the ghouls' nest. Their treasure is scattered in the mess-80 sp, seven vials of holy water, a potion of undead control. and a scroll of protection from undead. A trail of gold pieces (1-4 per 10 feet of tunnel) begins at area B, leading generally eastward. Jlb. A warren of small burrows (3 feet in diameter and smaller) starts here. Mapping is not possible. After about 30 feet of travel, the trail of gold ends. If the characters follow the tunnels off the mapped portion, allow them to proceed another hundred feet, and then tell them they are hopelessly lost. 32. PASSAGE The corridor here begins to slant gradu­ ally upwards, and a slight breeze can be felt after 100 feet beyond the edge of the map. After another 300 feet, the tunnel ends in a narrow opening amidst rocks, thick briars and brambles-open air. JJ.

These humans are the alert and fearless 0NGi ITAL ADVEilTV'S REiITCAR._IlATED • THE TEDIPLE 0F ELEDlEllTAL EVIL guards of the 'New Master' (room 35). Their Sergeant is usuaJly in area 33, but he patrols the whole area regularly. When attacked, a guard sends up a low hooting sound while engaging. This brings the others, plus reinforcements from area 34 (six more guards with spears, and their Ser­ geant). The reinforcements take 4-5 rounds to arrive there to ready themselves, one to move to area 33, and another to reach the north passage (if needed there). If the guards are losing the fray, they start howling. This brings all guards in the area, and the Master as well. (See above for time required.) Each guardsman has 2-8 sp, 2-5 gp, and 1-4 pp. The Sergeant has double those amounts of coin, and wears a gold neckchain of office (worth SO gp). Guardsmen (6): AC 5 (scale mail & shield); Level 1 Fighters; hp 7, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4; MV 9"; #AT l; D by weapon: each has long­ sword (D 1-8), dagger (1-4), light cross­ bow and 30 quarrels (1-4); XP 25, 24, 23 (x2), 22 (x2) Sergeant: AC 4 (chain & shield); Level 2 Fighter; hp 15; #AT 1; D by weapon: morning star (D 2-8), hammer (2-5), dag­ ger (1-4); XP 66 34. BARRACKS CHAMBER Quartered here are 12 guards and two ser­ geants, all armed and armored as those in area 33, except that six guards bear spears instead of crossbows. These six and their sergeant are the reinforcements arriving in area 33 if fighting occurs. Also here is the New Master's lieutenant, an evil hero. He stays near his liege lord always, and will accompany him wherever he goes. In the 20 'x 40' room to the northeast are supplies for the guards-salted meat, weak wine in a barrel, water, hard biscuits, dried fruit, and so forth. There are also mounds of fresh rushes and grass, for bedding and for two light warhorses stabled at the north end of the place. Saddles, tack, and a lance are nearby. The lieutenant has 29 gems in his purse, each worth 100 gp (three amethysts, eight pieces of fine coral, nine red garnets, six pearls, and three tourmalines), and wears a platinum chain of office (1000 gp) in which a topaz (500 gp) is prominently set. Lieutenant: AC 1 (plate & shield); Level 4 Fighter; hp 31; MV 6 "; #AT 1 or 2; D 2-9 (longsword) or 1-6/1-6 (longbow), also carries hand axe (D 2-7), dagger (2-5); XP 259; S 15 I 12 W 10 D 15 Co 17 Ch 7 35. CHAMBER OF THE NEW MASTER The Master's chamber is lavishly furnished, with thick rugs, wall hangings, and soft chairs, couch, and cushions. Wines, liquors, and dishes of sweetmeats abound. A brazier continually burns, warming the place and sending a fragrant incense into the air. Silver serving pieces and goblets (worth 4,00 gp for all) and an alabaster box filled with unguents (total value 80 gp) are in plain sight. Hidden in a cabinet is an exquisite piece of jewelry, made with matched fire opals (ten gems worth 1,00 gp each) on a gold chain and settings with diamond chips (5,00 gp). The New Mas­ ter, Lareth, is described more fully below. He carries but 9 pp and one black opal (1,00 gp). On his left arm is bound a phylactery of action, a clerical magical item which makes the wearer impervious to paralyzation of any sort, including all hold spells and spell-like powers. Lareth will aid his guards' melee with his spells, keeping a defensive posture while commanding his troops' attacks. He will melee if necessary, and probably after using his spells. He wields a mace in his left hand (D 1-6, -2 "to hit" as secondary weapon) and a staff of striking in his right (staff + 3, D 4- 9, 20 charges; uses 1 per hit, or 2 for double damage, 3 for triple). If seriously threatened, Lareth will offer all his non-magical treasures-jewelry, coins, and all else-as ransom for his life. If Lareth is slain, there will be cautious and discreet inquiries in Hommlet, as the ser­ vants of evil therein make every attempt to find out what happened. If any of Lareth's possessions turn up, the slayers are revealed. An assassin of 10th level who can speak the alignment language of the individ­ uals, as well as those of major allies, will come to the village in 5-20 days to eliminate the offender(s). DM, handle this as you see fit. Jaroo and Terjon of Hommlet will cer­ tainly aid those attacked. If the assassin is killed, nothing further will be attempted. Lareth: AC -1 (plate mail + 1); Level 5 Cleric; hp 44; #AT l; D 1-6 (mace) or 4-9 (or more, from staff of striking; 20 charges remain); SA spells (se below); SD immune to paralysis (phylactery of action); XP 770 26 S 18 W 18 D 17 C 16 Ch 18 First level: command, cure light wounds (x2), protection from good, sanctuary Second level: hold person (x2), know align· ment, resist fire, silence 15 ' radius Third level: cause blindness, continual darkness Lareth the Beautiful is the dark hope of chaotic evil-young, handsome, well endowed in abilities and aptitudes, thor­ oughly wicked, depraved, and capricious. Whomever harms Lareth had best not brag of it in the presence of one who will inform the Demoness Lolth! Lareth has been sent to this area to rebuild a force of men and humanoid fighters to gather loot and restore the Temple of Ele­ mental Evil to its former glory. He is but one of many so charged, of course, but is looked upon with special favor and expectation. He and his minions have been careful to raid far from this area, never nearer than three or four leagues, travelling on foot or riding in wagons of the traders from Hommlet. None of the victims are ever left alive to tell the tale, and mysterious disappearances are all that can be remarked upon. No trace of men, mounts, goods, wagons cir draft ani­ mals is ever found. Evil to the core, Lareth is cuning. If a situa­ tion appears in doubt, he uses bribery and honeyed words to sway the balance to his favor. He is not adverse to gaining new recruits of all sorts, and will gladly accept adventurers into the ranks (though he will test and try them continually). Those who arouse suspicion will be quietly murdered in their sleep. Those with too much promise will be likewise dealt with, for Lareth wants no poten· tial usurpers or threats to his domination. ORIGINAL CREDITS Layout and Editing: Timothy Jones Editorial Assistance: Mike Carr & Al Hammack Art & Maps: Dave Trampier & Dave Sutherland 0R.iGiIIAL ADVEII'f'V'S REiIICAR._IIA'f'ED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEIITAL EVI L Interlude: Hommlet to Nulb PLAYERS' BACKGROUND The pleasant and semingly peaceful vil­ lage of Hommlet turned out to be filled with intrigue, with agents of Chaotic Evil hiding within the hamlet. The supposedly deserted and ruined moathouse nearby held a new champion of the nearby Temple of Elemental Evil. All of this brought dan­ ger and difficulty to the members of your group, but it also offered adventure, expe­ rience, and wealth. You have either slain or driven off the evil men and creatures, and the able guardians of Hommlet-Jaroo, Terjon, Elmo, and the rest of the sturdy militiamen-can surely see to it that their area remains clean of the taint of Evil hereafter. Having accomplished most of your goals, you must now look else­ where for yet greater challenges (and commensurate rewards). If agents of the Temple were still active in Hommlet, then there must certainly be work for you at that fountainhead of wickedness. Just a half-day's journey afoot (only about two hours' ride), east along the High Road, lies the disreputable commu­ nity of Nulb, and the Temple hidden in the hills nearby. This vile place spawned much suffering, ruin and death before the hosts of Good brought it low and bound its power. It is evident that the place was wounded but not slain, for dark things crept into Hommlet under direction of someone or some thing still lurking in the shunned edifice of Evil. The upper works of the Temple were thrown down and destroyed in the final siege of the war against its hordes. Because of its great power and evil, how­ ever, the conquerors did not actually raze the Temple proper, instead sealing its great doors and placing mighty wards of all sorts upon the place and the black labyrinth beneath. Even as great a force as overthrew the Temple could not cleanly deal with what lurked below. Since that great battle, the Temple area has been shunned, its ruins deserted. The nearby village of Nulb has returned to a semblance of normal activity­ questionable at best, for the place has always been rumored to house thieves, brigands, smugglers and pirates. But as Nulb stinks of garbage and filth, the Temple area reeks of the foul corruption and pervading Evil from whence it was spawned. No wonder that both places have again been left to their own devices. When the Temple of Elemental Evil flourished, earthquakes, storms of all sorts, great fires, and flash floods struck areas nearby with seming capriciousness. All that ceased when the Temple was assaulted and sealed. You have been advised of all this, and urged to go else­ where to sek your fame and fortunes. The unease which prevails upon those merely passing near the ruins shows that some wickedness still haunts the place. There are many bad folk in Nulb, and still greater perils amidst the fallen Temple. Yet the lure of such adventure beckons to you, drawing your party as surely as a lodestone draws iron. Warnings against loss of life-or even worse fates-cannot counter the irresistable pull of treasures secreted deep underground, of monsters still unbeaten, of mysteries to be unrav­ eled. There are whispers of occult places beneath the interdicted Temple, where mighty Evil is yet wrought and noble folk are imprisoned. With care and cun­ ning, luck and great deeds, caution mixed with boldness and daring, you and your associates can win through to achieve exploits of the stuff of legend! The journey of a hundred leagues begins with the first pace, and the time for your sojourn has come. How you and your fellow adventurers plan to overcome the perils of the Temple is a matter that you must decide for yourselves. Is it best to reconnoiter from Hommlet7 Base your activities from the village of Nulb7 Try to make a secure wilderness camp somewhere near the ruin? Or perhaps lodge somewhere within the foreboding Temple itself? The decision is now. It is certain that both vast treasure and horrible death await, so you must gain the one while cheating the other. Fortune and the gods must smile upon such an undertaking. PLAYERS' HIS10RICAL NOTES The following is a summary of informa­ tion assumed to have been obtained from various sources in the village of Hommlet. Most or all of it should be revealed to play­ ers at this time. The DM should review it first, however, deleting such passages that 27 are incorrect in the campaign, and others that may (in the DM's opinion) be too revealing as yet. For many years, a cult of Chaotic Evil flourished somewhere on the shores of the Nyr Dyv. Although the location of their Temple is lost, these facts regarding it and its followers are known. The cult was based on the premise that the elemental forces of the universe are Chaotic and opposed to mankind, and are thus (from a humanocentric view­ point) Evil. The Temple of the cult sought to destroy all works of Good and to disrupt order. Its members were thieves, assassins, brigands, and the like. Fire was regarded as the first elemental evil, and its penchant for Chaos fitted the premise of the cult. Water was like­ wise worshipped as an even more power­ ful force of Chaotic Evil, in the form of floods, storms, and raging seas beating upon the land and ocean vessels. The epitome of Chaotic Evil, however, was regarded as a combination of air and earth, represented by blackness and cor­ responding with the demonic Abyss. This combination was regarded as a complete negation of matter. The cult grew powerful and rich, attracting followers of the worst sort and offering them safety within the walls of the Temple stronghold. From this for­ tress would the followers ride to rob, pil­ lage, and lay waste the lands about, tithing the cult from the spoils of the car­ nage. Captives from those raids were brought back to the Temple to serve as human sacrifices (children to the fire, men to the water, and women to the blackest Evil) or to slave their lives away in bondage. Besides the extensive upper works of the Temple, a deep labyrinth beneath the place was constructed, but virtually nothing is known about these dungeons except that they were inhab­ ited by a plethora of creatures serving Chaos and Evil. It is rumored that a demon took up abode in the deepest level, to better receive the sacrifices to it. Eventually the neighbors of the Tem­ ple grew tired of these depradations. All Good, both Lawful and Chaotic, banded together to form a mighty host. Their army marched to the Temple, fighting two battles along the way. The first was conclusive, thought the forces of Good 0R,jGiilAL A.DVEilTVR,J:S REiilCAR._IlATED • THE TEDIPLE 0F ELEDIEilTA.L EVI L who held the field afterward, so they gained the reputation of victory, and their ranks swelled with local men. The second battle saw a great slaughter of kobolds, goblins, ores, hobgoblins, evil men, and the like. The Temple was thereafter besieged, fell, and its inhabitants put to the sword. It is reported by some sources that the Temple and its precincts resisted complete destruc­ tion, but the majority state that the whole was razed so that the cult could never emerge again nor could any find where it once flourished. NOTES FOR THE DUNGEON MASTER The dungeons of the Temple of Elemental Evil are extensive. It is quite likely that many long adventures must be conducted before your players have exhausted its pos­ sibilities. You will, therefore, become not only intimately familiar with the Temple but will also come to know the Village of Nulb as if it were your own. In fact, the place is only sketched so that you can, in effect, make it so. This adventure began. in the Village of Hommlet, only about thirty miles west and south of the edge of the Nulb area map. You can easily construct your own campaign map by using graph paper of roughly the same parameters as that of the Nulb map, assuming 100 yards to the square. Two sheets of paper to the west and two to the south cover all of the important territory, with H9mmlet being located on the High Road, two maps west, one south near the map bottom, but in the southwest quad­ rant. (The Velverdyva River, by the way, generally remains along the upper portion of the northern map additions, bulging a bit on the first map addition to the west, then swinging northwards to flow along the very edge of the second map addition.) If you make such a map, players might wish to base their characters in Hommlet and ride to the Temple for adventures. This exposes them to more random danger, but it does give them a more friendly home base than otherwise, in all likelihood. If they inquire or search for themselves, they find that the only ford of the Imeryds Run is at Nulb, the next nearest being six leagues upstream. If characters base themselves in Nulb, they can stay at the hostel, or may attempt to buy a deserted structure somewhere else in the place. (Your option as to location, but cost should be about 500-800 gp for land and building, with an initial asking price of at least double that amount followed by slow, hard bargaining downwards). All repairs and safety measures must be accom­ plished by the characters, of course. A party based in Nulb will certainly attract attention if they are obviously of Good alignment or well-heeled. A few suc­ cessful raids on the Temple draw prowling · night monsters to the party-with some offensive aid from the inhabitants of Nulb. A great load of booty brought to Nulb by a weakened party is an open invitation to every pirate, brigand, and town militiaman to band together and overwhelm the stran­ gers to get the treasure! In any event, if there is continuing action in the village, you should prepare a map of the place, and pos­ sibly some of its main buildings, following the examples found in Hommlet. Only four places in Nulb are dealt with herein, and you should enjoy developing the remainder. As with the village, the Temple is reasona­ bly well-organized. While there is no partic­ ular rivalry in the village, the citizens are Chaotic and Neutral Evil by and large, so concerted action is limited in scope (i.e. numbers and time). Nulbish folk make fast raids, but are not prone to become involved in protracted plans and long sieges; they have other preferences. ThŘ Temple suffers from the same attitude, and it has its rival­ ries as well. After the short section hereafter pertaining to the village, the Temple is dealt with at great length. Following these sec­ tions, appendices on new monsters (includ­ ing the redoubtable St. Cuthbert) and magical items are given. Outdoor adventur­ ing is possible around Nulb and the upper ruins of the Temple, but the four dungeon levels and four Elemental nodes are certain to provide the greatest excitement and rich­ est rewards. As with any adventure, be certain to read and familiarize yourself with all the material thoroughly before you start the campaign. Adjust details to suit your own concept of a fantasy milieu; personalize things for your group; add things to make the work a more complete setting for the action to come­ and have at it! It is a certainty that the adventures cause changes; just accept them as they come, and emend accordingly. Adjust the Players' background notes to reflect their actions in Hommlet. Remember that the following adventures are designed for characters who, after starting at first 28 level in the Hommlet setting, have now fin­ ished that prelude and can continue with these challenges. WORLD OF GREYHAWK'" Setting Hommlet, Nulb, the Temple-all are vital parts of Greyhawk. This epic adventure formed the basis for a mini-campaign within the larger Greyhawk Campaign. It wasn't exactly a side show, as it turned out, but the adventuring began that way. Many veterans of the Greyhawk Campaign, as well as many newcomers, began adventuring in and around Hommlet about ten years ago. From these episodes rose Burne and Rufus, Jaroo, Terjon, Otis, Y'dey, and the rest. After clearing out all of the Temple's agents in the Hommlet area, various characters banded together to assault the Temple itself. Levels rose sufficiently that characters from the original Greyhawk Campaign became involved, and Lord Robilar eventually entered the Temple with a small party. Robilar arrived on his carpet of flying, and then set off into the Temple depths, leaving his trusty ore hero Quij to guard the transport device and a pair of griffons. While other adventurers had proceeded cir­ cumspectly, Robilar bulled his way through. Two days later, much of the Tem­ ple was sacked, bits and pieces of monsters were spread about, and a certain personage was loosed. But in the process, the minions of Good had been alerted, and they too arrived in the area, in force. Robilar left with pursuit hot on his tail, Quij wearing a new poncho he'd made from "master's fly­ ing rug" (two days being a long time to wait in the cold)! Robilar's ravages were followed by the army of enraged Good folk, led by Tenser and associates-including Otis; Burne, Rufus, et al. Zuggtmoy had been freed, but not much remained for her after all this fun, so, like Robilar, she also departed in some haste. The final result was a draw, with a strategic edge for Chaotic Evil. All of this happened on another world from yours; now you have a similar setting. Who knows how your campaign will develop? SECRET HISIORY OF THE TEMPLE When the demoness Zuggtmoy initially conceived the plan to establish her own rule on a portion of the Flanaess, she decided to use as many "tools" as possible, just as did 0RjGiilAL ADVEilTV'S REi ilCARJIATED • THE TEllPLE 0F ELEllEllTAL EVIL her competitor (Lolth). Consulting some of heř clerical servants, Zuggtmoy decided that Elemental Evil would have more appeal than a cult dedicated to her beloved fungi. Recruiting was not difficult, and soon the rudiments of the Temple of Elemental Evil were flourishing. The beauty of the quadrate system was obvious to Zuggtmoy; each type of EleJ?1en­ tal Evil would appeal to a broader base of servants and followers, and certain ones would actually serve her directly. The four separate elemental temples would also com­ pete, spreading evil more effectively and alsg serving to check one another if any grew too powerful-Zuggtmoy, of course, desiring to retain all real power in her own grasp. The appeal of elemental destruction and demonaic aid attracted many malign and twisted c;reatures to the Temple, and it grew ever more rapidly. At this crucial juncture, luz himself requested an audience with Zuggtmoy. The Old One, long ruling a realm of his own, perceived the Temple of Elemental Evil and Zuggtmoy as tools to be used for his own ends. Help the demoness and her Temple to grow, aid their ravaging of the lands around, and they would surely draw down the hosts of Good from Veluna, Furyondy, and everywhere else nearby. This drew foes away from his own border immediately, and at the very worst weakened them to some degree. If Good triumphed, the luz would not be harmed, for the Old One could retire to Dorakaa, none the worse for having spent time and effort helping Zuggt- moy. If the battle were a draw, then Iuz could move his own armies down to Furyondy to put the hosts of <;ood in a vise of irresistable Evil. If the Temple triumphed, then he could call upon Zuggtmoy to repay his aid and make sure that Iuz, not the Horned Society, benefited most from the territorial acquisitions in Furyondy. Also, a strong Chaotic Evil ally against the growing power of the Horned Society could be most useful. Zuggtmoy, in turn, saw the advantage of having Iuz' magic to aid her in building her fortress and expanding her domain in the Flanaess. Having just learned of the sharp check dealt to Lolth in her plans to wreak Evil, the Lady of Fungi agreed to accept Iuz as an (almost) equal in the Temple. She saw him as an excellent weapon, especially use­ ful against the Horned Society once she had absorbed most of Veluna and Furyondy. She would then encourage luz to crush the might of the Society, and she would be left as the great Evil power in the Flanaess, ready to absorb the Wild Coast and Pomarj, while the rumps of luz and the Horned ones served as buffers in the north and east. Her hordes, in turn, could concentrate on the hateful elves and dwarves to the west. ... And so the alliance formed, and actually worked, but saved not the Temple. Zuggt­ moy was bound in its dungeons, but luz remained free (just as he had planned). After the mighty magicks had been wrought to bind Zuggtmoy-powers which most certainly involved great wizards, high priests, and deities-luz determined to 29 occasionally return to the Temple in hopes of gaining advantage for his past efforts. If he could somehow free Zuggtmoy, she would certainly be. much in his debt. At the same time, she would be seething with a lust for revenge against those who imprisoned her. It was luz, in fact, who helped the reITI'­ nants of the Temple's followers to remain viable, but he lacked the power to forge them into a useful tool. The weakened elemental temples fought more amongst themselves than with the forces of Good pressing their advantage above. luz, meanwhile, remained more con­ cerned with establishing a following of his ow,n than with the furthering of Zuggtmoy's organization of elemental evil. Some of the latter remained faithful to the demoness, despite their not knowing where she was or how to free her. Some actually turned to Lolth in desperation, for many drow visited the Temple after its fall. Lareth was one who sought to serve both the Temple and Lolth. And although Lolth hated Zuggtmoy's Ele­ mental Evil, she so lusted for power that she accepted such service. Had she not been routed, her dark followers so crippled, much might have come of this. But as it transpired, Loi th could-and can yet-give only encouragement, without physical or magical aid, to those who call on her. The Temple is thus factioned into no less than seven competing groups: four serve Elemental Evil principles, one luz, one Lolth, and one still loyal to Zuggtmoy. Woe to the disloyal should the Lady of Fungi ever regain her power! 0NGiilAL ADVEilTVRJOS REi ilCARJIATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EilTAL EVIL Part 2 : Nulb and the Ruins The Village of Nulb OUTDOOR NOTES A casual look at the area map reveals that, in general, only terrain features are shown. Wilderness encounters of special sorts are not given, for two reasons. First, the length of the material included herein precludes extensive detailing of the outdoor areas. Second, as it is meant for long-term campaigning, it is absolutely necessary for the OM to personalize his or her map to suit the tempo and direction of events in the group milieu. There are two built-up areas shown on the map, and these are dealt with in varying degrees of detail. RANDOM ENCOUNTERS (OUTDOORS) Check for random encounters when the party first approaches Nulb, and whenever they leave. Check about halfway down the road. If at night, check twice. When a group is exploring off the road, check six times per day: morning, noon, afternoon, nightfall, midnight, and pre-dawn. Check only once if the party is traveling by water vessel. If they actually submerge for some reason, check each hour. Likewise, if the river is under observation, check each hour, but not unless there is exposure to attack; crayfish and gar are not observed in most cases, so simply omit any mention of the encounter. You may modify these tables as desired.

The total number depends on the circumstances: Village threatened with destruction 60 Possibly over 1.000 gp loot 40 Minor loot and easy battle prospects 30 Village leaders demand service 20 Party or force to be attacked is Good 10 In addition, 5-30 actual brigands are in Nulb, and turn out if their leaders se the sit­ uation as lucrative enough for their partici­ pation. Whether Tolub's crew (see area 4) is in the village or not, 2-12 additional pirates likewise participate if the rewards seem worthwhile. 0R,iGiilAL ADVEilTV'S REiilCAR!IATED • THE TEDIPLE 0F ELEDIEllTAL EVIL COORDINATED EFFORTS The Evil and Good factions in the village of Nulb are not isolated groups who act ran­ domly and ignore events elsewhere. If one place is attacked, someone is likely to see or hear, and spread the word. A serious com­ bat at the Boatmens' Tavern (area 4), for instance, attracts everyone from the Water­ side Hostel (area 1), the citizenry (including 10-40 militiamen), and Otis (area 2), Y'dey, and Murfles (area 3) as well. The latter three are aware of such reactions, and in most cases do not help even Good individuals­ for that would reveal their true identities and betray their greater purpose. All this is not to say that a silent, swift, and deadly attack upon one place or another is always noticed. But if a noisy or protracted fight takes place, the results might prove unpalatable to those causing the problem. Otis, Y'dey, and Murfles, as agents of Good, must be handled as rational, clever, intelligent, thoughtful individuals. They do nothing foolish, nor offer aid to unproven groups. They will not risk losing their cover identities, let alone their lives, for no pur­ pose. Conversely, their participation in a death-stroke to the Temple (an expedition with purpose, planning, sure goals, and solid chances for success) is logical and rea­ sonable. In short-play each and every character and group as if you yourself were there I MERCENARIES As noted, a handful of men-at-arms are usually in the village, and will serve for pay. Because of the repute of the area, these mer­ cenaries are Evil (Neutral or Chaotic) or Chaotic Neutral. Such types are in the vil­ lage mainly to seek service with some bandit chief or similar person-perhaps even to hire on with a minion of the Temple. When mercenaries are encountered by PCs, deter­ mine alignment as given on Mercenary Table 1. The alignment of a leader, of course, determines the bent of a group. Evil men-at­ arms will serve with your players' charac­ ters, but are most likely seeking to rob, abandon, or betray them, depending on the circumstances. Chaotic Neutral groups are just that-and possibly dangerous through their unpredictability and avarice. If the party is rather on the weak side, you should alter the probabilities for merce­ naries rather than involve Otis, Y'dey, or Murfles. The players would tend to rely too heavily on these NPCs, rather than develop­ ing their own characters' skills. To adjust for a party in need of strengthening, use Merce­ nary Table 2. Assume that each time a PC enters the Waterside Hostel 5-8 such merce­ naries are present. Mercenary Table 1 (Normal) 1-3 Chaotic Evil 4-5 Neutral Evil 6 Chaotic Neutral Mercenary Table 2 (Party in need) 1 Bandits 2-3 Neutral Evil mercenaries 4-6 Neutral mercenaries Leaders Mercenaries are led by a second level fighter, and if more than six are present, by a first level "serjeant" as well. Note that these leaders are not added to the total; they form part of the stated group of 5-8. They do not progress beyond their stated levels. Troop Types Each group of mercenaries always con­ tains the following types of troops and weaponry. Each mercenary has 1-2 daggers as well, usable as either thrown or hand­ held weapons. Light crossbowmen: 2 Spearmen: All remaining men Swordsmen: Leader + Serjeant Armor The leader and serjeant have chain mail and shield (AC 4). Spearmen have ring mail and shield (AC 6). Crossbowmen have leather armor and shield (AC 7, AC 8 while firing). ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING If Otis requests aid, Burne (at Hommlet) assists magic-users, furnishing them with spells for their books at the cost of 1,00 gp per spell level. He offers only the following spells: First level burning hands magic missile protection from evil shield spider climb 31 ventriloquism Second level audible glamer continual light levitate ray of enfeeblement web Third level dispel magic fireball suggestion tongues Furthermore, if Otis happens to be along on an adventure during which the true num­ bers and power of the Temple are revealed, he informs Burne. The latter will, in turn, summon powerful characters from Veluna and Verbobonc. They remain in Hommlet, but aid in training and preparing the adven­ turers to gain levels of experience. Costs are as shown in the AD&D® DUNGEON MAS­ TERS GUIDE, but time is cut by 50% due to concentrated efforts. 0NGiIIAL ADVEIITV'S REiIICAR._IATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EIITAL EVIL .Nulb Encounter Key The village of Nulb is filthy, ramshackle, and still fairly active despite the destruction of the Temple. The buildings are of turf, mud brick, crudely hewn logs, and old tim­ bers from boats. One or two have stone foundations and proper boards, but even these are in need of repair. The inhabitants of the village are boatmen, fishers, herds­ men, farmers, and the like. It is apparent that no one manages to make much of a liv­ ing in Nulb, and as it is such a poor place, it is generally ignored by lords and bandits alike. A small amount of commerce moves along the Low Road, as well as into Nulb from the Velverdyva, as Imeryds Run is wide and deep enough for .the small river vessels to use for offloading cargo and like­ wise embarking it from Nulb, north of the ford there. Only four points in the entire vil­ lage are noteworthy. I. THE WATERSIDE HOSTEL This place is one of the more substantial buildings in Nulb. It has a foundation of field stone and walls of sawn timber, but is nonetheless a scurvy place. Its main trade is in its tavern room, though occasional trav­ elers stop to spend the night. Rich guests have been known to disappear mysteri­ ously. The hostler is a burly fellow with a scarred, pockmarked visage, one eye cov­ ered by a patch. The barkeep is lanky and of greasy appearance, but quite tall. Two slov­ enly wenches and two manservants of surly mein hover about the place. See below for full NPC details. Prices are low, however, being only half those of the Inn of the Welcome Wench in Hommlet. (Round down when fixing costs.) In the daytime, only two or three local peo­ ple can be found in the hostel's tavern room (0 level farmers, laborers, etc.). At night, 14-34 (4d6 + 10) roistering folk can be found in the tavern room (25% villagers, 25 % boatmen or bargefolk, 25% transient band­ its or mercenaries, 25 % river pirates or Temple spies; assume equal chances where two possible types of patrons are given). Hostler: Dick Rentsch, a swashbuckler (Level 5 Fighter); AC 7 (leather armor); hp 39; XP 520 S 17; I 8; W 13; D 15; Co 15; Ch 7 dagger + l; purse with 9 pp, 15 gp, 11 sp; changes to AC 1 if time permits. In his private quarters, Dick has a suit of chain mail + 1, shield + 1, battle axe + 1, a normal longsword, and an iron chest with a poison needle trap on the lock (save or die). The chest, stored under his bed, contains 673 cp, 325 sp, 17 ep, 108 gp, and 46 pp. Dick reports to the Temple's Earth priests. Barman: Wat, a waghalter (Level 3 Assas­ sin); AC 5 (leather); hp 22; XP 241; S 16, I 12, W 6, D 17, Co 16, Ch 7 dagger of venom, purse with 12 cp, 9 sp, 21 gp, and a bloodstone worth SO gp. In his private room, Wat has a shield + 1, elven boots, normal longsword and shortsword, a pair of matched and balanced throwing knives (daggers), and a gold ring set with a fire opal (2,00 gp) secreted in the hem of an old cloak hanging on a peg. Wat serves the Temple's Fire priests. Wench: Dala, a cutpurse (Level 3 Thief), AC 6 (no armor); hp 15; XP 95 S 11 I 11 W 10 D 18 Co 15 Ch 13 Thief abilities: PP 70; OL 48; F/RT 35; MS 37; HS 30; HN 15; CW 87. Carried: dagger (concealed), 1-4 pieces of cheap jewelry (total value 2-12 gp). She often picks pockets. In a small room upstairs, Dala has a phil­ tre of love and a pair of jeweled earrings (worth 700 gp) under a loose floor board, and 87 gp in her mattress. She is Dick Rentsch's lover. Wench: Pearl, a cutpurse (Level 3 Thief), AC 8 (no armor); hp 13; XP 89 S 13 I 14 W 9 D 16 Co 12 Ch 11 Thief abilities: PP 60; OL 38; F/RT 30; MS 27; HS 20; HN 15; CW 87. .Carried: dagger (concealed), 1-4 pieces of cheap jewelry (total value 2-12 gp). She occasionally picks pockets, but usually limits such work to inebriated victims. In a small room upstairs, Pearl has a sil­ ver case (worth 75 gp and adorned with a sapphire worth 1,000 gp) which contains 19 pp. However, the whole is covered with thick dripped wax, topped by a half-burnt candle and seems to be a perfectly normal 32 and worthless candleholder. The coins are likewise imbedded in wax to prevent telltale rattling. Pearl is Wat's paramour. Manservants (2): Both veterans (Level 1 Fight­ ers), hp 8; 7; XP 22; 21; leather armor (will change if time permits); dagger (openly worn); ability scores average; each has a purse with 2-12 sp and 2-8 gp. These men sleep in the loft, where each has stored a suit of chain mail, a shield, a light crossbow with 30 bolts in a case, and a longsword. The manservants are guards, always alert and ready for a brawl or nefari­ ous duties. They work exclusively for the hostler. 2. SMITHY AND STABLE The smith is a very powerful man, with a bushy beard and large hands forever work­ ing some piece of iron. He is assisted by a dull-witted stable 'boy' and a rat-faced young apprentice. Though the smith's main skill is shoeing horses and similar work, he can mend armor and do minor weapons work, and so is kept quite busy. He is usu­ ally seen drinking quietly (though he brawls on occasion) at the Waterside Tavern. Chon, Smith's boy: Level 0 local man, AC 10 (no armor); hp 3; AL NG; XP 8 S 16 I 6 W 8 D 12 Co 14 Ch 10 Carried: dagger, purse with 10 cp, 10 sp, 2 ep, 1 gp Sammy, Apprentice Smith: a Veteran (Level 1 Fighter), AC 4 (chain & shield); hp 8; AL N; XP 18 S 17 I 13 D 8 W 9 Co 15 Ch 10 Carried: dagger, purse with 6 cp, 6 sp, 4 ep, 3 gp Smith: Otis, a man-at-arms ex-mercenary, AC 7 (no armor) or better (see below); hp 100; AL NG; XP 5000 S 18/07 I 15 W 15 D 17 Co 18 Ch 13 Carried: dagger (and hammer in smithy), purse with 1 cp, 4 sp, 7 ep, 2 gp. Languages: Common, Alignment, Elvish, Gnomish, Ogrish, Sprite. Spells (druidical)-detect magic, speak with animals, affect normal fires. In a secret place beneath the old anvil at the rear of his shop, Otis has a suit of chain mail + 2, longsword + 2, and a pouch with 0.aj:GiilAL ADVEilTV'S REi ilCAR_IlATED • THE TElb:PLE 0F ELElb:EilTAL EVI L - . .

0RjGiilAL ADVEil'fV'S REiilCA1'_IlA'fED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EilTAL EVIL 25 gems (a mix of amethysts, chrysoberyls, pearls, and tourmalines, each worth 100 gp). Nearby are his pallet, a chest (contain­ ing clothing and adventuring gear suited to his level), a small table and chair, and an assortment of old but serviceable weapons (including normal longbow, a quiver of 20 arrows with cold-wrought iron heads, shortsword, and cold iron battle axe). The smith is secretly a ranger knight (Level 10), an agent of the King of Furyondy, a Knight Bachelor of Veluna, and formerly a watcher of activity in Hommlet. Otis claims to be an ex-mercenary. His apprentice and 'boy" believe this to be true, though the former (an alert snoop) knows where Otis hides his special equipment. Otis will accompany adventurers to the Temple of Elemental Evil if the opportunity arises. He slays or misleads evil creatures and helps those of Good while not unduly risking his life. After one or two such expeditions, however, he decides that even a Good party must go it alone, as he does not wish to reveal his true identity and purposes-to be certain that some powerful Evil character does not loose the prisoner (as, in the Greyhawk Cam­ paign, did Lord Robilar). This ranger further assists Good characters if in great need. In his guise as a man-at-arms, he asks for a suit of chain mail and a long­ sword, and then substitutes his own magical counterparts. His sword glows only upon his utterance of a secret rune, so the magic upon it may be kept hidden for some time. His "fee" is one equal share of treasure gained. Otis is Neutral Good, and cooperates with Y' dey and Murfles (se area 3,seven special followers­ Murfles (area 3), two giant owls, and four sprites. The owls conceal themselves amidst the thick foliage of a mighty oak nearby. By night, they watch for and report to Otis any activity around the Temple. The sprites are from the nearby area, and are thus very famil­ iar with their surroundings. They make a tem­ porary home in a hollow high up the huge trunk of a nearby lpp tree (quite near the owls' oak), in the small woods to the north of the track between Nulb and the Temple. They watch by day, reporting to Otis on activity around the Temple.

MOTHER SCRENG'S HERB SHOP This dilapidated frame building is well known in the village as the place to go for all sorts of herbs, medicines, and possibly even special draughts of one sort or another. Mother Screng is old and bent, with scraggly gray locks sticking out from beneath the aged shawl she wears all year 'round. Her daughter appears quite old her­ self, so Mother Screng must be venerable. This daughter, Hruda by name, is quite ugly, and it is no wonder that she is an old maid, for her personality matches her looks and her tongue is sharp. Inside the shop are counters and shelves filled with jars, flasks, bottles, boxes, and small drawers. These are stuffed with herbs and like stuff, and various infusions and decoctions made from such. Bunches of vege­ tation of various sorts hang from the rafters or are tossed onto counter tops to dry. The shop has almost every known herb and spice, and even 3 jars of Keoghtom's ointment which Mother Screng sells to any adventurers of Good alignment who are in real need of the magic salve, after having proved themselves in expeditions to the Temple. Mother Screng: An herbmonger (also Can­ oness Y'dey-Level 6 Cleric, XP 3978); AC 9 (no armor) or better (se below); hp 37; AL NG; XP 1072 S 13 I 12 W 17 D 15 Co 16 Ch 13 Carried: club (under the counter), purse with 4 cp, 7 sp, 5 ep, 11 gp. Typical spells: First level: bless, command, cure light wounds, detect evil, protection from evil Second level: augury, detect chan, hold per­ son, know alignment, speak with animals Third level: dispel magic, prayer, remove curse Hruda: Mother Screng's daughter (a.k.a. Murfles, Otis' fellow- adventurer and follower, an elven warrior-footpad, Level 2/2 Fighter/Thief), AC 6 (no armor) or better (see below); hp 12; AL NG; XP 156 S 15 I 9 W 11 D 18 Co 15 Ch 14 Thief abilities: PP 40; OL 49; F/RT 30; MS 34 36; HS 35; HN 15; CW 86. Carried: shortsword (under robe), purse with 9 sp, 5 gp, and 2 pp. Y'dey is the chief cleric of the church of St. Cuthbert in Hommlet, away on this 'sab­ batical'. She has a suit of plate mail + 1, shield + 1, mace + 1, ring of fire resistance, potion of flying, a scroll of 3 cleric spells. (silence 15' radius, neutralize poison, raise deacl) and adventuring gear, all kept in her chambers. The potion, scroll, and equip· ment are in a wardrobe, along with a small locked iron box which holds 50 gems (mostly pearls and a few red spinels, each worth 100 gp) and 10 silver ingots worth 10 gp each. Murfles has a suit of leather armor, adventuring gear, a dagger, longsword, longbow, and quiver with 11 silver-tipped arrows in her chambers. She will lend the arrows to deserving adventurers as needed. A sack with 290 gp lies under a loose floor board. Murfles assists Y'dey and reports to Otis about everything of possible interest. Neither Y'dey nor Murfles goes on any expedition (to the Temple or elsewhere) unless Otis personally asks them to do so, and has a sound reason for it as they are likewise serving Furyondy, Veluna, and the cause of Good by keeping watch on Evil activity at Nulb and the Temple. Both, how­ ever, assist parties of Good alignment and intent. Quiet exploration of the Temple, to discover the state of its forces and their cur­ rent intentions, is of great importance to both of these 'old hags'. A small coop is in the rear of the shop. It holds 6 homing pigeons, which Y'dey uses for communicating with the Archcleric of Veluna. This same information is sent to Furyondy (and then to Veluna and Verbo­ bonc) by way of Otis' regular reports; the pigeons are a back-up system. 4. BOATMENS' TAVERN & NULB MARKET This large old warehouse building houses a small tavern in a back comer. The remainder of the place is both a warehouse and general store. Various items of soft and hard goods are offered here, as well as general provisions and fresh seafood. The Boatmens' Tavern is as cheap as the bar at the Waterside Hostel-and the place is even dirtier and rougher. The room can hold about 30 customers, and any time after 8:00 AM, 7-U village folk and half as many rivermen from elsewhere can be found here, tipping mugs of beer, ale, or wine. 0NGinAL ADVEilTV'S REiilCAR._IlATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EnTAL EVIL Proprietor: Skole, an ex-riverman (and smuggler, also a swashbuckler), Level S Fighter; AC 8 (leather) or 2 (see below); hp 27; AL NE; XP 265 S 16 I 11 W 14 D 10 Co 13 Ch 10 Carried: dagger, topaz and silver ring (worth 300 gp), purse with 8 cp, 3 sp, 7 ep, and 12 gp.

Ruins of Elemental Evil PLAYERS' DESCRIPTION The road leading from Nulb to the Tem­ ple is rutted and spotted with rank weeds-thistles, burrs, thorns, nettles, etc. Some foot and animal traffic has been using the track, but it is not a busy thoroughfare. (Most traffic between these points avoids using the road, so as not to leave a discernable path.) As you approach the Temple area, the vegetation is disconcerting-dead trees with a skeletal appearance, scrub growth twisted and unnaturally colored, all unhealthy and sickly looking or excep­ tionally robust and disgusting. The ruins of the Temple's outer works appear as dark and overgrown mounds of gray rubble and blackish weeds. Skulls and bones of humans and humanoids gleam white here and there amidst the weeds. A grove of some oddly stunted and unhealthy looking usk trees still grows 35 along the northern end of the former Temple compound, and a stump of a tower juts up from the northeast corner of the shattered wall. The leprous gray Temple, however, stands intact, its arched buttresses somehow obscene with their growth of climbing vegetation. Everything surrounding the place is disgusting. The myriad leering faces and twisting, contorted forms writhing and posturing on every face of the Temple 0RjGiilAL ADVEilTV'S REi ilCARJIATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EllTAL EVI L sem to jape at the obscenities they depict. The growth in the compound is rank and noisome. Thoms clutch, burrs stick, and oushed stems either emit foul stench or raise angry weals on exposed flesh. Worst of al, however, is the pervading fear which sems to hang over the whole area-a smothering, clinging, almost tangible cloud of vileness and horror. Sounds sem distorted, either muffled and shrill or unnaturally loud and grating. Your eyes play tricks. You see darting movements out of the comer of your eye, just at the edge of vision; but when you shift your gaze towards such, of course, there is nothing there at all. You cannot help but wonder who or what made the maze of narrow paths through the weedy courtyard. What sort of thing would wander here and there around the ghastly edifice of Evil without shrieking and gibbering and going completely mad? Yet the usual mundane sounds of your travel are accompanied only by the chorus of the winds, moaning through hundreds of Temple apertures built to sing like doomed souls given over to the tender mercies of demonkind, echoed by macabre croaks from the scattered flap­ ping, hopping, leering ravens. There is no doubt; you have come to a place of inefable Evil. Still, it is most cer­ tainly a place for high adventure and untold treasures. It is time to ready spells, draw weapons, check equipment, and set forth into the maze of peril that awaits you. EXTERIOR NOTES (for the DM) The thrown down works and razed build­ ings are shown on the map by X marks. All ground in and around the place is over­ grown by weeds, so observation is restricted to 15 feet in any direction wlth regards to objects of six feet or lesser height, except on the remains of the road and path. In these two areas, weed growth is scattered and shallower. The pale blue uskfruit growing on 'the trees is small, misshapen, and splotched with angry red patches. One in six is poison; the consumer grows sick and dies in 24 hours, the first effects of the poison being a loss of one point of strength about two hours after eating. An additional point of strength is lost each hour thereafter, with zero strength bringing coma. Three areas of the Outer Works are described in detail: A. Tower; B. Building Ruins; C. Temple.

Some general details can be discerned from a distance, but do not 36 emphasize the Tower's existence to the play­ ers. If the party has not yet slain any ravens, read the following description; omit it oth­ erwise, proceeding to the other details if the tower is closely investigated. The jagged stub of a large tower stands up from the razed walls. Two small black birds are perched on the tower top, about 25 feet up. An illusion on the tower top makes all creatures thereon appear smaller. These birds are, in fact, two of the 16 giant ravens which live here and serve as guards and sen­ tries for the bandits detailed below. Most ravens are out of sight, roosting on the tim­ bers where the third storey collapsed and broke through the second level. Of course, if the party has slain all the birds, they find none here, only the seemingly deserted tower ruin. One heavy door can be sen, barred and chained shut from the outside. Arrow slits are visible on either side of the door, but peering in reveals only blackness beyond. The bar is a ruse; it can be disengaged from inside. Unless this is done, however, those out· side must break the lock, free the chain, and slide the bar before entering the door. GENERAL NOTES Before you start the following encounter, be sure you are familiar with the Tower Map (Map 4), the occupants, their Defense Strat· egy (given below), and the other Combat Notes given hereafter. Refer to the Tower Map. Four guards are on duty at all times, each peering out of an arrow slit. Note that the two slits at ground level are screened by heavy black felt drap· eries; anyone trying to peer in from outside sees only darkness. Entering by the door, one sees low stone walls, a little over waist height, leading from the exterior wall to support columns. These serve to channel entrants through a passage some eight feet wide. The tower cannot be entered from above; the second and third storeys have collapsed, forming an impassable jumble. The ravens which roost above croak a warning to the guards if intruders are sighted. The tower interior is lit by a dozen torches in sconces. 0NGi ITAL ADVEITTV'S REi ITCAR._IlATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEllTAL EVIL This tower is the residence of 26 brigands.

If the party's approach is seen by either guards or ravens, all but two torches are immediately extinguished, and brigands armed with missile weapons move to cover the door. The balance of the men form a shield and spear wall, two ranks deep, about five feet northeast of the entryway. Behind the missile troops, one first and one third level brigand take station on each flank. Behind the ranks, the sixth level leader and one first level brigand stand ready to move as the need arises (left, right, or upwards). The two guards on the stair­ way, at their arrow slits, remain in position to shoot at targets of opportunity. As soon as the party attacks the door, the remaining torches in the main room are extinguished. Lanterns in the two interior rooms remain alight, not being normally detectable. As soon as the door is opened, and invaders (characters) are illuminated or silhouetted, the brigands attack with arrows, bolts, and spears. If the intruders flee, they are fired upon again. If they advance, the brigands use flanking fire while their forward line engages. Combat Notes As soon as combat begins, give the bri­ gands the following advantages (assuming that the party was observed, and that they forced entry through the door): a. Only the intruders (party) can be sur­ prised. b. The brigands automatically gain initia­ tive in the first round. c. Attacking illuminated or silhouetted tar­ gets, the brigands gain a + 2 bonus to all "to hit" rolls for all missiles (including arrows, bows, and hand-hurled weap­ ons; each round, this should affect six arrow shots, two heavy crossbow bolts, four light crossbow bolts, and ten spears). d. A -1 penalty applies to all the invaders' "to hit" rolls until the tower interior is illuminated, and the brigands gain a cor­ responding + 1 bonus for their familiar­ ity with the dark area. After the initial round of missiles, the par­ ty's actions determine the lieutenants' actions: If the party flees, they reload crossbows. 37 If the party hesitates, they pick up spears. If the party enters, they get morning stars. Serjeants either grab extra spears to hurl or draw swords. Guard-archers continue missile fire. Light crossbowmen reload if possible, or drop their crossbows and grab battle axes for melee. Front rank brigands draw swords and advance one pace, while rear ranks level their second (long) spears and move up. The sixth level leader and his first level serjeant ready their hurling weapons for fast release, followed by movement to any threatened area. If the party hurls oil or otherwise attacks with a serious threat, the leader moves rap­ idly to the south-central pillar and releases a chain there. This triggers a fall of several hundredweight of rocks and loose stone. Each victim in range (the entry area bounded by the door and low walls) takes 1- 12 points of rockfall damage, is stunned for the following round, and blinded by a chok­ ing cloud of dust which settles in two rounds. Meanwhile, the brigand leader dashes to his room (area 3), slams and bars the door, and enters the secret trap door. lOWER AREA DESCRIPTIONS I. MAIN ROOM There is little in the place other than the rude tables, benches, chairs, and stools. Heaps of old blankets and brown cloaks lie by the walls, and several sacks near them are filled with foodstuffs. On the tables are bottles of cheap wine (mostly consumed), knucklebones, dirty plates and mugs, and nothing else. The brigands obviously live in the place, eating, sleeping and gaming while awaiting further raids. If the rafters are examined, various smoked meats, sausages, and bags of onions and herbs can be seen. All told, the provisions here can supply all the bri­ gands for a full week. Under the ascending stone spiral staircase are five large barrels. The two largest contain water; the next two, beer. The smallest (about 40 gallons) is nearly full of wine-the same sour, cheap stuff on the tables. A bale of blankets is stuffed under the stairs, evidently loot from some hapless merchant. 0NGiilAL A.DVEilTVRJSS REiilCAR.IlATED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEllTA.L EVIL 2. NORTH ROOM This place quarters the two lieutenants and the three sergeants. In addition to the five rough beds, the room contains a round table, three stools, a chest of drawers with a lantern atop it (and nothing but old clothes and the like inside), and a padlocked iron­ bound oak chest. Inside the latter is a potion of healing, a sack of 300 ep, a jeweled dag­ ger (worth 250 gp), and four bolts of silk (worth 10-60 gp each). 3. NORTHEAST ROOM This is the leader's private chamber. He has a comfortable bed heaped with quilts and pillows, a table and two chairs, a small desk and stool, a chest of drawers, and a padlocked iron box. On the table are a few pewter dishes, a bottle (full of good brandy), and some slightly wrinkled apples. Inside its fold-down top, the desk holds some quills, an inkwell, and several sheets of parchment. One sheet bears a list of pos­ sible victims (including the jeweller at Hom­ mlet). The other sheets are blank, but if the correct one is held up to a strong light, a map is revealed, showing the secret tunnel out of the tower-and into the third level of the Temple dungeon, if entry is desired. The chest of drawers conceals a short sword with a topaz pommel (total value 500 gp), a suit and hooded cloak of brown vel­ vet trimmed with fur (200 gp), plus normal clothing and odds and ends. The iron chest is trapped with poison nee­ dles, which project to either side of the lid when it is raised. Inside are 384 cp, 556 sp, 106 ep, 277 gp, and 91 pp. One flagstone can be lifted to reveal a bronze ring, set into the floor. The pivot is undetectable by normal sight, and the flag­ stone locks into place. It is mechanically linked to the trap door beneath, which is counterbalanced to raise and lower with ease and but little noise. If the trap door is closed from below, the flagstone also closes neatly. The shaft below is about three feet square, and bronze rungs lead 30 feet down to a small chamber. In this lO'x 15' room are the following: Small, flat silver box (worth 125 gp) con­ taining a jeweled necklace (2,400 gp) Cloak of eli-enkind, hanging on a peg by the entrance of the passage leading to the west Large pouch with a leather strap for shoul­ der slinging, containing 50 tiny pearls (base 10 gp each) and a leather bag (con­ taining 50 pp) Longbow and quiver with nine arrows + 1 Locked bronze coffer containing three potions speed, extra healing, and water breathing) Locked iron box, containing 80 gp and 200 ep The fleeing leader immediately dons or picks up all but the last two items. If time per­ mits, he drinks or takes the potion of extra healing. If he hears pursuit, he probably (75% chance) drinks the potion of speed. He proba­ bly (75 % ) ignores the potion of water breath­ ing. He then runs down the west passage and out to escape. If successful, he visits Nulb at night and then leaves the area on horse, sek­ ing better things in Dyvers or somewhere across the Nyr Dyv. 4. ESCAPE TUNNEL This five-foot-wide passage is hewn from the bedrock underlying the Temple com­ plex, evidently following a natural fissure in the limestone. It bears generally west, though it has many curves. In places it is not worked at all, and there the width varies from four to eight feet. About 540 feet along, it opens into a small natural cave. The north wall of this 40' oval chamber is marked by a three-foot wide opening. (A secret entrance to Dungeon Level Three, area 335, is concealed in the eastern portion of the south wall by a balanced, pivoting stone slab. The passage concealed is three feet wide and leads 600 feet south, slanting downwards rather steeply. At its end is a 10' wide stone passage east, turning south in 30 feet; see the Dungeon Level map and key.) The narrow north passage leads north and gradually west, ascending slowly over about 200 feet. It then turns due north again for another 100 feet, where the limestone gives way to clay walls shored up by tim­ bers for 50 feet. The escape tunnel mouth is at the side of an abandoned dry well. A small heavy door there is set back from the side of the shaft and painted dull brown, barred from the inside. A short ladder can be set up inside the shaft, enabling the escaping party to gain a series of ascending ledges which lead to the top. The ladder is inside the tunnel. (The position of this exit is indicated by an X on the large area map, deep in the 38 woods north of the Temple, towards the Velverdyva.) Near the tunnel exit are a deserted cottage and a ramshackle barn. This whole area is screened by surrounding trees. In the barn are six light horses, which belong to the bri­ gand leaders. They are fed and exercised each night in most cases. B. BUILDING RUINS This area lies northwest of the Temple, concealed by some dense woods to the south and southeast. As with all of the razed works of the Temple, the outlines of this place are dis­ cernable even though the whole is tum­ bled, burned and broken. Broken bricks, bits of charred beams, and broken plas­ ter are heaped in the shell of the lower storey. Parts of a narrow outside stair­ way on the west side can be seen through the rubble. The stairs lead down to a dark, small opening, through which a person might crawl. There is no evidence of heavy traffic here; no footprints of men or beasts, save a few rat tracks. The boxed space on the map indi­ cates the stair and hole, where a foolish adventurer might gain access to what remains of the building's cellar. As soon as anyone crawls down in, 12 giant rats scurry forth and attack. Note that all shield and dexterity protection is lost here; the area is too cramped and cluttered. Rats attack crawling victims with a + 4 bonus "to hit:· If retreat is immediate, the rats do not follow.

Rats, Giant (12): AC 7; MV 12 #; HD 112; hp 3 each; #AT 1; D 1-3; SA disease; XP 10 each The cellar contains nothing but litter and filth. If an old mat in the northeast comer is lifted, a trapdoor leading to a hidden wine cel­ lar is discovered. A short flight of steps leads to this 20' square room, containing dozens of barrels and a rack of earthenware flasks. The barreled wine is cheap-drinkable but sour. The 68 stoneware containers al hold very excellent wine; each is worth 1-6 gp, or 3 gp each if the lot is sold off at once. A keg of very ancient brandy is also hidden here, and will fetch the sum of 40 gp in Hommlet or any place other than Nulb. 0RiGinAL A.DVEilTVR]OS REi ITCAR._IlATED • THE TEDIPLE 0F ELEDIEnTA.L EVI L C. THE TEMPLE FIRST IMPRESSIONS Careful inspection of the structure, including a trek around its exterior, reveals the following. The oddly peaked and gabled roof seems to set the viewer's teeth on edge. The grue­ some visages glaring from the walls are everywhere-as projecting ornaments, as supports, in bas-relief, etc. The place is huge. It extends over 450 feet north and south, and is nearly 450 feet across at its widest. The walls rise about 30 feet, supported by arched buttresses and many pilasters. The roof peak is about 20 feet higher than the walls, making the whole edifice no less than 50 feet tall. Only three doors are visible, all at the south end of the Temple. The narrow win­ dows appear to be barred. SEALED DOORS Four pairs of huge bronze doors are located within the Temple areas. The first pair is the Grand Entrance (Upper Works area 1), and will be encountered early in the adventure. Other doors are within the dungeon at areas 145, 210, and 352. Each pair of doors is held fast by huge iron chains, and all cracks are sealed with soft iron. Graven upon each portal are mag­ ical runes which glow in a silvery radiance. These portals are the binding forces which even now confine the demoness Zug­ gtmoy to the dungeon (Level Three). If one or more pairs of doors are sundered, Zuggt­ moy gains some freedom and additional powers; se area 353 for detailed notes, as well as the monster description in Appendix B. Show diagram 10 to the players when­ ever a character approaches within 10 feet of any pair of these doors. The intruder must make a saving throw vs. spells, apply­ ing a -2 penalty to the roll, to resist the pow­ erful permanent antipathy magic represented by the silvery runes. Failure to save means that the character cannot approach within 10 feet of those doors, and is likewise forever blocked from the other portals of like dweomer found in the dungeon. The victim cannot even bear to look upon the silvery runes. If the saving throw succeeds, another must still be made whenever the character 39 T © 1' 0zjGiITAL ADVEil'f'VRJ;S REiITCAR_IlA'f'ED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EllTAL EVIL again comes within 10 feet of the same por­ tals, or of like portals elsewhere. Any fail­ ure to save produces the effect noted above. If the doors are successfully approached, the intruder may try to break them down. However, this is an impossible task to normal strength and most magic.

GRAND ENTRANCE The bronze doors of the entry (23 ' high, 20 ' wide) are held fast by huge iron chains, and all cracks are sealed with soft iron. Graven upon these massive valves are runes. You note that the writing glows and seems to burn with silvery radiance, making your eyes teary. Show diagram called "Entrance Runes," to the players. Make a Saving Throw vs. Spells for each character, applying a -2 pen­ alty. A major casting of an antipathy spell has been made permanent upon the portal. Each creature within 10' is affected unless the noted saving throw is successful. All who fail will shun the doors and will not look upon the runes. If all fail, take back the players' rune sheet. Read the following description to those examining other areas. Those of you not examining the main entry have noted that the vile stained glass windows of the place are intact. You can enter by breaking the main door, or you can check the smaller bronze­ wood doors around the corners to the east and west. (Bronzewood is a dense, very hard wood, tougher than oak.) Though these side doors are heavy and thick, both can be broken open. Each is locked and barred, but 50 points of damage effects entry. The windows are high and too narrow to permit passage to a man in armor. Each is barred and spiked with bronze. 2. VESTIBULE The floor of this area is reddish brown slate-like stone squares, each about 2 feet square. The walls are plastered and painted with scenes befitting the nature of the Temple-disgusting acts, killing, torture, enslavement, robbery, thievery, and unspeakable things. The creeds of the worshippers here are all too evident. Evil is flaunted and lionized. Dim light filters through the stained glass win­ dows, casting revolting colors upon the greenish stones of the floor to the north. In that direction you can see the nave of the Temple. The pillars to either hand 0R,jGi ilAL A.DVEil'fV'S REi ilCAR_IlATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EllTA.L EVIL are of a pinkish mineral, shot through with worm-colored veins. Their arches lead to an unremarkable pair of lesser side aisles. The columns supporting the archways, as well as the arches themsel­ ves, are worked in bas relief. As with the frescoes in the entryway, the scenes here are ineffable, vile, filthy. It is probable that this area was reserved for the lowli­ est of worshippers. The area beyond is better lit and more open, though it also has more of the nauseating pinkish pil­ lars supporting the roof high overhead. 3. CENTRAL ALTAR The pillars here are white marble, veined with ugly red. The altar block of pinkish white marble is roughly oval something over 7 fet long by 5 feet wide. Its top has a hollowed out portion resembling a human form, with legs apart and arms away from the body. This depression is stained a darker color than the rest. Just north of the altar is a circular, marble-lined pit-a well of sorts-20 feet in diameter. Shards of broken crystal vesels lie about the well, near the altar, and scattered about the floor. A crystal knife with a broken blade lies atop the stone block. Careful examination of the well reveals a one-foot wide ledge beginning 15 feet from the mouth of the shaft. It circles the north­ ern face of the well, leading to narrow, steep steps which spiral down clockwise from the east. The shaft is 85 feet deep. If characters descend here, see Dungeon Level One (area 131) and Dungeon Level Two (area 210). 4. EAST ALTAR The thick stone columns here are deep green, with blood-red striations. The paving blocks are mossy green, with a circular dais-like area about 20 feet in diameter in the center part of the wing. Continue only if PCs move in for closer examination. The dais is two-tiered; each rises about 18 inches, the inner being 14 feet in diam­ eter, thus forming a three feet wide step along the rim of the lower tier. The lower disc is greenish black stone; the upper, blackish green. The center of this altar is a depression about eight feet across, filled with scummed-over black liquid. Several pieces of smashed shells are scat­ tered around the area, along with a bro­ ken bronze knife. The black liquid is merely dirty water, six feet deep. If the pool is dragged, a small and delicate skeleton is discovered at the bot­ tom, the remains of the last sacrifice. 4a. EAST VESTRY This area was apparently a vestry. Bits of broken altar service are present here also, with a broken trident and pieces of tom, scorched robes of a moss-green hue. Other rubble includes several smashed benches, a small broken table, and a thrown-down wardrobe with one side kicked in and the doors torn off. A flight of stairs descends to the southwest. Under the wardrobe lie three moss-green robes, lined with black satin. Each has a cowl. All are soiled but otherwise in good condition, but are obviously of little worth. If the stairs are used, refer to Dungeon Level One, southeast corner (area 109a). 5. WEST ALTAR The supporting pillars in this wing are sandstone, resting on a red slate floor. Bits of broken pottery and sharp bits of rock cover the floor here, making walk­ ing about a risky business. The stump of a granite monolith, and chunks of brownish-red rock around its base, indi­ cate that the altar was violently assaulted and destroyed. A few links of bronze chain, a twisted manacle, and a bronze­ wood maul with a snapped haft add to the impression that the enemies of the Temple who did this must have found the altar very hateful indeed. Sa. WEST VESTRY This seems to be a vestry. A broken rhondite bowl and ewer lie in a corner, apparently flung in anger and now shat- 41 tered and useless. The interior of each is caked with a dry brown substance. Pieces of furniture are also scattered about, as are the tom remains of some brown garments and three stubs of brown candles. A flight of stairs descends to the southeast. Two of the brown robes are a bit frayed but intact. The candles are normal, each about three inches long. The steps lead down to Dungeon Level One, southwest corner (area 109a). 6. SMALL DOOR This door opens into a small vestry. Pieces of broken glass and splinters of crystal lie scattered within. Someone evi­ dently made a fire in the far corner, as bits of charred wood and cloth lie on the floor, and the rafters overhead are black­ ened with soot. A pile of robes, once ivory-colored, lie in the center of the room. They are soiled and stained with excrement. If the party looks carefully overhead, a bit of whitish color can be seen amidst the rafters ten feet above. This is an intact ivory robe, with cowl, edged and embroidered with reddish-pink whorls and lined with pale blue satin. 7. GRAND STAIRCASE A flight of steps, 20 feet wide and each step broad and tall, delves down to the north. The stone is a dull gray, but flecks of color-white, blue, red, green, and black-dot its surface. To the north of the staircase is a stone railing, with supports of white, brown, and green stone alternating; its upper portion is cinnebar. The floor beyond is paved with three-foot squares of highly polished red granite. The square columns of some type of yellowish stone are carved in bas relief, and painted to show scenes of fire and suffering with demonaic creatures leering on. 0NGiIIAL A.DVEII'fV'S REiIICAR._IIA'fED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EIITA.L EVIL If PCs proceed down the flight of steps, they come to a 10' landing and a pair of mas­ sive double doors which exactly duplicate those at the entrance (area #1). These are sealed with soft iron, chained, padlocked, and likewise bear the silvery glowing warn­ ing glyphs. The permanent antipathy is also here, requiring the same saving throw, again with a -2 penalty. However, those who failed the saving throw at the entrance are not here entitled to another; they auto­ matically shun and refuse to look at the runes. Those who succeeded at first but fail here are always affected by antipathy when­ ever any identical set of runes is confronted. If the party eventually breaks open these doors, they enter Dungeon Level One, area 145. 8. HIGH ALTAR A huge bronze vessel chased with copper stands here. Its six legs hold it slightly more than a foot above the floorstones. The basin-like pot is eight feet in diame­ ter. Its bottom is filled with old charcoal. bits of blackened bone, and undefinable lumps. A piece of chain still hangs over this altar, and evidently others similar once also hung there, but their bronze links were broken, and short pieces lie on the floor around the area. The altar's rim is dented and cut, as if struck by many hard blows. 9. EAST DOOR This portal is finely carved, but most of the vile and obscene work has been hacked and chopped so as to efface its evil. Beyc;md is another vestry, a cham­ ber nearly 30 feet wide and 60 feet long. It once must have been the scene of debauched revels, for the remains of great couches, tables, and padded chairs are strewn about. Charcoal and several broken barrels lie nearby. A stack of res­ inous faggots near the door seem to be the only things not broken or disarrayed. Amidst the litter are several skeletons, probably human. One wears the tattered remains of a scarlet robe. Behind the lengths of wooden faggots is a small cupboard, set into the wall. Within it are two silk robes of bright crimson, with skulls embroidered in gold thread on the front and back. Each is cowled and lined with lavender silk. IO. DAIS AND THRONE The dais extends south into the Temple, forming a circular area. The floor, steps, and walls are black basalt, highly pol­ ished and gleaming. Four steps lead to the upper platform, and upon it is a great throne of purplish basalt, with leering demon faces and carved grinning skulls. Above the throne, the following words in the common tongue are chiseled into the curving wall: STU eW0."tf &RXJN m ,_ / ' THE POWER OF ELEMENTAL DEATH BRINGS MORTALS LOW BUT RAISES THE NAMELESS ONE HIGH The flags upon which the throne sets are ten-foot squares of granite, set in a mosaic pattern: Sketch or describe the pattern in detail for the players. H detected, note that the per­ vading evil is stronger here than elsewhere. A faint dweomer also radiates from the entire area. The huge throne is carved of solid stone, immobile, and cannot be destroyed by any­ thing but disintegrate or wish. Other spells, including those which affect rock or stone, have no effect. The throne can be ordered to sink to the Greater Temple (Dungeon Level Three, area 352). Only a limited wish or greater spell can detect this movement capability. The possesor of the Orb of Elemental Death (Dungeon Level Three, area 322) knows how to operate the throne merely by gazing upon it (magically becoming aware of the command words to make it lower or rise) and can control the throne by sitting on it while holding the Orb. The throne can otherwise be activated by a wish, or by the following procedure. The user must step on the four color slabs directly before the throne, in proper order-brown, white, gren, red-and then speak the name of Zuggtmoy. The throne thereafter sinks to area 340 when anyone sits upon it. I Rff ;1£ _BYDW;t VEiN ^ /'t ǖ ' ' I 42 0RjGi IIAL ADVEIITVRJ:S REiIICAR._IIATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EllTAL EVIL Part 3 : Dungeons of Elemental Evil The Temple dungeons are a busy place, for the underground is still alive with followers of the defeated cult. They are engaged in various strugles amongst themselves, forgetting the common enemy Good. A few individuals and groups still strive to unite the factious adher­ ents of Zuggtmoy and Elemental Evil; most, however, sek to place themselves at the head of the conjoined group. Because of this rivalry and internal strife, adventurers can fairly eas­ ily penetrate the Temple dungeons, whether disguised or not. This is not to say that attacks won't often be made upon the party, regardless of any dis­ guise! For example, characters wearing the robes of the priests and servants of Elemental Iiarth wil likely be attacked by the other thre elemental groups (if they perceive the party to be weak) or by other bands dwelling beneath the Temple. Another benefit of the power strug­ gle is that no concerted effort to fre Zuggtmoy has ben mounted. Al of this wil become clearer and more detailed as you read through the encounter explanations for each level. STANDARD CORRIDORS Unles noted otherwise, corridors are of dresed stone blocks or worked from the natural lime­ stone (or granite, in the lower depths). Walls and floors are smooth and polished wherever possible. The 10' wide corridors have gothic arches, peaking at about 17' height. The 20' and 30' passages and spaces have roman arches, about 30' tall. Unless otherwise described, doors are of oak, homwood, or bronzewood. Each is about thre inches thick, bound with bronze, and set with a large ring on each side. Cresets and sconces are along the walls, and unlit torches rest in most of the latter. In 10' wide corridors, sconces are at 10' inter­ vals. Cresets in wider passages are at 30' inter­ vals. Both are stagered left, right, left, right (etc.), and unlit unless specified. STAIRS All stairways are steep, with one-foot risers. The large one is of polished stone and specif­ ically detailed (area 148 et al.). Small ones are hewn from solid rock. Though not espe­ cially old, the stairs are already worn from the passing of many feet. VENTILATION Drafts and less noticeable air curents exist aplenty in the Temple dungeons. The builders worked many small vents and air shafts into the place to assure proper ventilation. Rooms are thus usually warmed by braziers. Torch smoke does not linger near ceilings, let alone at lower levels or in corridor or chamber. Strange odors and odd noises are borne on gusts of air. The hollow, echoing underground ways are rife with musty, damp, feral, foetid, and more noisome scents. MAP NUMBERING Due to the size of the whole complex, the encounter areas are coded, rather than num­ bered sequentially. The first digit indicates the Dungeon Level. Area 1 of Level 1 becomes 101; area 29 of level 2, 229; and so forth. AREA DESCRIPIIONS All DM notes are arranged in order of their probable use. Some areas also contain boxed information to be read to the players. Many encounters involve immediate combat, and the area descriptions are then revealed after the melee. In general, read the full contents of each encounter before starting it, to be sure that all the details are properly used and revealed in their proper sequence. The standard abbreviations of PH, DMG, UA, MMl, MM2, and FF are used (with page numbers) whenever these AD&D game references are needed-the PLAYERS HANDBOOK, DUNGEON MASTERS GUIDE, UNEARTHED ARCANA, MONSTER MANUAL (1), MONSTER MANUAL II, and FIEND FOLIO(tm) Tome, respectively. PRISONERS When human and demi-human prisoners are found and rescued (i.e. taken out of the dungeon), the XP value given for each should be applied to the party's total, as if they were defeated monsters. Conversely, if the prisoners are slain, the characters Jose triple the XP values given. Deduct the amounts from the other awards earned. If such prisoners are simply turned loose in the dungeon, no XP award is earned, but no deductions apply. Experience point values of other prisoners are also given. For monsters of the same general alignment as the majority of the party. treat them as above. If otherwise, award no XP if they are slain, and deduct triple the XP value if they are turned loose in the dungeon. 43 TREASURE Adventurers may find many coins and gems herein, and such wil be fairly easy to remove and spend. A base value is given for each gem found loose; roll ldlO for each gem recovered to check for increase or decrease of worth beyond the noted value (DMG, page 26). Jew­ elry should likewise be checked using ld8, as explained on the same page. Note, however, that not all of the treasure is cash. A typical assortment of potions, scrolls, and other magical treasures are present. Furthermore, many common but finely crafted accessories-serving sets, plates and cups, tapestries, and the like­ are quite valuable, though not quite as immediately negotiable. And for the excep­ tionally industrious, even normal armor and weapons abound to such a degree that, assuming half book value as the resale price, nearly 10,000 gp worth of such items can be taken from the Temple's inhabitants! RECRUITING All factions of the Temple are active in this crucial area. Agents roam near and far to bring all sorts of evil humans and human­ oids into service. River pirates and brigands are major sources. Humanoids come from all quarters. Any group of humans or small humanoids within the dungeon is able to replace its losses (to adventurers) at the rate of one per day. Larger humanoids (3 + 1 or more Hit Dice) can replace one each three days; monsters can replace their numbers at the rate of one per week. If the Temple forces are not heavily pressed by the party, they actually grow at the rates given above. Note, however, that once the leaders of a group are 2liminated, neither they nor their forces can be repaired. ZUGGTMOY BOUND The demoness is imprisoned is a room of Dungeon Level Thre, and cannot fre herself. Four huge bronze gates exist within the dungeon complex, the first found at the Grand Entrance (area 1), the others described in areas 145, 210, and 340. H the lowest pair of valves (340) is destroyed, Zugtmoy is fre to roam areas 339-353. If the gates at 210 are opened as well, she is fre to roam the second and third dungeon levels. If the gates of area 145 are fur­ ther sundered, she can also roam dungeon levels one and four. If all the gates are destroyed, Zuggtmoy is completely fred. 0NGiIIAL ADVEfftV'S REi IICAR._IIATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EIITAL EVIL GOALS The fourth level of the dungeon is the true climax to the whole campaign. The PCs must be strong enough to adventure there, and to enter the Elemental Nodes (partial planes). These areas are challenges, of course, but they are testing grounds of the fitness of those who seek to slay Zuggtmoy. If the PCs are careless on the fourth level and bring Iuz to the scene, only the inter­ vention of St. Cuthbert himself will save them from certain death and utter destruc­ tion. The factions of the Temple- reflecting the true spirit of Chaotic Evil- should suf­ fice to enable Good characters to win through, to both the Elemental Nodes and the prison of Zuggtmoy. Power comes in overthrowing the denizens of the Greater Temple; the ability to beard Zuggtmoy in her lair comes from the magic and weapons found in the Elemental Nodes. The anticli­ max comes when the party finally reaches the portion of the third level wherein Zuggt­ moy is bound. As a final note, you might find it interest­ ing to have each gem taken from the Throne of Zuggtmoy allow entry to and exit from one plane of the Abyss. This assumes, of course, that you desire to develop such areas. (This is a tall order, but it can cer­ tainly make an interesting campaign. See module Q-1 Queen of the Demonweb Pits for direction as to what an Abyssal Plane can be like.) With or without such develop­ ment, it is strongly suggested that you place this campaign within some sort of devel­ oped background - the WORLD OF GREYHAWK"' Fantasy World Setting being the natural one, as this work was drawn from it. Your own can be made to serve as well, with a bit of work. I certainly hope that you and your players find this exten­ sive module an interesting and enjoyable scenario, one which offers challenge and opportunity while heightening your own heroic fantasy campaign! CLUES Try to encourage players to gather knowl­ edge as well as treasure, to maximize the fruits of the adventure. In area 216, characters may find a scroll bearing a short and cryptic poem. For your reference, this note refers to the contents of area 334. The recovery of Fragarach can be of great importance not only to this scenario but to the larger campaign events in progress. As the key to final succes against Zuggt­ moy hinges on the recovery of the Orb of Golden Death (described in Appendix D), the following poem should be introduced at a con­ venient point. The exact method is left to the OM. After any dungeon level is entered, if any Neutral player character revisits the Jaroo, the Druid of the Grove in Hommlet (for shelter, advice, etc.), he may bring out an old parch­ ment bearing the clue. A Lawful Good charac­ ter visiting the Church of St. Cuthbert (in Hommlet) for similar reasons can likewise receive the poem, by means magical or mun­ dane. (Of course, such a character could not actualy employ the Orb, so this route is not optimum.) At last resort, if PCs lack the opportunity for such contacts or fail to gather enough background information, you might introduce the clue in a dream, simply reciting it to one or more players as you se fit. 44 The Two united, in the past, a Place to build, and spells to cast. Their power grew, and took the land and people round, as they had planned. A key without a lock they made of gold and gems, and overlaid with spells, a tool for men to wield to force the powers of Good to yield. But armies came, their weapons bared, while evil was yet unprepared. The Hart was followed by the Crowns and Moon, and people of the towns. The Two were split; one got away but She, when came the judgment day, did break the key, and sent the rocks to boxes four, with magic locks. In doing so, She fell behind as He escaped. She was confined among Her own; her very lair became her prison and despair. The Place was ruined, torn apart and left with chains around the heart of evil power-but the key was never found in the debris. He knows not where She dwells today. She set the minions' path, the way To lift Her Temple high again With tools of flesh, with mortal men. Many now have gone to die in water, flame, in earth, or sky. They did not bear the key of old that must be found-the orb of gold. Beware, my friend, for you shall fall unless you have the wherewithal! to find and search the boxes four and then escape forevermore. But with the key, you might succeed in throwing down Her power and greed. Destroy the key when you are done and then rejoice, the battle won. 0NGiilAL ADVEilTV'S REi ilCAR..IlATED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEllTAL EVI L Dungeon Level One RANDOM ENCOUNTERS Roll d % once per tum and refer to the fol­ lowing chart.

ARMORY This plain chamber is filled with wooden racks for various spears, pole arms, and smaller weapons. The walls have many pegs indicating where other weapons and shields once hung. All that remains now are broken weapons, sundered shields, and ruined coats of mail. Several skeletons, both human and gnoll, lie scattered here· and there, as well as odd skulls and bones. Cobwebs hang in places; if any creatures have been here, visits are not frequent. A close examination of bones reveals teeth marks. Many bones are cracked, and the marrow chewed out. No treasure is here, nor anything else of value. 102. ARMORY Se area 101 for a general description. In the comer to the southwest, under several wooden shafts splintered and tossed aside, is a quiver of 17 usable arrows. 103. PILLARED HALL One hundred pounds of presure on the floor at a point five feet in from the entry triggers a delayed-action mechanism. The pressure point limit is shown by X marks on the map. One round after this is trigered, a heavy barred grate drops and seals the doorway. Two harpies roost atop the two central eastern pillars, having special niches cut into the eastern faces 34 feet above the floor. When the grate crashes down, the harpies start singing. After one round, they cease 45 their song and fly around, attacking any creature that makes a hostile gesture. If sounds of fighting occur here, the occupants of area 104 arrive 1 round later. If there is no such turmoil, these creatures arrive five full rounds after the grate's noisy descent. Harpies (2): AC 7, MV 6 "/15 ", HD 3, hp l6, 12, #AT 3, D 1-3/1-3/1-6, SA singing + charm; XP 193, 181 This 70'x 30' chamber appears deserted. It has probably served as a privy, for the place has a foul fecal odor and filth is scattered here and there on the floor. The columns which support the ceiling 40 ' overhead are thick, four or five feet in diameter. A few skulls and bones lie around the pillar bases. The secret door in the northern portion of the west wall cannot be opened from this area except by the use of appropriate magic. 104. ROOM, 30' x 20' Six ghouls move from here into harpy hall (area 103) if any noise is heard therein, their speed determined by the nature of the sounds (as described above). These foul creatures dwell here in harmony with the harpies and other creatures to the north (in areas 105-107). The harpies are allowed the "fun" of killing charmed and other victims, and get their fair share of the morsels thus obtained. Most of the corpses are then taken by the ghouls for later feasting. Ghouls (6): AC 6, MV 9 ", HD 2, hp 15, 13, 12, 10, 8, 6, #AT 3, D 1-3/1-3/1-6, SA touch paralyzes; XP 95, 91, 89, 85, 81, 77 The door to the west of harpy hall leads to this place. No exits are apparent. The place reeks of carrion, and filth and bones litter the floor. Heaps of old cloth along the walls indicate where the occu­ pants of the place once nested. Old gar­ ments hang from pegs in the wall. A thorough search reveals 187 cp, 81 sp, 5 ep, and 61 gp under the bedding. A suit of elf-sized elfin chainmail hangs under an old cloak on the south wall. (Elven chain may be sold for up to 50 gp, varying by the place and time of sale. It is not normally available for purchase in shops, being highly sought and often reserved for elves, 0zjGiIIAL ADVEII'fV'S REiIICAR!JA'fED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EllTAL EVIL nobles, well-known leaders, and political officials.) 105. ROOM, 30' x 30' Four ghouls lair herein, and ignore all noises in area 103, assuming that their associates will handle whatever occurs. These ghouls attack any humans or demi-humans not clad in Temple robes. Ghouls (4): AC 6, MV 9*, HD 2, hp 14, 13, 10, 9, #AT 3, D 1-3/1-3/1-6, SA touch paralyzes; XP 93, 91, 85, 83 This place is another room abandoned to new tenants. The noisome place is lit­ tered with rags and bones. A broken chest stands in the northwest comer. A door to the west is in the west wall near the south comer. The chest contains old clothing-bits and pieces of brown and tan garments. Under them are 108 cp, 92 sp, 37 gp, and 7 pp. 106. ROOM, 10' x 20' This inner room was evidently the ante­ chamber of some minor functionary, for its walls are plastered and covered with obscene painting. The remains of uphol­ stered furnishings-a couch and four chairs-are still in the room. Some old and battered pewter dishes are heaped upon a small table. Normal doors are placed in the south and east walls. The only items of any value here are the four "pewter" (actually tarnished silver) plates, each worth 30 gp. 107. ROOM, 20' x 20' Two ghasts have chosen this spot as their lair. From it, they direct the ghouls and have grown accustomed to leading an easy exist­ ence. If wounded and hard-pressed, the pair tries to escape via the secret door in the east wall, heading to area 115 for safety. The secret exit works by raising a wall sconce, which causes a five-foot-wide wall section to pivot. This cannot be worked except from inside the ghast's chamber (i.e. being a one-way secret door). Ghasts (2): AC 4, MV 15 *, HD 4, hp 23, 20, #AT 3, D 1-4/1-4/1-8, SA touch paralyzes, stench 10' radius = save vs. poison or suf­ fer -2 "to hit" penalty; XP 282, 270 From the look of this chamber, it was once the sanctuary of some lesser priest of the Temple. The walls are plastered and painted with scenes of evil nature, featuring the earth principle. The rotting remains of a large bed, two couches, and several carved chairs, now broken, tes­ tify that the room was once a comfort­ able place. The whole room reeks horribly. Bones are tossed here and there, and a partially eaten ore carcass lies on the floor near the south wall. No exits are visible, save the normal door to the north. If the bed is moved, a section of stonework with plaster missing is noteworthy. Behind a loose block is a large gold cup (worth 450 gp) which contains 112 gp and 3 onyx gems (each worth 50 gp). 108. GARBAGE ROOM The former use of this area cannot be determined, but it is now filled with trash, waste, bones, and the like. It is very odoriferous. Nothing of value is apparent, nor are any exits. If the party persists in disturbing the trash, they arouse the 20 giants rats, which attack hungrily. If more than ten of the rats are slain, the rest probably retreat (50% chance, check each round). Rats, giant (20): AC 7, MV 12 *//6", HD 112, hp 3 each, #AT 1, D 1-3; XP 10 each 109. FRESCOED CORRIDOR This passage is evidently one of impor­ tance, for it is plastered and painted with the evil scenes typical of the Temple. The east-west 10' wide passage leading to this area slopes gradually downward to it. This 20' wide corridor in turn gently descends towards Dungeon Level Two . These gradients are such that only dwarves or gnomes easily notice them (75% and 80% chance, respectively). Others do not do so unless the group is spread out over more than 40 feet, in which case a 10% chance exists per ten feet of spread length. 46 If the wide corridor is taken, refer to area 201. 109a. STAIRWAY The corridor ends in a stairway which diag­ onals upward, leading to a vestry in the upper temple (area 4 to the east, or area 5 to the west). 110. S10RAGE CHAMBER This chamber is obviously no longer in use, for it contains sacks of moldering grain, barrels of rotting flour, and heaps of broken containers and spilled contents in a jumbled mess. Nothing of any use or value remains here. 111. S10RAGE CHAMBER From the stale reek in this room, you can determine that much beer, wine, and ale was poured out here. The floor is cov­ ered with a dark residue, and broken tuns, barrels, casks, and kegs are strewn everywhere. Careful inspection reveals one small barrel with contents intact. It is vinegary wine, however, now so bad that anyone sampling it loses 1-4 points of strength for 2-12 turns, due to nausea. 112. ARMORY Refer to area 101 for a general description. Anything of value seems to have been smashed or removed. A usable mace remains, but is found only if a full turn is spent searching the place. 113. ARMORY Refer to area 101 for a general description. This place has been thoroughly vandalized. On a small ledge of one of the supporting arches, ten feet above the floor, lies a cross­ bow bolt + 3. A detect magic spell easily reveals its location, but without this dweomer, even a thorough search provides only a 5% chance of finding it. However, if any character manages to reach a height of more than nine feet above the chamber floor, its discovery is 75% likely. 0NGiIIAL ADVEIITVR!OS REiIICAR._IIATED • THE TEJtl:PLE 0F ELEJtl:EIITAL EVI L 114. SECURED DOOR The closures of this portal indicate that it is used with relative frequency. A door lock and padlock are present, the latter securing a chain . Unles the locks can be picked, only force can remove the obstacle. The door breaks only after 50 points of damage are applied. Attackers may make two hits per round; consider the door as Large size. The noise of such an attack draws all the occupants from area 115 in the next round. This dark, filthy chamber is the prison in which captives are held, for eventual sacrifice at the Earth Temple (area 145) or for feasting of ghouls and ghasts (areas 115-118). Eleven human prisoners are curently here; all are naked, and the males are chained to the wall. Al are from the Nulb area. The two females are the wife and servant of a merchant. The males are as follows: 2 merchants (XP 13 each) 3 servants (XP 12 each) 1 river sailor (Level 0, hp 6, XP 16) 4 men-at-arms (Level 0, hp 4 each, XP 14 each) The prisoners have nothing of value, and know nothing of the Temple. They tell of being captured by raiding ghouls, except for the sailor, who was brought here by Dick Rentsch and his men as punishment for making a pass at Dala. The merchants, wife, and servants can offer no ransom, and if freed ask only to be shown how to get out and away, quickly. The sailor and men-at­ arms will most certainly serve with loyalty, if supplied with clothing, armor and arms. If treated fairly and paid normally, they remain 100% loyal while in the employ of their liberators. 115. ROOM, 20' x 30' Six ghouls dwell in this area. They pass through the eastern door to investigate any noise coming from the corridor, as noted in area 114. If intruders are discovered, five attack while one hastens to alert those in area 116. Ghouls (6): AC 6, MV 9 ", HD 2, hp 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, #AT 3, D 1-3/1-3/1-6, SA touch paralyzes; XP 91, 89, 87, 85, 83, 81 The south wall of this chamber bears a bas relief of a hideous head-a human­ like face with squashed features, the face low upon a mushroom-shaped cranium. Various humanoids, monsters, and demoniac creatures prance and jape in the background. The remains of a sand­ stone altar lie in fragments before this sculpture. All furnishings are gone, but six heaps of old clothing, rags and what­ not remain, indicating that something yet dwells herein. A wooden box is near the north door. The west door has a peep hole, usable from inside the room. The box contains an old cloak of no value, 263 cp, and a 6 inch tall finely carved ivory statuette (worth 85 gp). These creatures, like their fellows in areas fre run of this sector of the Temple's upper dungeon to serve as a first line of defense. (It is also hoped that a sufficient force of ghouls and ghasts can be built to be later formed into a contingent of the Temple hordes when they re­ emerge to war upon the forces of Good.) 116. ROOM, 30' x 20' Six ghouls residing herein move to aid their fellows as needed. If necessary, one goes to room 117 to summon more aid, while the other five attack enemies. If intruders approach from the north, the one alerts those in area 115, of course, while the others aid their masters. Ghouls (6): AC 6, MV 9 ", HD 2, hp 14, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, #AT 3, D 1-3/1-3/1-6, SA touch paralyzes; XP 93, 85, 83, 81, 79, 79 The stench of ghouls lies heavily here, as well. Parts of rotting tapestries still adorn the east and west walls. A battered table and two stools ocupy the center of the room. Mounds of cloth line the walls, apparently beds for the occupants. A water barrel is near the south door, and a ful sack rests near the north door. The water barrel is placed over a hole in the floor, wherein 192 sp and 47 ep are kept. The sack contains the clothing taken from the current captives (in area 114) and three others as well, now deceased. However, no weapons are here. 47 117. ROOM, 20' x 20' Two ghasts live in this room. They tend to flee from a lost cause or join a winning fight, as they perceive the situation. When fleeing, they head for area 107 (via areas 103-106). Ghasts (2): AC 4, MV 15", HD 4, hp 19, 16, #AT 3, D 1-4/1-4/1-8, SA touch paralyzes, stench 10' radius - save vs. poison or suf­ fer -2 "to hit" penalty; XP 26, 254 A ten-foot alcove is in the northeast cor­ ner of the room. Its walls were once plas­ tered and painted, but where the covering still remains, some sort of mold or similar growth has discolored it suffi­ ciently to make the colors and subject matter undistinguishable. Bones are heaped in a pile in the alcove, and a dis­ gusting odor lingers about the place. Tom cloth and old cushions are piled to form two tangled nests of bedding near the south door. A large iron-bound chest with a heavy padlock stands in the southeast comer. The chest is not trapped, but is padlocked (as described). It contains 611 sp, a brooch with a carnelian stone with a cameo coat of arms (Veluna, quartered by the Knights of the Hart) worth 80 gp, and a scroll of protection from undead in a silver tube worth 35 gp. 118. HALL, 10' x 30' The two ghasts dwelling herein are the lead­ ers of this complex and the one to the south­ east (areas 113-117). They are large and lazy, and bully the weaker ghasts and ghouls, getting the best of the food and loot. The larger of this pair gains a + 1 bonus to all "to hit" and damage rolls; it wears a gold chain. Neither ghast retreats as do the oth­ ers. Unless forced away by a cleric or magic, both stay and fight to the death; they love their life of ease and know that it is lost if they show weakness. Ghasts (2): AC 4, MV 15", HD 4, hp 29, 24, #AT 3, D 1-4/1-4/1-8, SA touch paralyzes, stench 10' radius = save vs. poison or suf­ fer -2 "to hit" penalty; XP 306, 286 This area is plastered and wainscoated in some (now ruined) wood. It was evi­ dently some form of trophy or museum 0zjGiIIAL ADVEII'f'V'S REiIICA1'_IIA1'ED • THE TEJltPLE 0F ELEJltEIITAL EVIL room, and several broken cases are shoved against the walls. A serviceable but moldy shield hangs on the west wall. Two great heaps of old cloth and pillows and like materials are formed to serve as beds. The larger ghast wears a gold chain worth 7,000 gp, set with three small rubies worth 1,00 gp each. The smaller has a ruby ring (worth 4,00 gp) so encrusted with dirt and filth that it goes unnoticed unless the mon­ ster's left hand is carefully and specifically examined. The shield on the west wall is a shield + 1, long forgotten by the remaining Temple authorities. The only other treasure is worn by the room's inhabitants. 119. BANQUET HALL This huge place is over 100' long and 30 ' wide in the main portion. The litter of tables, trestles, benches, chairs, and stools scattered and heaped about the place show that great revelries of Evil were one conducted here. Bits of tapes­ tries and drapes still hang here and there from the walls. Bones and whole skele­ tons can be seen on the floor and under the heaped broken furniture. A skirmish in the greater battle for the Temple was surely fought in this place! A careful search reveals one usable shield and weapon each turn, to a maximum of four of each. Roll ld4 to determine what weapon is discovered: 1 = longsword, 2 = shortsword, 3 - battle axe, 4 - spear. Nothing else here is of value, unless kindling wood is desired . . . . 120. KITCHEN This place is 20 'x 30 ' ,  with three doors in the southern portion - east, south in the west corner, and west, A high, broad fireplace with numerous side ovens dom­ inates the north wall. The fireplace is large enough to roast a whole ox. The room is littered with broken containers and dishes, trash of an unidentifiable sort, and pieces of wooden tables, counter tops, and the like. Several skele­ tons are visible, including one which appears to be that of an ogre. Within the darkest recesses of the unused fireplace dwells a giant poisonous snake. It is coiled and may strike by surprise (50% chance). It has not eaten for a long time, and is very hungry. It can strike to 8 foot range, half its length, and attacks any creature corning within that range. Snake: AC 5, MV 15", HD 4 + 2, hp 21, #AT 1, D 1-3 + poison, SA bite = save vs. poi­ son; take 3d6 damage if made, die if failed; attack range = 8' 112 length); XP 495 Near the ogre skeleton is a usable shortsword (its "dagger") and a leather sack containing 84 gp. These are hidden under a small pile of nondescript debris. The ten-foot-square rooms were used for crockery storage and food storage, respec­ tively for the south and west areas. Their contents are broken and smashed; food­ stuffs are spoiled. 121. ROOM, 20' x 20' Four gnolls remain here as sentries. One is posted at the spy hole at all times, while the other three take their ease. If any intruder is sen, two join the watcher at the door to ambush anyone entering, while one alerts those in area 122. If all party members are wearing the brown robes of the Earth Temple, the gnolls do not attack. They behave simi­ larly towards those wearing other robes, if they appear strong and do not attack first. The gnolls are smart enough to use water or dirt against fire. Each gnoll has 2-12 ep. Gnolls (4): AC 5, MV 9", HD 2, hp 10, 7, 7, 6, #AT 1, D 2-8 (bastard sword), SA throwing axes (D 1-6/1-4, ranges 1 "/2 "I 3 "); XP 48, 42, 42, 40 The bare stone walls of this place have only a peg or two here and there, and three brackets with unlit torches in them. The floor likewise is plain stone blocks. A rude wooden table is against the east wall, just south of the eastern door, with three stools nearby. A small keg full of water stands in the northwest comer, and next to it is a mound of ordinary looking dirt. The south door has a spy hole, openable only from inside the room. 122. CHAMBER, 20' x 20' Four gnolls are on guard duty here. One watches each door, one checks the passage- 48 way, and the last watches the others, taking a position in the northwest corner. A thin rope hangs down in that corner, connected to a weighted rope net. If any enemies enter, the gnolls give way to the northwest corner and grab spears, appearing to be grouping for a stand; then the rope is jerked, and the net falls. The gnolls hurl their spears at entrapped opponents, grab oil from the shelf and add them to the fray, and then uncover a small fire box with smouldering punk. This bursts aflame when . the box is opened, and the gnoll hurls it into the oil to ignite it. Though these gnolls have no orders to alert others, those in areas 121 and 123 probably (90% chance, checked for each) respond to the sounds of battle. Gnolls (4): AC 5, MV 9 ", HD 2, hp 13, 11, 9, 7, #AT 1, D 2-8 (morning star), SA thrown spears (D 1-6/1-8, ranges 1 "/2 "I 3 "), net trap; XP 54, 50, 46, 42 The walls of this place are of plain stone. Doors to the north and west are normal. Four heaps of bedding - rags, torn tap­ estries, rugs, etc. - lie by the south wall. Two stools stand near the entrance to the southeast passage. Opposite this entrance, along the wall, is a crude shelf, supporting several samples of pottery - bottles and mugs. Under it, in the north­ west corner, stand four spears. If the gnolls herein have not already used them as weapons, five flasks of oil are on the shelf, by two mugs. Four bottles are empty, and one contains wine. The largest gnoll wears a silver chain with a roughly polished carnelian (worth 125 gp). Each gnoll carries 1-4 sp, 1-4 ep, and 1-4 gp. 123. ROOM WITH ALCOVE Five gnolls dwell here with two renegade hobgoblins. The latter are meaner and more bloodthirsty than the gnollsl The gnolls are "off duty" members of a reforming com­ pany which the Earth Temple hopes to field. (See also 124 and 126-128.) If they hear sounds of fighting, 1-4 of these inhabitants probably (90% chance) go to investigate and join in the fun. The secret door, a pivot­ ing wall section which is also concealed - hidden by a tattered carpet - is only used in dire emergencies; the ogres of area 124 are greatly feared. 0Rj cinAL ADVEil'f'V'S REi ilCAR_IlA'f'ED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEilTAL EVIL Gnolls (S): AC S, MV 9 w, HD 2, hp 11, 9, 9, 8, 7, #AT 1, D 2-8 (morning star), SA throwing axes (D 1-6, ranges 1 H12 • /3 "); XP SO, 46, 46, 44, 42 Hobgoblins (2): AC S, MV 9 w, HD 1 + 1, hp 8, 6, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword), SA long composite bows with lS arrows each (D 1-6); XP 36, 32 Carpets and tapestries cover the plain stone walls of this room, and a few rugs are on the floor as well. From the appearance of all this, the room was once the quarters of some fairly important person - an underpriest of the Earth Temple, from the scenes depicted on several tapestries. Whatever furniture was once here is now gone. Heaps of cloth lie near the walls, showing where the inhabitants sleep. A small brazier stands in the northeast cor­ ner. A small keg of cheap beer is in the cen­ ter of the room. The only exit is the door in the south wall of the alcove. Each of the seven humanoids herein has 1-4 sp, 1-4 ep, and 1-4 gp. Under the dead coals of the brazier are 27 pp. 124. ROOM, 20' x 20' The two ogres here are in charge of the gnolls and hobgoblins to the southwest. Each wears a brown leather jack, set with thin bronze plates (giving AC 4). Unless they are summoned, they ignore sounds from areas 121-123, concentrating their attention on possible victims in area 125. However, their chief is in area 126, and they investigate unusual noises from that place. Ogres (2): AC 4, MV 9 w, HD 4 + 1, hp 22, 20, #AT 1 ,  D S-10 (stone-set club, ld6 + 4); XP 20, 190 This place is plastered and the floor paved with polished brown granite slabs. It is now dirty and cluttered, but must once have been a plush guest chamber. Many cushions and pillows are piled so as to make beds in the northeast and northwest comers of the room. A half-empty wine barrel and a like container with a few salted fish stand along the south wall. Another barrel there holds seven long spears. Pegs on the wall hold one shortbow and three quivers, each containing 20 arrows. Beside the barrels is a chest. Each ogre has a belt pouch containing 5-30 sp and 5-30 gp. The wine barrel contains sour, thin wine. The chest is unlocked, and holds 2 maces, S hand axes, 1 battle axe, 6 morning stars, 2 shortswords, and 1 broadsword. The stone slab under the spear barrel is loose and can be lifted by anyone with 18 Strength, or two persons with a combined Strength of 30. Underneath is a cavity with 870 sp and a silver bracelet (170 gp) adorned with six azurites worth 10 gp each. 125. CORRIDOR OF BONES For at least 100 feet of its length, this 20 ' wide corridor is covered with bones. Skeletons of humans and humanoids are mixed in a terrible jumble. Many skulls and loose bones seem gnawed. The com­ plete skeletons, though, still wear sun­ dered armor, dented caps, or sprawl by broken shields. Bent and broken weap­ ons likewise testify to a great melee hav­ ing taken place here; a hundred, two, perhaps more . . .  all met death here. Fur­ ther progress along the corridor requires carefully picking a path between these grim remains of the Temple hordes. Nothing of value is discemable. If the party enters the corridor area shaded on the map, they spring a trap. When they get to the central area (just south of the secret door to area 131), the following events occur: a. Ten human skeletons spring up from the west end of the shaded area, charging east to the attack; b. Six gnoll skeletons spring up at the east end of the shaded area, moving west to surround the intruders. In addition, the two ogres (area 124) watch­ ing for trouble join the fray if the intruders (PCs) are nearly slain, or if the party retreats into the southern 20' wide corridor leading to their door. If the latter, the ogres probably (7S % )  gain 1-4 surprise segments unless their door is being carefully watched. Skeletons, human (10): AC 7, MV 12 ", HD 1, hp 8, 6, S, S, S, S, 4, 4, 4, 3; #AT 1, D 1-6; XP 22, 20, 19 (x4), 18 (x3), 17 Skeletons, gnoll (6): AC 7, MV 9 w, HD 2, hp 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7; #AT 1, D 2-7; XP S2, 49 SO, 48, 46, 44, 42 Ten man-turns of searching the corridor reveals the following intact items: lS arrows, 4 silver arrows, S morning stars, 3 longswords, 2 shortswords, 3 shields, 1 ring mail, 2 chain mail, and 1 plate mail. 126. ROOM, 20' x 20' Herein dwells an ogre, the chief of the entire ogre force. He reports to the clerics in area 137 from time to time. If he hears a commo­ tion in the corridor or nearby rooms, he probably (90 % ) ignores it, trusting his flun­ kies to handle the minor matters. He responds to any direct call for help at his door, of course. Ogre leader: AC 3, MV 9 ", HD 4 + 1, hp 26, #AT 1, D S-12 (ld8 + 4, with battle axe); XP 220 This place appears to have been another visitors' chamber, but the plastered walls are broken and smoke-stained from the struggles of the past. Several couches have been shoved together to form a huge bed in the northeast comer. Several empty sacks lie on the floor, and a nearly full barrel of ale is near the west door. A large table and rude chair are in the northwest corner; a big, yellowish cheese and several hard sausages lie atop the table, beside an empty gallon jug. Under the table is an iron chest. Nine spears, 3 morning stars, and 2 long­ swords lie piled by the south door. The ogre wears a copper belt worth 3S gp, upon which hangs his purse, containing 11 sp, 19 ep, and 38 gp. The iron chest is locked but not trapped, and contains 311 gp and 2 huge and remark­ ably perfect agates (worth 100 gp and SOO gp, respectively). The lock can be picked or broken open by 30 points of damage. 127. L-SHAPED ROOM Three gnolls are quartered here. They are reasonably alert, and if called rush to help, hurrying more to serve the ogre (area 126), of course, than for their fellows with the bugbear (area 128). If opportunity presents, the one gnoll armed with a bow uses it until opponents close. Each gnoll has 1-4 sp, 1-4 ep, and 1-4 gp. 0NGi ilAL ADVEil'fVRJ;S REiilCARJIA'fED • THE TEJl:PLE 0F ELEJl:EllTAL EVIL Gnolls (3): AC 5, MV 9", HD 2, hp 13, 12, 8, #AT 1, D 2-8 (bastard sword), SA 1 has long composite bow and 20 arrows (D 1-6); XP 54, 52, 44 The fireplace on the west wall of this room shows that special folk were housed here. Three battered old chairs are still in place, by a broken bed of large size. A wooden box stands near the bed, with a small keg nearby. Several old cloaks hang from wall hooks. 128. ROOM, 20' x 30' Seven gnolls are in the room, one by each door and one deep in the alcove with a heavy quadruple crossbow (see area 128a). They live here with a bugbear who is a rogue, liking the gnolls and ogres better than its own kind. In case of attack, these residents alert those in area 127 (or even the guards in area 129, as applicable). The alcove is five feet wide and six feet long, and houses the once gnoll sentry maning the special crossbow. A pep hole gives a good view of the corridor south (se area 128a). · Gnolls (7): AC 5, MV 9 ", HD 2, hp 13, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 6, #AT 1, D 1-8 (battle axe), SA crossbow trap (se area 128a); XP 54, 48, 46 (x2), 44 (x3), 40 Bugbear (1): AC 5, MV 9", HD 3 + 1, hp 14, #AT 1, D 2-8 (bastard sword), SA can throw battle (ranges l "/2 • /4 •, D 3-10), XP 191 Perhaps this was once a reception room or minor council chamber. Bits of wall coverings still dangle here and there, and a once fine hardwood sideboard is cen­ tered along the north wall. Atop it are various dirty dishes, a cask of beer, and bits of stale bread and dried meat. The entire length of the west wall is lined with piles of bedding, divided into eight pal­ lets. A small wall font still trickles a sul­ phurous smelling water into a stone basin in the northwest comer. A stack of wood lies by the south door, possibly for use in some nearby fireplace. A five­ foot- wide alcove can be seen in the east wall, near the northeast comer. Each gnoll has 3-18 cp. The bugbear carries a pouch containing 1-4 of each coin type (cp, sp, ep, gp, pp), and also wears a gold chain with 12 large coins upon it (130 gp for the whole). A hollow log at the bottom of the stack of wood conceals the bugbear's private stash of 60 sp, 28 ep, and 47 gp. 128a. SENTRY The large and heavy quadruple crossbow mounted here is manned by one gnoll (hp 6), who can easily watch the 10' wide north-south corridor through a peep hole. Any intruder in the passage is subject to four shots at once, each inflicting 1-8 points of damage. Make "to hit" rolls with a + 5 bonus, i.e. 9 or better to hit AC 2 when fired by the gnoll sentry. As the crossbow cannot be reloaded and wound in less than two full rounds, it is unlikely that it can fire twice in a melee. (Use your judgment as to the sen­ try's actions, which should definitely include warning its companions.) The crossbow is not easily moved (encum­ brance 400 gp) but can be dismantled for tra­ vel. It can be sold for a base value of SO gp. 129. GUARDROOM Five guards are alert here at al times. One fac­ ing the door, and another posted ten feet up the northeast corridor (position G on the map), are armed with heavy crossbows and longswords. Each of the others has a javelin, to be hurled before closing to melee. Each guard wears chain mail armor with a brown surcoat; each carries a shield covered in brown leather and bearing a black triangular boss. This triangle device is also sewn to their sur­ coats. In any disturbance, the guards alert area 130 (or 128, as appropriate). Each guard carries 2-8 cp, 2-8 sp, and 2-8 ep. Guards (5): AC 4, MV 9", Level 0, hp 7, 6, 5, 5, 5, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword) or 2-5 (crossbow bolt); SA javelins (D 1-6, ranges 2 •I 4 "/6 "); XP 21, 20, 19 (x3) This 20 ' square room was obviously a guard room. Racks for weapons still remain on the eastern wall. A table with 4 chairs takes up the northwest comer. A water barrel, nearly full, stands beside the west door, with a bundle of ten torches beside it. A single torch bums on the south wall. Two candles light the table. Some rectangular bone markers are on the table, by a jug and several so ceramic mugs. Several pegs and hooks on the south wall hold old brown cloaks, a leather bag, and a shortbow with a quiver of five arrows. The bone markers are dominoes, worth 5 gp for the set. The jug holds watered wine, and the leather bag is filled with hard biscuits and dried apples. 130. ROOM WITH TRAPEZOIDAL ANNEX Seven zero-level guards are barracked in the 20' square area, ready to fight whenever necessary. These men-at-arms are the core of the new company of Elemental Earth Reavers. Each carries a javelin, to be hurled before closing for melee. They, along with their fellows in area 129, always do their best to protect area 133 - but if it becomes obvious that they are losing a fight, they might flee (25% chance, check each round): Four fighters are quartered in the trapezoi­ dal area; they are the leaders of the company. Each is clad in bronzed plate mail and caries the brown shield with black triangular bos. They take orders from the cleric in area 137. Each fighter carries two javelins for use before melee, and their leader (Level 4) car­ ries a javelin of lightning for use in an emer­ gency. (The ogres, for example, know of this and obey accordingly.) Each has average Strength except for the L3 leader, who has a 17 ( + 1 to hit/ + 1 damage). Guards (7): AC 4, MV 9", Level 0, hp 7, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3; #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword), SA 1 javelin each (D 1-6, ranges 2 "/4"/ 6 "); XP 21, 19 (x2), 18 (x3), 17 Fighters (4): AC 2, MV 6", Levels 4, 3, 2, 2, hp 30, 19, 13, 12, #AT 1, D 1-8 (long­ sword), SA 2 javelins each (D 1-6, ranges 2 "/4 "/6 "); L4 Fighter has javelin of light­ . ning + 2  (ranges 3"/6 "/9 ", D 1-6 + 20 electricity in 5'x 30 ' bolt); L3 Fighter gains + 1 "to hit" and damage; XP 205, 107, 54, 52 The former purpose of this room cannot be ascertained, but the four bunks in the south end obviously show that it now houses troops of some sort. Pegs on the wall are many, and one holds a brown cape. A bench is near the door to the west. Two torches give light to the area. 0RjGiilAL A.DVEil'fV'S REi ilCAR_IlATED • THE TEJltPLE 0F ELEJltEilTA.L EVIL A trapezoidal area through the arch­ way to the north contains four narrow cots, four small wooden chests, and a small wall fountain which dribbles smelly water into its basin. A long table with two benches and a chair at head and foot complete the furnishings. Light comes from a lantern, held aloft above the table by a thin chain; two unlit torches are mounted on the walls. An open cupboard by the table holds vari­ ous dishes and four jugs. Each guard has 2-8 cp, 2-8 sp, and 2-8 ep. Each fighter wears a bronze ring with a tri­ angular setting of jet (worth 50 gp). These rings are passes to any area of this dungeon level not commanded by a cleric (though undead tend to ignore such niceties ... ). Each fighter carries various coins (ep, gp, and pp), the number of each determined by roll­ ing 2d6 per level of experience (the L4 leader thus carrying 8-48 of each coin type). The water in the fountain is smelly but drinkable. The jugs in the cupboard hold water, wine, beer, and fuel oil (three pints worth 1 gp each), respectively. Each chest contains nondescript items of clothing and one leather ceremonial harness with a large, bronze-hilted dagger (worth 15 gp with the harness). One chest also contains a scrap of parchment, inscribed with a message, in Common: "Remember to check AUGURY CHAMBER to se if Belstro was lying!" 131. SECRET DOOR The shaft which descends from the Temple to Dungeon Level Two has a means of entrance and egres at this point. The portal is but two fet wide and four feet high, opening by downward presure (which causes it to sink); it closes automatically one round later. The area beyond has a narrow ledge, which con­ tinues to spiral towards the level below. 132. HEXAGONAL ROOM A partially destroyed stone chair domi­ nates this place. It is hewn of brown mar­ ble, veined with black, and stands near the middle of the north wall. Both arms have been broken off, and the seat is chipped. A piece is missing from the back, and the whole is fractured. Rubble and broken furniture are strewn about the room. The ceiling overhead is at least 35 ' high-possibly more, lost in the shadows of the supporting arches. The stench of rotting flesh faintly lingers throughout the area. Eighteen stirges lurk in the ceiling vault, nesting in the nooks and crannies of the sup­ porting arches and buttresses and 90% undetectable until their attack. They thus have a 50% chance of surprise unless some­ one does notice them, or unless an overhead lookout is maintained. In any event, intruders are attacked within three rounds of entering the room. When half the stirges are slain, the remainder retire to their ceiling nests, where ten young remain (which are one week from maturity). Stirges (18): AC 8, MV 3n/l8 ", HD l + l, hp 6, 5, or 4 {equal numbers of each), #AT 1, D 1-3, SA attack as if 4 HD, blood drain after hit (D 1-4 per round); XP 48 (x6), 46 (x6), 44 {x6) Close examination of the area reveals bones and 1-4 cp per searcher each round {to a maximum of 40 cp in all). If the floor is care­ fully searched, a ring of shooting stars may be found; allow a 5% chance of success per searcher per round {or 100% if a detect magic spell is employed) .  This item belonged to one of the victims of the stirges, which availed not in this place. The secret door is counterbalanced to swing inward at the bottom when a wall stone is pulled to the right. 133. ANTEROOM Four guards are stationed here at all times. One has a short bow, his shield being set nearby ready for use if melee occurs. Each of the others has a javelin ready to hurl before closing with opponents. Each wears chain mail armor, a brown surcoat with a black triangle sewn upon it, and a shield covered in brown leather, whose boss is also a triangular metal device. If attacked, the guards defend their position while alerting those in area 134 by yanking on a wire alarm (see descriptional). Guards (4): AC 4, MV 9", Level 0, hp 5, 5, 4, 4, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword), SA 3 with javelin (D 1-6, ranges 2 "/4 */6 "), 1 with shortbow (#AT 2, D l-6); XP 19, 19, 18, 18 SI This 10 'x 20' hall is lit by two torches, and contains a bench, and a stool. The walls are plastered. Several pegs and hooks have ben recently added, from the look of them, and support a brown cloak, a quiver with 9 arrows, and a hand axe. Several eye bolts are mounted horizontally along the west wall; a wire runs through them and into the north wall. Each guard carries 1-8 sp and 1-6 gp. 134. INNER CHAMBER The south door opens inward and to the west. Eight guards are quartered here to protect the areas northward. Though at rest, they can be ready to fight in a single round. Four of the guards are armed with light crossbows. For combat, two of these go to the west comers of the room to cover the door, using bunks as partial cover. (The one in the northwest comer is a half-ore.) The other pair retires behind a stout mantlet {blocking the entrance into area 135, as shown on the map), kneeling with cross­ bows at ready. The mantlet has two crosslets at waist height for this tactic, and can also provide chest-high protection for two others if spears or pole arms are used. While the crossbowmen take their posi­ tions, 2 swordsmen move to the door to open it, while the remaining two swords­ men step behind the mantlet and take up glaives {which are kept along the west wal1 just inside of area 135), preparing to defend. Note that combat brings other guards from area 135, but only after five rounds pass, as they must first don armor and take up arms. Guards (8): AC 4, MV 9", Level 0, hp 7, 6, 6, 5 (swordsmen), 5, 4, 4, 3, {crossbow­ men), #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword) or 1-6 (glaive, 9' length), SA 4 have light cross­ bows (D 2-5); XP 17, 16, 16, 15 (swords­ men), 19, 18, 18, 17 (crossbowmen) If more than half of the guards are killed, the half-ore crossbowman in the northwest cor­ ner (a creature of surly mien) tries to surren­ der, for he hates his commander (who tortures and kills ores for sport). This 20' square plastered room is lit by two torches and a lantern, the latter fixed to shine upon the south door. The room has been converted into a barracks, as 0ajGiIIAL ADVEII'fV'S REiIICAR_IIA'fED • THE TEJltPLE 0F ELEJltEllTAL EVIL can be sen from the four double bunks to each side. A mantlet stands between this room and that to the north, giving solid protection to the defenders. Several brown cloaks hang from pegs driven through the plaster into wall cracks. A jug and several cups are on the table. Eight small chests are shoved under the bunks. The half-ore has 1-4 cp and 1-4 sp. Each of the other guards has 1-6 ep and 1-6 gp. The jug is half filled with watered wine. Each chest holds only worthless clothing, har­ ness, etc. 135. LOUNGE Eight guards are off-duty here. Action in area 134 or 136 alerts them, but they do not participate until they have donned their armor and taken up their arms (requiring five full rounds). Each has two javelins to hurl before closing to melee; each is dressed as those in 134 and elsewhere. In desperate straits, the guards use flam­ ing oil missiles, taking empty bottles from a cabinet on the east wall, filling them with fuel oil from a cask by the north door, and stoppering them with rags. If truly imper­ iled, they roll the whole cask of oil to a point near intruders, smash the end closest to their foes (creating an oil spill), and ignite it. Combat in this area alerts the fighters in area 136, but these reinforcements will ignore more distant noises (such as skir­ mishing in area 134). Guards (8): AC 4, MV 9 #, Level 0, hp 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword), SA 2 javelins each (D 1-6, ranges 2 NI 4 NI 6 #); XP 20, 19 (x4), 18 (x3) Four walls cressets send smoky light through this room. The place is plas­ tered, the floor covered with mosaic tiles. The paintings on the walls display scenes indicating that this room was meant for drinking and debauching (though whether for the clerics of the Temple or its guests remains uncertain). Eight double bunks are here. A long and well-made table in the middle of the room is flanked by long benches, plus a chair at each end. Cloaks on pegs are apparent, as are chests under the bunks. Three barrels stand just inside the south door, two containing liquids and the other some lumpy objects. Several large smoked sausages hang from a rope tossed over a ceiling truss. A small cabi­ net between the bunks on the east wall holds dishes. If not used in defense, a cask containing seven gallons of fuel oil also stands near the north door, and three empty bottles accom­ pany the dishes in the cabinet. Fuel oil can be sold for 1 ep per pint (16 gp per gallon). Of the barrels by the south door, one holds 50 gallons of water, the center one about 25 gallons of beer (worth 15 gp), and the third, hard biscuits. The chests under the bunks, similar to those in area 134, hold nothing of value save a dozen torches and a pair of normal lanterns. Each guard carries 1-4 cp, 1-4 sp, 1-4 ep, and 1-4 gp. 136. INNER CHAMBER The fifth level commander of this group and his third level lieutenant dwell here. They directly serve the priest of the Earth Temple. They hope to soon recruit sufficient forces to completely control this dungeon level, and plan to extend their sway lower. Any previous losses of troops, human or human­ oid, wil have resulted in threats of dire con­ sequences from their priest, with the result that they will fight fearlessly. If they move to investigate battle sounds, these leaders do not bother the clerics to the north (area 137) unless the danger is obvi­ ously extreme. Commander: AC 2, MV 6 #, Level 5 Fighter, hp 36, #AT l, D 2-9 (battle axe + 1); XP 310 Lieutenant: AC 2, MV 6 #, Level 3 Fighter, hp 29, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword), SA Strength 17 ( + 1 "to hit", + 1 damage); XP 122 Two cressets illuminate this room. The area was once lavishly decorated. Two plush couches, a wardrobe, a small table with inlaid wood top, and two padded armchairs still remain. A large chest stands near the couch, by the eastern wall. On the table are a few dented pew­ ter dishes and some food. An unlit can­ dle in a wooden candlestick stands atop the wardrobe. 52 Each fighter wears a bronze ring, set with a triangular stone of jet (worth 50 gp). The commander wears a gold chain (worth 200 gp) under his armor, and carries 10--60 gp and 10-60 pp. The lieutenant carries 6-36 gp and 6-36 pp. The food on the table consists of a partial loaf of stale bread, a sausage, some fruit, and a small piece of cheese. The wardrobe contains clothing only, none of it worth any notable value. The Jock on the chest is secured, and takes 35 points of damage to demolish. The chest holds clothing of no value, a quart of excellent brandy, a coil of normal rope (50 ' ), and a potion of healing. 137. SLEEPING APARTMENT In the north of this pair of rooms lives Romag, a curate (L4) and priest of the Earth Elemental Temple. He is determined to become the leading cleric of the Temple of Elemental Evil, and is gathering forces to accomplish this. He would particularly enjoy raiding and looting the Water Elemen­ tal Temple, and killing its priest. In the southern room of the pair, through a four-foot-wide concealed archway (cov­ ered by a tapestry), lives Hartch, an adept. He is ready to serve his master (Romag) and eager to pass on his commands. If alerted by their guards to the south or by noise in that direction, Hartsch observes through a peep hole in the door, and throws the large bar on the south door for defense. That portal may thereafter be destroyed only by 200 points of damage. If the fighting in this area gets too hot (assuming that it approaches from the south), Romag uses his darknes spell, slips into the concealed alcove to the northwest, gets his treasure from a large iron chest therein (se description below), and runs away. If he does so, he will be too ashamed to ever return - and his defeat would assure his death at the hands of other clerics anyway. If danger approaches from the north, Romag may (40% chance) hide in the alcove to the northeast after alerting Hartsch to summon the guards. He otherwise joins Hartsch in getting assistance, and com­ mands the battle from the rear. Note that the fighters and guards in areas 134-136 use an appropriate strategy, roughly the same as that described in the area descriptions but reversed in direction. Note also that the guards in area 133 maintain their post, not moving to aid the fight to the north. 0RjGiIIAL ADVEIITVRJ:S REiIICAR_IIATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EIITAL EVIL Romag: AC 0, MV 12 ", Level 4 Cleric, hp 24, #AT 1, D 2-7 (mace + 1), SA spells, XP 321 First level: command, cure light wounds, curse (to miss crucial attacks}, darkness Second level: hold person, resist fire, silence 15 ' radius Hartsch: AC 2, MV 9H, Level 2 Cleric, hp 13, #AT 1, D 1-6 (mace).

Hartsch wears a gold ring (worth 25 gp} and a gold brooch set with a triangular piece of jet (worth 150 gp}, and carries a purse containing 11 gp and 17 pp. The southern face of the door to this place is sheathed in bronze, and bears a peep hole. The bar on the inside is very thick. The door opens northward, swinging west. The walls herein are hung with tapestries and rugs, and the floor is covered with several layers of carpets. A pair of bronze lamps light the place, sus­ pended on chains from the ceiling. A brass brazier on a tripod makes the room both too warm and too stuffy from the smoke of incense. A divan, small table, two chairs, and a cupboard stand along the east wall. A large armoire with side drawers stands by the west wall. The table holds a silver flask, several ceramic dishes and cups, and some foodstuffs - fruit, shelled nuts, and sweetmeats. The 15 carpets and rugs strewn about the place have little value - about 3-18 sp each. The silver flask on the table is worth 40 gp, and holds good brandy. The wardrobe con­ tains several worthless garments, a pair of sandals and pair of boots, and a normal mace. The side drawers hold linens, towels, and the like. The lowest drawer on the left side holds incense and unguents worth 90 gp, with one-half cubic foot of volume and 30 gp encumbrance. One tapestry on the north wall conceals an archway, leading to Romag's room: Behind the large tapestry on the north wall is a four-foot-wide archway leading to a 10 'x 20 ' alcove. Two hanging lamps illuminate the area. A pillow-strewn bed is here, as well as a small desk and pad­ ded chair, a brass stand with several staves in it, a low table, two stools, and a wardrobe. A fountain in the southeast corner trickles a stream of clean water into a wall basin. The walls and floors are draped and carpeted. The desk contains a bottle of normal ink (worth 1 ep), 6 quills (each worth 1 ep}, and 10 sheets of parchment (worth 4 gp each}, but nothing of great value. The hanging lamps are worth 15 gp each. On the low table is a small tome (worth 50 gp to any evil spell user) detailing the sacrifice of humans to earth elementals. The wardrobe contains old clothing, a bag holding nine candles, and two bottles of very fine white wine (worth 2 gp each). The brass stand (worth 10 gp) holds two walking staves, one quar­ terstaff, and a bronzewood rod (which Romag uses as a swagger stick) worth 5 gp . The tapestries on the northern wall cover two narrow archways. The easternmost leads to a closet-like space where pegs hold Romag's ceremonial garb, including a brown velvet cassock upon which are embroidered triangles of gold thread with precious stones (8 jaspers and 28 hematites, with base values of 50 and 10 gp, respec­ tively) in the pattern illustrated. .. The western space contains an iron chest, the key lock of which is trapped with a poi­ son needle. The chest is chained to a ring set in the east wall. Inside are a bullseye lantern and tinderbox, two leather bags (containing 183 ep and 240 gp, respectively), a gold box set with ivory (worth 350 gp), a potion of speed, and a scroll of two cleric spells (ani­ mate dead and prayer). 53 138. LIBRARY This large chamber was once an exten­ sive library, as evidenced by the charred remains of books and litter of broken tables and chairs. Scraps of tom and burned scrolls are tossed here and there. A careful search reveals several remnants of works on the ethos of Chaotic Evil - double-dealing, self-advancement, treach­ ery, etc. The tenth such bit examined reveals the "sacred" earth triangle and mentions the "trial of earthy terrors awaiting the fool­ hardy"; this trial awaits ''below I elsewhere:· Nothing else of note is in the place. 139. STOREROOM This area was evidently one where strange and potent stuffs were once kept. The place is a welter of smashed flasks, broken pottery vessels, glass shards, all amidst the scattered remains of the con­ tents of these containers - herbs, spices, chemicals, and other strange mixtures and substances now unidentifiable. Even the shelves and benches which held these things are now broken and strewn about. The wreckage is total. The last statement is true only to the casual observer. A careful search reveals one item of the following list after a full tum of sifting through the mass. One is located each round thereafter, but each may be "found" by stepping on and ruining it. (Have a player roll ld6 for each; 1-3 indicates ruin.) Items are singular, not duplicated; use ld8 for random determination of each, but re­ roll duplicates. 1. A bottle of dull red powder (phosphorus, worth 35 gp) 2. A stoppered vial of sparkling red powder (ground ruby, worth 1,00 gp) 3. A bag containing 1-4 amber rods (worth 25 gp each} 4.

MEDITATION ROOM This chamber is plastered and painted with disgusting scenes and adages. It was apparently used as a restful (7) place to which the clerics of the cult might retreat and ponder the glories of Earthy Elemen­ tal Evil. A huge eye is painted on the ceil­ ing, and seems to glare down upon all in the place. Padded benches still line the walls, and several chairs remain intact. From the condition of these seats and the look of the floor, this ghastly chamber is still frequented on occassion. Nothing of value is here. 141. BRONZE DOOR This portal is shut fast by a massive lock. Upon its surface are runes (se illustra­ tion). Possibly they identify what is beyond, or perhaps they are some sort of warning. These runes form a glyph of warding, which inflicts 20 points of cold damage to anyone touching it (save vs. spells for half damage). The door is solid, and takes 300 points of damage before breaking open. However, any non-magical weapon used in such an attack may (1 in 6 chance, check per hit) break upon striking it. Inside the door is a rough-hewn crypt, with a passage leading north to a secondary burial place. Each of the 11 crypts contains the body of a cleric who met death in the service of the Earth Temple. Each body still wears the bronze ring with triangular setting of jet (worth 50 gp each). One body (ran­ domly determined) still wears a cloak of protection + 1 .  However, for each crypt opened, a 1 in 6 chance exists for all within 5 feet to contract respiratory disease (no Sav­ ing Throw), and this is automatic for the crypt containing the magical cloak. The vaults are relatively easy to open. 142. BLACK CHAMBER Note: Decrease chances of wandering mon­ sters in this area, and in the corridor leading south to it, to 1 in 20 (per turn). All of the stonework here is black, the surfaces being polished to a smooth, glossy texture. The domed ceiling 30 feet overhead shows phosphorescent gleams, each small dot obviously representing a star and the combinations making minia­ ture constellations. A broken obsidian altar stone stands in the center of the chamber; the place is otherwise empty. An arched exit, about 7 feet wide and 12 feet tall, breaks the smooth curve to the south. Upon the upper archway are carved letters in Common: EXHAULTED CHAMBER OF HIGH AUGURY 143. AUGURY CHAMBER Note: Decrease chances of wandering mon­ sters in this area to 1 in 20 (per turn). This 30' diameter chamber is finished in polished black stone, similar to the room immediately to the north. The phosphores­ cent gleamings 40 fet or so above have a bluish cast. In the center of the floor is a cir­ cular depression about one foot deep and ten feet in diameter. Around it is a low stone seat, so low that only halflings could comfortably sit upon it - or humans if they sat facing inward. Seated as described, visitors notice small cuts in the lower part of the seat. These are small drawers, spaced at intervals under the bench. There are eight in all, and seven are 54 empty; the last one examined contains strange bits of bone, ivory, rock, and wood: rods, cubes, cones, and other shapes. The holder of these objects feels an overwhelm­ ing urge to cast them into the shallow, cup­ like depression in the very center of the place. Suggest that their configuration might reveal answers to simple questions. If players nibble at this, hand them ldl2, 3d6 (of different colors), and 2d4. Explain that these are representative of the mystic counters of augury, and that they should cast them after asking some question. Use the results of the following charts to determine the answer to the question. If appropriate, read the message of the dice on the 3d6, using each d4 to resolve choices. (Add articles - the, an, a - as needed.) Use only the dl2 if the answer is a yes-or-no type. Be sure to study all of the dice before replying. Answers are nonsense, of course, though some might actually be applicable by sheer chance.

Counterweighted by sand­ bags, the secret door rises in one round. 0JtiGiIIAL ADVEIITVRJOS REiIICAR_IIATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEIITAL EVIL 144. HALL OF TRIANGLES This corridor is sheathed in polished brown marble, veined with black. Inlaid in the floor are triangular pieces of polished yellow marble, forming a definite path leading around the corner to the north. The brown of the marble shades toward beige as it proceeds northwards, but deepens to a dark chocolate hue south­ ward. Large bronze cresets are staggered at 10' intervals on either side of the hal; someone or something obviously keeps them fueled and burning brightly. 145. THE EARTH TEMPLE Note: Read the entire description carefully before starting play in this area. This great open area is obviously the one in which the principle of the Elemental Evil of Earth is served. The walls are rough-hewn sandstone, but the entire floor is dark brown earth. Some sort of phosphorescent lichen provides a dim illumination throughout the vast area. It grows on walls and ceil­ ing, supports and arches. Cressets and wall sconces indicate that, during cere­ monies, other light sources are used. In the center of the room, occupying a 20' square area, is a pyramid of hard­ packed dirt; the sides rise about six feet, and the top is flat, forming an area about six feet square. Stone steps are set in the four faces of the pyramid. Atop it is a stone column, each of its four faces bear­ ing a carved triangle and sporting a pair of bronze manacles dangling from bolted rings. At the base of the south face of the column rests a bronze box. Three doors are in the south wall; those to the left and right are normal, but the center pair are huge bronze valves. These bear a strange set of silvery­ glowing runes, obviously chiseled into their face by someone other than their maker. They are sealed shut, with soft iron filling all the cracks. The normal doors on the south wall lead to areas 145 F and 145 G, described after this Temple area. The depth of the earth in this room is six feet. The bronze box by the column is not locked; it contains a bronze maul, knife, bowl, and ewer. All of these items are evil, and detectably so; each item (including the box) is worth 25 gp. As with the main entrance of the Upper Temple, the n the large pair of doors are an antipathy spell, made permanent upon them. All those who failed any previous saving throw against this effect cannot approach the doors; any intruder whose saving throws were successful must here again make a saving throw vs. spells, with the usual -2 penalty, or suffer the effects. Four earth elementals are here, hidden under the dirt floor at four points (indicated by the letters A, B, C, and D on the map). An elemental attacks any victim within ten feet of it, and ceases attacking immediately when and if this situation ends. Elementals (4): AC 2, MV 6w, HD 16, hp A - 87, B = 74, C = 71, D = 69, #AT l, D 4-32, SD + 2 weapon to hit; XP 4155, 3960, 3915, 3885 A holy word or wish dispels all of the ele­ mentals, but otherwise they must be fought and slain to rid the area of their presence. A dispel magic does not affect them. If an intruder enters this room further that 20 feet from any entrance, all four ele­ mentals rise up out of the earth and stand motionless. If the intruder tries to leave, the elementals start patrolling, as follows. Four roman numerals surround each letter; each elemental moves first to I, then II, III, IV, I (etc.), taking one round for each "leg" of the trip. The elementals continue this patrol as long as any living thing remains in the area. If all intruders manage to depart, the ele­ mentals return to their original positions (the letters) and burrow back down, leaving no trace of their patrol or presence. If all intruders move directly to the cen­ tral pyramid (instead of attempting escape), the elementals do not patrol. Instead, they all move to their IV positions near the pyra­ mid) and do not move again for 1 tum, unless approached (activating their "attack reflex"). The elementals do not climb the pyramid in any case. After their 1 tum of immobility, any elemental that has not had 1 ewerful of blood poured upon it actively pursues intruders, reaching up towards those upon the pyramid, if applicable. (Intruders thereon must be careful of stray­ ing too close to the edge . . . .  ) EXCEPTION: Anyone wearing the robe of Romag (the brown vestment with the 55 four triangles set with gems) can move freely among the elementals without suffer­ ing attack. The wearer can furthermore command their movements by verbal instructions in the Common tongue (though they cannot leave this Temple). Buried under the dirt at each of the IV positions is great treasure. The digging of any one area takes 12 man-turns, i.e. 2 turns for 6 persons, 3 turns for 4 persons, etc. No more than six persons can excavate one area at the same time. Nothing is found in any dig until after one full turn of work, regard­ less of the number of participants. The first area excavated and searched produces 800 gp and a flask, a potion of diminution. The second area produces 200 pp and a suit of ring mail + 1. The third area produces 28 brown spinels (each worth 100 gp) and a morning star + 1. The fourth and last area excavated and searched produces a ring of protection + 1, rope of climbing, a leather case containing a wand of paralyzation (38 charges), and a brass box containing three jars of Keoghtom's ointment. 145 F. WEST ROOM This is probably a robing room, with no exit save the door you have opened. A padded bench runs the length of the east wall of this 10' square room. A number of pegs and hooks are along the north and south walls, and a large cabinet stands by the west wall. Seven cloaks of brown cloth are hanging on the pegs, and three pairs of sandals are tucked under the bench. The cloaks and sandals are human-sized. In the cabinet are eight padlocks and their keys (each set worth 1-4 gp to any Thieves' Guild), several large jars of wine, twelve pewter drinking cups, five plates with small amounts of different sorts of dirt (red, yel­ low, brown, black, and pale gray), an ivory bracelet set with a huge carnelian (worth 500 gp), and a bone scroll case. The last con­ tains a scroll of protection from earth ele­ mentals, a 10 ' radius effect produced after six segments of reading; the effect lasts for 5- 40 (5d8) rounds, but fully blocks only 24 Hit Dice of elementals, thus stopping only one such creature (but giving a -8 AC bonus against the attack of a second). 0RiGiilAL ADVEilTV'S REiilCAR..IlATED • THE TEJl:PLE 0F ELEJl:EllTA.L EVIL 145 G. EAST ROOM A heap of large and small stones fills the center of this 10' square room. Piles of dif­ ferent types of dirt are in the comers and along the walls, and only a narrow path through the room remains clear. Twelve small kegs are stacked along the south wall, three across and four high. You se no exit, save the door you have opened. The rocks are worthless, and one is actually a stone of weight. The dirt is just that. The kegs are filled with fuel oil for the cressets; each holds just a bit more than seven gallons (worth about 16 gp per gallon). On the inside face of the door (and probably unde­ tected while the door is open) is a parchment bearing a message, in Common. It instructs Romag to pay his fealty to the Water Ele­ mental Temple or else prepare to die horri­ bly. It reminds him that the relative power of their elements is reflected in the predomi­ nance of water to land. Several obscene remarks have been added to the missive, probably by Romag . . . . 146. PIT CHAMBER A relatively short flight of stairs leads down to a 20' long walkway, 10 ' wide. To the north of the walkway is a pit, 20 ' square and 10' deep. The floor of the pit is slimy and covered with bones and filth. The rough stone walls are pocked with small openings near the floor, but they become smooth and unclimbable four feet above the floor of the pit. If more than 100 pounds of weight are on the walkway while no weight is on the lower stairs, a trap in sprung. The walkway is bal­ anced in a cupped socket, and the weight upon it causes the ledge and seven feet of the wall behind it to tilt sharply down to the north. The smooth stone offers no hold to the hapless victims, each of whom takes 1-6 points of damage from falling into the pit. With the weight gone, the pivoting ledge swivels back to its original position. At the sound of victims falling into the pit, 24 giant rats rush out from their wall burrows, being trained to attack after that stimulus. Victims lose all shield and dexter­ ity bonuses to armor class in the first round, as well as initiative, but combat is normal thereafter. Each round, 24 more rats rush out and attack, until all 144 have arrived. Giant Rats (144): AC 7, MV 12 "//6", HD 1/z, hp 4, 3, 2, 1 (36 of each), #AT 1, D 1- 3, SA 8 carry disease, XP 11 (x36), 10 (x36), 9 (x36), 8 (x36) The rats have no treasure, but 1-12 of each coin type (cp, sp, ep, gp, pp) lie scattered under the litter on the floor. Searchers find one coin per person per round until all are discovered. 147. ROOM, 20' x 20' Three bugbears are on guard in this room. They are gaolers and know nothing of the secret door in the west wall. Their master, the human turnkey (area 152), is away. They fight until they se that the situation is hopeless, and then attempt to escape or surrender.

Each carries 2-16 sp, 2-16 ep, and 2-16 gp. This plain room contains little of inter­ est. A peg shoved between the blocks of stone on the west wall holds a robe of dull black cloth adorned with a pale brown pattern, a pair of triangles one atop the other. In the southeast comer of the room stands an old battered table with two chairs, a stool, and a bench (along its south edge) clustered around it. A cask is on the table, with some earthenware mugs and bits and pieces of food. Three torches bum in wall sconces, and eight fresh ones lie on the floor. An open cupboard in the northeast comer displays old plates, several mugs, lumpy sacks, and a string of small dried sau­ sages. A large water barrel stands near the southwest comer, opposite the door. The cask on the table holds two gallons of beer. The lumpy sacks in the cupboard con­ tain only hard biscuits. 148. PROCESSIONAL CORRIDOR This 20' wide passage is sheathed in marble, veined with black. Its hue dark­ ens as one proceeds to the south. Cres- 56 sets are regularly spaced along the corri­ dor's length, but they are unlit except to the far north. At the angle turn, the walls are decorated with painted scenes show­ ing captives of all sorts suffering death by water, wind, and fire. The pictures seem to emit a fiery glow when watched. Broad steps descend at the southern­ most point. The murals at each of the angle turns (just west and east of areas 145 F and G, respec­ tively) are painted in luminous pigments, producing the eerie glowing but non­ magical effect. Careful examination of the scenes reveals that one figure is a robed cleric with an inset triangle of bronze, obvi­ ously a priest of the Elemental Earth Tem­ ple. The broad steps lead down to another pair of bronze doors, protected by the antipathy effect. (See Upper Works main entrance for diagram and full details, or area 145 for a brief synopsis.) 149. GUARD ROOM The pit trap outside each southern door to this room activates when stepped upon, dropping one victim ten feet (for 1-6 points of damage). The pit walls are smooth and not climbable by anyone in heavy armor without assistance. Anyone aware of the pits (such as the residents herein) can walk carefully around their sides, avoiding problems. Eighteen guards (Level 0 men-at-arms) are quartered at this key point, with three leaders (Level 3 Fighters). Guards defeated in random encounters (maximum of six in a patrol party, plus one Level 3 leader) came from this spot, and casualties must be deducted from the orig­ inal numbers given here. All of the guards are armed and ready, and all have missile weapons (half with light crossbows, half with javelins). If alerted by noise to the south of the room (such as the operation of a pit trap), they observe by using spy holes in the doors, and may tum valves at the wall basin (location X on the map) to flood the pits. They stay ready to attack intruders not destroyed by the pits. If appropriate, one leader takes half of the troops to circle around to attack intruders from the rear, using the secret door to circle north or the longer route through the nor­ mal door (at the end of the southwest diago­ nal corridor) to circle south. In any engagement, guards try to dis- 0NGiIIAL A.DVEIITVJU;S REiIICA1'_IIATED • THE TEitlPLE 0F ELEitlEIITA.L EVIL charge one missile volley, drop their cross­ bows, and close to melee with swords drawn. Leaders hold back to throw their spare javelins, and may replace casualties in the front line, flank intruders, or pick up and use dropped crossbows. Guards (12-18): AC 4, MV 9 ", Level 0, hp 4 each, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword), SA half with javelins (D 1-6, ranges 2 "/4 "/6"), half with light crossbows (D 2-5); XP 18 each Leader (2-3): AC 4, MV 9", Level 3 Fighter, 24, 21, 20, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword), SA 2 javelins each (D 1-6, ranges 2 "/4 "/6 "), each with Strength 17 ( + 1 "to hit" I + 1 damage); each leader commands six guards; XP 122, 113, 110 Each guard wears chain mail armor and car­ ries a shield. The shield and the normal garb are adorned with the brown and black trian­ gle of the Earth Temple. Each leader is armored in like fashion, and wears a neck­ lace from which hangs a bronze medallion with a raised triangle (worth 20 gp). Each guard carries 1-6 sp and 1-6 ep. Each leader has 2-12 ep, 2-12 gp, and 2-12 pp. The light in this 30' square room comes from four torches, one on each wall, and several large candles standing on long trestle tables. Also on the tables, which are flanked by benches, are food, drink, and knucklebones. The dishes and ves­ sels are ordinary pottery. Narrow three­ tiered bunks line the north, east, and west walls. The unadorned walls and weapons racks indicate that this room was originally allocated as a place for guards. The racks are full of various weapons and shields. A fountain in the south wall flows into a wall basin, under which are four large knobs. The weapons racks hold 12 spears, 6 jave­ lins, 4 shortswords, 3 hand axes, and 8 shields. The large knobs under the basin are the controls for flooding the pit traps. 150. CELLS This seems to be a line of gaol cells. Each door has a small barred window, and a large lock and bar as well. Use the following general description for each cell, adding prisoner notes (below). Note that the doors on the east walls of cells a, b, and c cannot be seen or opened from inside a cell. Careful inspection reveals a tiny opening in each, and probing gives a metallic sound (when the probe meets the cover of the spy hole; see further notes for area 151). The cell is 10 ' square, with closely set stone blocks in wall and floor; the ceiling is actually hewn from living rock. Straw litters the floor, and chains hang from the far wall. A small drain is in the center of the floor. When a door is opened, the inside is found to be covered with a sheet of rusty iron. No cell contains any treasure. Eastern Rooms: The doors of cells a, b, and c are neither locked nor barred, but as long as they remain shut, their "ragged human" occu­ pants (three zombies in each) stay huddled in their straw, appearing as captives and (of course) not speaking. All three zombies of a cell attack if their door is opened. Zombies (9, 3 per cell): AC S, MV 6 ", HD 2, hp 10 each, #AT 1, D 1-8, SD 1/2 dam­ age from stabbing weapons; automati­ cally lose initiative; XP 40 each Western Rooms: The doors to cells d, e, and f are locked and barred. Cells d and f are empty. Cell e con­ tains one gnome, bound and gagged and chained to the far wall. The turnkey (see area 152) is not positive that this character isn't able to use some form of magic, and so keeps him gagged except during feeding times (once per day). The gnome's name is Wonnilon. He came to this place to get treasure, of course, since he was flat broke. He is Neutral, and claims to be a fighter (but is also a thief). If freed, equipped, and well treated, he considers staying with the party, as the characters seem powerful (they have, after all, pene­ trated this far) and therefore promise plenty in the way of treasure. If not given a fair share of the proceeds, Wonillon steals to make up the difference. If badly treated, he waits his chance for a good opportunity, steals as much treasure and magic as possi­ ble, and sneaks away to leave the Nulb area entirely. 57 Wonillon, Level 4/4 Fighter/Thief, hp 23 S 17 I 12 W 9  0 17 Co 16 Ch lO AC 7 (no armor), #AT 1, D 0 (no weapons), SA by professions, SD by race; XP 363 151. SECRET CORRIDOR This passage shows disuse; it is dusty, dirty, and filled with cobwebs. However, someone wearing boots has made use of the place with fair frequency, as shown by occasional tracks. Three iron doors line the west wall, each with great hinges set to bear the weight of such portals. Each also has a small iron hatch. An old gray blanket hangs on the east wall. The hatch on each door can slide to the right, producing a spy hole through which one may se into the cell beyond. Behind the blanket is a small alcove with a cot, small table, chair, lantern, 12 flasks of oil, a barrel (one quarter filled with wine), foodstuffs (the equivalent of three normal rations), some old clothing on pegs in the wall, an iron chest, and a heap of glittering equipment. The pile is Wonnilon's adven­ turing gear, including leather armor, a shortsword, backpack, miscellaneous items, and a very f>lain-looking but magical dagger + 2 (in a scabbard). From these con­ tents one might assume (correctly) that this is the residence of the turnkey (who is pres­ ently in area 152). The chest is secured by a large padlock. Inside are 411 cp, 151 sp, 90 ep, 55 gp, 27 pp, and a small wooden box. Inside this box are two potions of healing, which the turn­ key saves for use on particularly choice vic­ tims . . . . 152. 10RTURE CHAMBER The solid door to this area is not locked, and can be opened easily and quietly if care is taken. The turnkey and his bugbear assist­ ant are here busily engaged in torturing a human on a rack, and will therefore proba­ bly be surprised (1-4 on ld6) by careful and quiet invaders. Turnkey: AC 2, MV 9 ", Level 5 Fighter, hp 30, #AT 1, D 2-9 (battle axe); XP 240 Bugbear: AC 3, MV 9", HD 3 + 1, hp 22, #AT 1, D 1-8 (flail); XP 223 0NGiilAL A.DVEilTVRJ:S REiilCAR...IlATED • THE TEDIPLE 0F ELEDIEilTA.L EVIL The turnkey is wearing chain mail armor, and has 16 Strength and 17 Dexterity (the damage and AC bonuses for which are included in the statistics above). He wears a bronze ring with a triangular setting of jet (worth 50 gp), and has 23 gp in his purse. Inside a hidden pocket in his surcoat are four tourmalines (worth 100 gp each). The bugbear is wearing a chain mail shirt and leather jack with metal plates. In its purse are 1-6 sp, 1-6 ep, 1-6 pp, and a rock crystal (worth SO gp). Their victim is a man-at-arms, who was recently taken in a raid which netted other captives (see below). He refused to join the Temple fighters, and so is to be slowly killed here and then fed to the gnolls. Victim: AC 10, Level 0, hp 3 (originally 6); XP 13 Lurid light from a flaming cresset and a glowing brazier full of charcoal reveals a 30'x 20' chamber containing a rack, iron maiden, cage, and all the other unspeakable devices common to a tor­ ture chamber. Two adjacent 10' square alcoves, one to the south and one east, are barred, their doors held fast by chain and padlock. Two prisoners are in each, obviously here to await the tender mer­ cies of the torturers. Two female humans are in the south alcove, and two ores in the east. The humans are mere country folk, taken in a recent raid. They ask to be shown an exit from the dungeon so that they may return to their homes. The ores join and fight with the party if given arms (being Lawful and opposed to the Temple followers, despite their evil natures) though they desert in any tough situation. They know a way to get to the level below (area 153) and the route to stairs up (near the south end of the level map, east and west sides). · 153. SPIRAL STAIR This 10' wide spiral staircase circles clockwise down a shaft 20 feet in diame­ ter. The stairs have no rail, but otherwise appear safe and sound. This staircase leads down to area 246 (Dungeon Level Two), an empty corridor intersection. Dungeon Level Two RANDOM ENCOUNTERS Roll ld % once per turn and refer to the fol­ lowing chart.

ROOM KEY 201. GREAT BRONZE GATE This site can be reached from Dungeon Level One by descending the ramp in area 109. The passage is barred by a huge sheet of bronze, the surface of which is covered with bas relief faces of evil leering crea­ tures. It is evidently placed to bar further progress north, though 10' wide corri­ dors lead east and west. This portal is too massive to even attempt to raise by brute strength. The gateway can be opened by no less than three consecutive knock spells - one each for locks, bars, and the gate itself. It can be raised normally from the northern side, using a windlass (see area 211). It has not been opened in several years, as no full­ ceremony sacrifices have been made since the Temple was overthrown. Note that this is not one of the four gates protected by the permanent antipathy effect to bind Zuggtmoy. 202. DOMED CHAMBER A five-headed hydra guards this chamber, bound by a leg chain. If any visible creature tries to enter, the hydra hisses loudly and strikes. This brings its keeper from area 203 in one round. The hydra has no treasure. Hydra: AC 5, MV 9 ", HD 5, hp 40 (8 per head), #AT 5, D 1-6 each; XP 365 This 40 ' diameter area has an arched ceiling some 30 feet high. Its polished 0RjGiilAL ADVEilTV'S REi ilCAR_IlATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EllTAL EVIL stones indicate that it was once meant for some special purpose, lost now under a litter of refuse, bones, and dung. A huge metal ring has been cemented into the center of the floor, and a heavy iron chain of about eight feet length is fas­ tened to the ring. 203. OLD S10REROOM The hydra's keeper, a troll, dwells here on orders from its master, the priest of the Fire Temple. Upon hearing any noise from its beast, it grabs its military fork and investi­ gates. Those with proper identification - robes of the Fire Temple or the eight-pointed amulet - can pass, for the troll then shoves the hydra aside and stops its heads from attacking by quick use of the weapon. The troll otherwise not only allows the beast to attack, but aids it, attacking with the weapon (which it can use long range, strik­ ing opponents up to ten feet distant and gaining a + 2 bonus to damage, due to Strength). If enemies close on it, the troll discards the weapon and attacks normally (tooth and claw). The troll's only treasure is a ring of fire resistance it wears.

Spilled con­ tents - flour, grain, broken crockery, and who knows what else - are mixed with old bones, broken furniture, splin­ tered wood, rags, and ordure up to a depth of at least a foot. The whole area stinks of troll. The containers hold nothing valuable, all being spilled, rotted, or spoiled, save a small cask holding two gallons of fuel oil (worth about 16 gp per gallon) and a box containing 20 fresh torches. 204. ROOM, 30' x 20' Five bugbears are stationed here as guards; two are on watch. In case of attack, the three resting in the western arm of the U­ shaped area arrive one round after the first two are engaged. Each bugbear throws a spear before engaging in melee with a morn­ ing star. If hard-pressed, one bugbear tries to rouse the clerics in area 205. Bugbears (5): AC 5, MV 9", HD 3 + 1, hp 17 each #AT 1, D 2-8 (morning star), SA 1 spear each (D 1-6, ranges l "/2 • /3 "); XP 203 each Each bugbear wears a short cape of crimson cloth. Each carries 2-12 gp, 2-12 ep, and 2- 12 sp. A fireplace on the east wall and a flowing fountain and basin on the west wall are the most remarkable features of this plas­ tered but unpainted chamber. A large table stands in the center of the room, flanked by a pair of benches; all are a bit too large to be comfortable to humans. A sizeable haunch of some sort of cold meat is on the table. An old barrel stands in the center of the north wall, and holds seven spears. Heaps of bedding lie along the ·south passageway to the west. 205. LUXURIOUS CHAMBER COMPLEX This complex consists of the following four rooms: 205a. Anteroom, occupied by a half-ore Cleric/Fighter (Levels 3/3) who is ready to reinforce the guards to the north (area 204) 205b. Main chamber, occupied by a human Curate (Level 4 Cleric) who is ready to reinforce the guards to the south (area 206) 59 205c. Western side room, occupied by a human Prefect (Level 5 Cleric) 205d. Eastern side room, unoccupied (the Curate's bedroom) The half-ore or the Curate (but not both) will aid guards, but will not disturb the pre­ fect unless absolutely necessary. Each of the three priests wears a gold amulet on a golden chain; the amulet depicts the symbol of Fire: 205a. ANTEROOM The half-ore priest herein is the liaison to the bugbear guards. He wears a red robe with a gold skull emblem, but with plate mail armor underneath, and carries a shield as well. His gold fire amulet on a gold chain is worth 100 gp. He wears a ring set with a large violet gar­ net (jewelry value 700 gp), and carries 11 ep, 16 gp, and 7 pp in his purse. Half-ore: AC 2 (plate & shield), MV 6", Level 3/3 Cleric/Fighter, hp 22, #AT l, D 3-6 (hammer), Strength 16 ( + 1 damage bonus included), SA spells; XP 315 First level: cause fear, cure light wounds, protection from good Second level: hold person This 10' square room is plastered but otherwise unadorned. It is lit by a lan­ tern and a burning torch, the latter on the east wall. The room contains a couch, writing table and chair, small bra­ zier, and a brass-bound chest; on the table are quills, an inkpot, and a roll of parchment. The locked chest holds garments, a potion of poison, and a leather bag containing 37 gp and 19 ep. 205b. MAIN CHAMBER The human Curate herein, assistant to the chief cleric, is sipping wine and relaxing. His crimson hooded robe has gold embroidered skulls on front and back; his golden chain and fire amulet are worth 100 gp. He wears chain mail armor and carries a shield, and also wears a ring of protection + 1. In the pommel of his mace is a small but carefully set ruby worth 1,00 gp. He keeps 14 ep, 9 gp, and 21 pp in his purse. 0IQGiilAL ADVEil'fV'S REiilCARJIATED • THE TE.lb:PLE 0F ELE.lb:EITTAL EVI L Curate: AC 1 (chain & shield), MV 9 ", Level 4 Cleric, hp 17, #AT 1, D 1-6 (mace), Dexterity 16 (-2 AC bonus included), SA spells, XP 243 Level 1: command, darkness, light, sanctu­ ary Level 2: hold person, silence 15' radius This 20'x 30' chamber is thickly strewn with rugs; carpets and tapestries cover the walls.

The colors are all bright - scarlet, hot orange, fiery gold, and brilliant blue. Small tables hold ewers and cups, and dishes of nuts and sweetmeats. A large box stands near the fireplace. The plastered ceiling is painted with scenes of demons and humans in lewd activities. Under a heap of pillows is a hooded robe of scarlet hue. One tapestry sewn with gold and silver thread is worth 2,00 gp, but the others have no worth. The ewers and cups are of pewter and small worth, and contain wine. The robe under the pillows is the garb of an important guest of the Fire Temple. The box by the fire­ place is filled with billets of wood, charcoal, and kindling for the maintenance of the fire. 205c. WESTERN SIDE ROOM This is the private chamber of the human Prefect Alrrem, chief cleric of the Fire Tem­ ple, who is here writing another ultimatum to Romag (area 137). Alrem knows that the priests of the Water Temple are close to forc­ ing the servants of the Air Temple to align against him. His written message states, thus far, "Your rewards will be great if you bend your knee to Fire. Bring all of your forces here to me now, and swear fealty. If you fail to heed this advice . .  :· Alrrem is des­ parate, for his faction (having lost power when it led the Temple to defeat) now has few adherents and no particular strength in troops; he needs the forces being gathered by the Earth Temple to counter those of the Air and Water Temples. Alrrem wears a robe of deep crimson with a purple lining and gold trim; it has gold skulls on front, back, and sleeves. His gold fire symbol (on golden chain) is set with a nice ruby (jewelry value 2,500 gp). He has a scroll of three spells in a tube at his belt (dis­ pel magic, flame strike, tongues), and car- ries 5 gp, 38 pp, and 4 zircons (worth 50 gp each) in his purse. He wears magical chain mail and shield, and carries two hammers - one normal (carried as a spell compo­ nent) and one hammer + 2.

It contains a large bed, two small side tables, a round table with four chairs, a stand with basin, ewer, and a small copper box, a wardrobe, and a brass brazier filled with brightly glowing coals and giving off wisps of sulphurous-smelling incense. A large brass chest with a heavy lock is at the foot of the bed. The chest holds clothing, a suit of normal chain mail armor, a normal mace, and a sack containing 100 gp. The top of the cop­ per box is inlaid with sardonyx, and the whole is worth 150 gp. It holds rare herbs worth 200 gp. The wardrobe holds a red silk robe with golden skulls on its back and sleeves, and with the eight-pointed fire sym­ bol piqued on its front in garnets (worth a total of 3,000 gp). 205d. EASTERN SIDE ROOM This eastern side room is 10 'x 20 ' and less lavishly furnished. It has a few tapes­ tries and several small rugs, torches burning in wall sconces, a small table with a candelabra, a couch, two chairs, a chest, and a brazier. A book lies open on a small stand near the couch. A few serv­ ing pieces of brass and copper are scat­ tered around, on the table and stand. The six serving pieces are worth 5 cp each. The chest holds clothing, a small silver box (worth 75 gp) containing 20 pp and a jew­ eled ring (worth 500 gp), and a bone scrollcase which holds a scroll of protection from devils. The book on the stand deals with the Elemental Plane of Fire, and men- 60 tions the fire elemental grue, the harginn. The reader learns the descriptive informa­ tion (but not the basic statistics) of this crea­ ture; read aloud from the entry in MM2, page 73. The book is non-magical but worth 500 gp (XP value 50). 206. AUDIENCE CHAMBER A human commander (LS fighter) and two bugbear guards are on guard here. Each bugbear carries a large spear to hurl before closing to melee; each wears a short cape of red cloth, and carries 3-24 gp. The fighter commands the few forces at the beck and call of the Fire Temple - the troll (area 203), various bugbears, were­ wolves (area 208 et al.), and ogres. He com­ mands their respect through his own ability, that of the clerics, and his robe of entangle­ ment, which is coiled and kept at his belt. When fighting, he uses it in his left hand, and a sword + 1 flametongue (NSA) in his right. He wears banded armor + 1 but pre­ fers not to use a shield. On his gold chain is an eight-pointed fire amulet with a large inset garnet (jewelry value 750 gp). He car­ ries a purse containing 6 ep, 20 gp, and 6 pp. In the pockets of his dark red cloak are 8 banded agates, 5 tiger eyes, and 6 pieces of good turquoise (each gem worth 10 gp).

The many cresets and candelabras are unlit. Colors here are hot, bright ones - reds, oranges, and yellows. The tapestries on the walls depict scenes of the triumph of the Elemental Evil of Fire. Cushions, low tables, and stools are all about, but only one chair is here - a huge wooden seat, laquered red and gilt. A gold skull appears on the arm rests and above the back. The arched entry to the northwest passage is covered by hangings and a folding screen. 0ajGiilAL ADVEilTV'S REi ilCAR..IlATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EilTAL EVIL 207. PEARLESCENT ROOM No detect spell other than detect magic works in this room. The latter finds the whole room radiating a dim magical essence, with a more powerful dweomer coming from the crystal sheet (see below). The floor here is of white marble, the walls and vaulted ceiling sheathed in pearly alabaster. There is a "right feel" to the place, as a place of safety in a storm of evil. The room is bare and clean. A sheet of cloudy crystal substance seems to be set into the northern portion of the east wall. As you look, it begins to brighten, its radiance actually lighting the room! Two manlike creatures with wings of snowy feathers and radiant faces, robed in purest white, appear amidst golden tinted, cloud-like billows. A pale blue sky can be seen behind them. They first peer out at you, and then one speaks in dulcet tones, "What are fair and just folk such as you doing in this foul place of pain and base wickedness?" At this point, prompt answers from the party through further utterances from the angelic duo. Threaten a bolt for any "servant of Evil" daring to enter this "sanctuary of Good:' After suficient questioning, the two figures smile benignly upon the viewers. They relate that their attention extends to this place because, when the Temple was overthrown, luz (in His generosity and renowned kindness) placed this haven here, so that opponents of the Tem­ ple might find refuge in need and gain help against their foes. The brighter of the two radiant figures now speaks again. "Now, good folk, place each and every weapon you pos­ sess, all of your holy symbols, magic items, silvered items, and magical herbs before this crystal - the Window of the Planes of Weal - and then quickly step out of the west door. Count slowly to 77, and do not return in that time, for we shall send a Ray of Just Might through these items. Any flesh in the place would be blasted to oblivion by the ray, and any mortal eye beholding its glory would be forever blinded. But all your items will be made more effective by a factor of + 1, recharged by seven, or otherwise doubled in efficacy - though this power lasts but seven hours. Hurry! We must act now, for our time is fast running out. We can help but once per seven days, you know!" If the party hesitates, the crystal slowly darkens into cloudy obscurity after one round. If the party complies with the requests, refer to 208 below. The crystal is a magical one-way mirror, protected by a powerful and permanent force field which makes it impervious to harm by anything less than a godling. Nothing can be seen in or behind it, even passwall and glassee being useless against its mighty dweomer. 208. SECRET ROOM Two werewolves lair here. They serve the Fire Temple, bringing loot and victims to Alrrem (area 205c). The crystal sheet of area 207 is also visible here if a covering of gray cloth is pulled aside. It is a lens of transfor­ mation, actually placed here for evil pur­ poses by Iuz (see Appendix C). Upon hearing noise in the adjoining room (area 207), the werewolves stand before the lens, being seen by those on the other side as angelic figures. They see through the crystal normally. If the party balks at disarming themselves, the creatures step away from the device and wait to surprise anyone entering their secret door, just in case. If the party cooperates, the monsters rush through to room 207, gather up the items left, and quickly take them to their lair. Then (and only then) do they return to room 207, in person, to deal with the (hope­ fully) defenseless party. Those who surren­ der are taken to area 206 (and then to 205). Corpses are devoured by the werewolves. The lens cannot be removed from the wal by mundane means. If a wish is used, it is either be loosened (25% chance) or shatters (75%); if the latter result occurs, luz immedi­ ately knows what happened and who did it!

A pair of nest­ like heaps of cloth and pillow lie by the east wall; bones and litter cover the 61 floor. A large cupboard stands against the north wall. A pair of rust-red cloaks hang on pegs by the secret door, the only apparent entrance. A few pieces of dirty pewterware are on the cupboard shelves, along with two bottles of wine and a bunch of cooking herbs in a glass bottle. You notice a jumble of weapons and other items in the northwest corner. The dirty pewterware is actually silver, 15 items worth 10-60 gp each. The bottled herbs are 18 sprigs of wolfsbane. The cupboard cab­ inet holds a dager + 1, a short sword + 11 + 3 vs. lycanthropes and shapechangers, and five silver daggers, under which is a scroll of protection from lycanthropes (al) flat and upside-down, as if shelf-paper. Under a loose floor stone, found only after a careful search, is a hole containing 1,629 sp. The pile in the corner contains various odds and ends of adventuring gear (but no food or water), plus the following: 22 arrows, normal 19 arrows, silver-tipped 1 bow, long 2 bows, short 4 crossbows, light 4 crossbow bolt cases (empty) 82 crossbow bolts 5 daggers 1 flail 1 hammer 1 holy symbol, normal 3 holy symbols, silvered 1 mace 2 mirrors, silvered 1 morning star 3 quivers (empty) 3 spears 1 sword, long 2 swords, short 209. PROCESSIONAL CORRIDOR The walls of this 20' wide passage are painted with scenes of gross evil, death, and destruction. Some also depict parties of worshippers and their sacrificial cap­ tives; each is led by a robed cleric. The great doors along the southern part of each wal are polished brass, with many more vile scenes and runes. Huge rings hang from their centers, for opening and closing. 0NGiIIAL A.DVEII'f'V'S REiIICAR__IIA'f'ED • THE TElhPLE 0F ELElhEilTA.L EVIL Close inspection of the walls reveals inset sym­ bols of bronze adorning the pictures of the priests - a square on a figure wearing silvery gray robes, a circle on a gren-robed cleric, and an eight-pointed device on the figure in red. The hinges of the huge doors are well­ greased, and this is also discernable with study. A spell keeps the doors from tarnishing. 209a. SECRET CORRIDOR This dusty passage connects areas 209 and 225 (Kelno's residence). A gargoyle fountain on the northwest diagonal wall spurts milky but potable water into a stone basin. The north branch leads to a stairway, which curves counter-clockwise as it descends to area 314 (Dungeon Level Three). 210. OCTAGONAL CHAMBER If the bronze doors in area 145 (Dungeon Level One) are sundered, the stairs therein descend south to this room. However, entry is blocked by another set of like doors, set in the north wall of this area. Illumination in this large octagonal room seems to come from everywhere - ceil­ ing, walls, floor - a milky radiance which gives a dim and eerie glow to the whole scene. The floor of this place is 15 ' below the level of the normal dungeon floor, with short broad stairways leading to it. The ceiling vaults to a height of 40 feet. The walls and floor of the room are of polished gray stone with whorls of glittering mica; the floor is partially obscured by swirling, eddying, softly glowing mist. In the center of the area is a great pierced square of bronze, ten fet on a side. A dome is pierced in the northern ceiling, a circular shaft some 20 feet wide opening directly over a pit of the same diameter and five feet depth. Immediately to the south of the pit is a block of alabaster two fet wide, four feet high, and eight feet long. Atop it are two knives and a bowl of finest crystal. Flanking the pit are two crystal braziers, suspended from tripods by chains of silver. Each emits a faint sickly-sweet perfumed smoke. The doors to the north are bronze, sealed with iron, chained, barred, and bear a warning inscription in runes of some sort. The altar stone and crystal service pieces are protected by a special glyph of warding suit­ able to the place. They cannot be safely touched unless the symbol of the Air Temple is worn and the glyph name, whah-duh, is spoken. Failure in either requirement causes a whirlwind to suddenly form and spin from the pit to the altar, inflicting 12 points of damage to each creature within ten feet of its path (save vs. spells to take half damage). This also triggers an alarm; the whole area gives off an evil-sounding chiming and tin­ kling, and the guardian (see area 210a) is summoned. The two crystal knives are worth 250 gp each; the bowl, 1,250 gp. If the braziers are disturbed, they begin pouring out clouds of dense, choking smoke which fills 20,00 cubic feet of volume each round, continuing for 11-20 rounds. This vapor is heavier than air, and thus builds from the floor upwards. Treat it as a wall of fog, though each victim within it takes 5-8 points of damage per round from smoke inhalation. After ten rounds of outpouring smoke, any creature within the pit is tele­ ported to the Air Cavern (area 526). If holy water is poured into a brazier, a Type I demon is instantly summoned and attacks everyone within the room. (Note that, with two braziers, two demons may be summoned.) Pouring any other sort of liq­ uid into a brazier causes the smoke to be twice as voluminous and twice as harmful for one round (after which output and toxic­ ity return to normal). Each brazier is worth 10,00 gp, and functions in perfectly normal manner once removed from this Air Temple. The secret door to the west opens to a flight of steps to area 301 (Dungeon Level Three). The doors to the north bear the familiar runes of antipathy. Anyone failing any prior saving throw against the effect (found also in the main Temple entrance aboveground, as well as certain areas within the dungeon) can­ not approach the doors; anyone making al prior saving throws must again, when approaching within ten feet, make a saving throw vs. spell, (with a -2 penalty) to avoid this effect. 210a. GUARDIAN This area quarters a drelb, the guardian of the Air Temple. (See Appendix A, New Monsters, for a full description.) The room is otherwise empty - but a careful search reveals that a section of floor is movable, being a secret trap door. The small space 62 underneath holds a censer of controlling air elementals. Drelb guardian: AC 2, MV 6 ", HD 5 + 3, hp 24, #AT 1, D 3-12, SA appears as wraith, shrinks while attacking (90% seems retreating), touch chills (victim hit drops items, cannot function the round there­ after), SD hit only by magic weapons, reflects psionic attacks; XP 944 211. CORRIDOR OF THE ELEMENTS This 20 ' wide passageway is strangely lit by some obviously magical means. In the center and the short northern extension, it pulses with a disgusting gray luminos­ ity; to the west it glows with a green radi­ ance; and to the east, bands of dull red light seem to float in the air. Each pair of double doors (to the north, west, and east) is a great brass construction, cov­ ered with horrible scenes and leering faces. To the south is a huge slab of bronze, a solid portcullis. A mighty windlass flanking it to the east obviously raises and lowers this barrier. The designs in the corridor are very similar to those in the Processional Corridors (areas 209). The windlass is secured with a chain and huge padlock, and a bar is across the gate - unless, of course, either or both have been opened. The central 20 ' square at the intersection is "safe," but not so the corridors. Any movement out of the safe area causes the walls of the corridor entered to glow brightly, and elemental forces (see the fol­ lowing descriptions) are felt. For each ten feet of travel, 1-6 points of elemental dam­ age is inflicted; each victim may make a sav­ ing throw vs. spells each time this occurs, and success indicates that no damage is taken. Note that any victim carrying or wearing the appropriate Temple symbol automatically succeeds in each of these sav­ ing throws. East: Walls glow fiery red; the smells of sul­ fur, burning flesh, and hot metal assault the nostrils. Victims take heat damage. West: Walls, floor and ceiling shed a deep green gloom. Movement is slowed to 3 "  rate (as if moving underwater). A moist reek of seaweed and rotting fish pervades the air. Victims take damage as if drowning. 0NGi ITAL A.DVEITTV'S REi ITCAR_IlATED • THE TEllrPLE 0F ELEllrEllTA.L EVIL North: A great rush of moaning and shriek­ ing wind strikes the party. It oddly and undescribably smells like the winds of age, war, and death. Victims take cold damage and are blown backward 30 feet; each also takes 1-6 points of impact damage when hit­ ting the gate (unless it has been opened). 212. THE TEMPLE OF FIRE If anyone enters by either pair of bronze doors, a permanent unseen servant slams them shut behind the visitors. There can be no doubt that this huge hall of red granite, lit by scores of flambeaux and pervaded by the odor of heated metal and sulfur, is the Fire Temple. The great doors of beaten brass reflect the leaping flames. Tapestries adorn the walls of the north (wider) section, depict­ ing scenes of fire in evil form. Despite the many torches and flaming cressets, the air seems to carry motes of rust-colored luminescence, and the streaks of blue and mica flakes in the polished granite walls appear to leap and dance as if flames, caught within the rock. A brass tube, 20' long and 2 '  in diam­ eter, is suspended from the ceiling by chains of the same metal. Just to the north of it is a shallow fire pit; and to either side of the tube are low stands of brass, upon wŅich are many small blocks of charcoal. To either hand, east and west beyond lines of pillars, are great copper cauldrons, flanking the main area of the Temple. Before each such vessel is an octagonal brass table; on each table are 16 bowls and a copper dipper. Continue if the southern (main) Temple is entered. A glance into the huge pots finds them filled with some sort of glowing amber liquid. At the south end of the Temple stands a translucent block of golden apa­ tite, three feet wide and high and nine feet long. Skulls grin from its sides, their forms inlaid with hammered gold. Atop the altar is the eight-pointed fire symbol (illustrated in area 205), set in wrought gold. Before this altar is a fire pit of dia­ mond shape, ten feet long north-south and eight feet broad. It appears to be sev­ eral feet deep, and its bottom is covered with glowing hot coals. Tiny forms sem to cavort atop these coals - perhaps small denizens of the Elemental Plane of Fire. If a block of charcoal incense is placed in the fire pit, it instantly bursts aflame, and the tube - a great bell - sounds loudly, calling the priests and indicating that faithful wor­ shippers wish to sacrifice to the Elemental Evil of Fire . . . .  The priests in area 205 cer­ tainly respond to the noise, if still alive. Six skulls adorn the apatite altar at the south; each weighs 100 gp. The wrought gold design on the altar can be pried off (weight 500 gp). Anyone entering the deep fire pit by the altar takes 4-24 points of fire damage each round (minimum 1-6 for even a touch) unless magically protected; no saving throw applies. With magical protection, the intruder takes no damage the first round, and only 1-6 points per round thereafter (again, however, with no saving throw). Items placed within the fire must be saved for each round, and vs. fireball rather than normal fire (due to the intensity of the heat). When anything or anyone enters the fire pit, the salamanders (see below) start to grow. The amber liquid in the great copper caul­ drons is fine scented oil with continual light in each. Approved supplicants are to fill a bowl to pour upon the altar. If any material other than copper touches the oil, a sala­ mander appears in the cauldron, igniting the oil and causing a wave of heat that inflicts 2- 12 points of fire damage on each victim within five feet; the salamander then attacks the defiler of the "unholy oil:' If the altar is touched prior to pouring the golden oil upon it, a sheet of flame expands out 5 feet from the altar in all directions, inflicting 10 points of fire damage to each victim (no saving throw). This causes a magic mouth on the central skull to bellow 'WHO DARES DEFILE THE SACRED ELE­ MENTAL FIRE?!" and the noise attracts clerics and guards nearby (if any). If oil is poured upon the altar, a magic mouth on the central skull speaks in com­ mon, commanding that the faithful now offer major sacrifice. At this, the flames of the fire pit leap higher, each appearing as a miniature salamander. Visitors must now either depart or make a sacrifice, placing a valuable treasure (worth 500 gp or more) or living creature in the fire pit, and leaving it there until destroyed. Failure to sacrifice 63 causes salamanders - 16 of them! - to grow to full size in four rounds. However, only four salamanders are real; the others are mirror images. Salamanders (4): AC 5/3, MV 9 ", HD 7 + 7, hp 44, 41, 40, 37, #AT 2, D 1-6/2-12 (spear and constriction), SA 1-6 heat damage added to each attack, SD + 1 or better weapon to hit; XP 1265, 1235, 1225, 1195 The salamanders cannot move or attack until they reach full size, but thereafter can even leave the fire pit to take appropriate actions. Each has a spear of red-hot bronze. The fire in the fire pit is magical and of evil nature. Water only causes steam and vapor to arise from the coals, effectively causing a wall of Fog filling the south Temple area and lasting one round per gallon of water applied. Holy water quenches one cubic foot of burning coals per vial, but unless all the coals are so quenched, the dead portion flames again one tum later. A pyrotechnics spell may be applied with effect, using up the coals in producing the effect, but the coals gain a saving throw of 20 minus the level of the caster; for example, a roll of 16 or better would resist such an effect from a 5th level caster. If the saving throw is successful, the spell has no effect. Affect normal fires likewise has no effect if used to reduce the flames, but if used to enlarge the fire, the coals bum brightly for four rounds and then become absolutely cool for another four, after which they burst into glowing heat once again. Beneath the glowing coals of the fire pit is a locked iron box; however, it cannot be found until after 5-8 rounds of searching, detect magic or other magical aid notwith­ standing. The box is trapped with a scythe blade; when any item is lifted from the bot­ tom of the box, the razor-sharp blade neatly cuts through anything (no saving throw). Any item struck is ruined; a hand thus removed may only be replaced by applica­ tion of a regenerate spell. In the box are two potions of fire resistance, a ring of fire resist­ ance, and a longsword that does not glow. The latter is, however, a frost brand + 31 + 6 vs. fire creatures. It is Lawful Good (Int 16, Ego 17) and speaks common, fire giant, red dragon, and salamander; its primary powers are detect evil, detect magic, detect shifting walls and rooms, and it has an extraordinary power of levitation.

HALL OF VERDIGRIS This huge hall, 40 ' x  90' , has an arched ceiling some 30 feet overhead. The many buttresses and arches form a tracery of shadowy dimness; the ceiling's exact height is not discernible. The floor and walls are covered in slabs of polished stone, apparently azurite-malachite from the swirls of blue intermingled with the deep green. Some magic has evi­ dently been placed here, for a soft cloudy greenish luminosity seeps from the walls and floor, seemingly floating in the air, making the whole chamber appear as if deep underwater. This impression is enhanced by the bronze doors, fountain, · and other work; all are covered with ver­ digris. Even the damp air seems to smell of the sea. Several weird things in this place come to your immediate attention. In the middle of the west wall is a great sheet of bronze, a bas relief of an under­ water vista - seaweed, shells, and vari­ ous forms of marine life. The head of a fish-like thing projects from this, a most hideous visage. Its ghastly maw emits a stream of water, which falls into a tiered series of four basins. The fourth and largest never overflows, so it must have a drain system somewhere. Near the mid-portion of the hall, some 40 feet distant from the east wall and 30 feet from the north wall, is a bronze altar with many marine creatures sculpted in bas relief upon its sides. It is about four feet high and round, with a ten-foot diameter. Its top is concave, and a shal­ low basin apparently about two feet deep is filled with water. The bottom of the basin is filled with coins, a sprinkling of gems, and many small seashells. In the mouth of a 20 ' wide alcove south of the altar basin stands an idol or statue of serpentine stone, expertly sculpted to depict a writhing, amor­ phous agglomeration of fish, eels, octopi, and other marine monsters. This horrid thing is about eight feet high and nearly as broad, the whole forming a globular mass standing about four feet from the altar basin. The alcove to its rear is ten feet deep, the back wall of which is covered by a drapery appar­ ently fashioned from seaweed and water! Each corner of the hall is filled by a tri­ angular plinth, filling it and extending about 20 feet upwards. Atop each of these columns is a gargoyle-like statue made of bronze and coated with verdigris. The whole place radiates a dim magic and is pervaded with evil. In use, offerings are brought to the fountain and dipped in each basin, highest to lowest, before being placed on/in the altar. If this procedure is not fol­ lowed, the gargoyles on the plinths give chase (see below). The altar basin (B) is filled with salt water, of course. The treasure therein con­ sists of 42 cp, 37 sp, 60 ep, 51 gp, 23 pp, and 39 gems worth a total of 1, 920 gp (17 varied agates worth 10 gp each, 3 bloodstones and 6 zircons worth 50 gp each, and 4 ame­ thysts, 3 red garnets, and 6 tourmalines worth 100 gp each). If the altar is defiled or damaged, or if anything is removed from it, the guardian idol animates to pursue and punish the offenders (see below). If a sacrifice or donation is properly pre­ pared with the fountain (A) and placed in the altar basin, a magic mouth on the idol in the alcove makes a hooting noise, sumoning the occupants of area 214 to receive the worship­ pers. If the altar is improperly handled, the idol starts to roll slowly toward the offender, issuing forth hissing and hooting noises which likewise alert the occupants of area 214. In either case they appear in 2-5 rounds. The idol is actually a juggernaut (C). It can roll over victims (inflicting lOdlO points of damage) or reach out in any direction with eel heads, tentacles, pincers, and other attack forms to six foot range, doing so four times each round and inflicting 2-12 points of damage in each such attack. This thing is not able to turn sharply or reverse direc­ tions unless it first comes to a complete halt. For every ten feet it travels it can turn about three feet; it must travel 30 feet to make a 90 degree turn. It is also slow to start; in the first round of animation it can move but ten feet per round, but gains 1 • additional movement each round thereafter until its maximum 12 • rate is achieved. (For exam­ ple, in the ninth round of animation it moves at 9 "  rate.)

This garment gives the 64 wearer all the characteristics of a gargoyle, and even the mentality in this case; thus - Gargoyles (4): AC S, MV 9 "/15 ", HD 4 + 4, hp 28 each, #AT 4, D 1-3/1-3/1-6/1-4, SA + 1 bonus "to hit" and damage when first swooping to attack, SD hit only by + 1 or better magic weapons; XP 305 each (as if gargoyles) Note that the zombies may be Turned nor­ mally by a cleric. If one takes 20 or more points of damage from edged weapons or fire, consider the cloak destroyed. If the creatures are slain without damage to the cloaks, subsequent examination shows each to be a green-colored zombie. Any charac­ ter donning a gargoyle cloak is able to fly, attack, etc. as if a gargoyle, just as did the zombies. However, if a wearer keeps a cloak on for longer than one turn, apply a 10% chance per turn (cumulative) that the wearer gains the mind of a gargoyle as well, and either attacks or flies away (just as would a real gargoyle). Only death or a wish returns the victim to normal form. The seaweed wall to the south is merely a cleverly embroidered but normal drapery. It conceals another alcove 10' deep and 20' wide, with verdigris-covered bronze doors to the south and normal doors to the east and west. 214. LOUNGE Two under-priests are quartered here. They attack intruders, calling loudly to alert oth· ers in area 215 (and possibly areas 220-225). Each cleric wears cowled green robes with a gold circle on front and back, plate mail armor underneath, and carries a shield and two hammers.

Two upholstered armchairs and side tables are to the north. The center of the room is dominated by a long table with four chairs. Upon the table are green vessels - a decanter, six goblets, several bowls and plates, a basin, and a small box. A high desk stands against the west wall just south of the door; upon it are a few scraps of parchment and writing tools. A large wardrobe stands by a door in the south wall. The light is simply a form of continual light spell cast upon/in pieces of green but cheap quartz (each worth only 1 gp). The small box on the table holds 6 sug­ ared fruits which are coated with a narcotic substance. If even one is eaten, it causes great intoxication, and two or more cause a comatose condition (see Appendix C for more details). The decanter holds wine. The entire service fills two large sacks and is worth 2,00 gp if undamaged, being fash­ ioned from fine malachite. A secret compartment in the back of the high desk holds a scroll of three cleric spells: resist fire, neutralize poison, true seeing. The wardrobe holds several unremarkable garments and two green robes of watered silk, each with golden embroidery showing a squid-like creature with ten arms in a cir­ cle. The south door opens into a 10 ' wide, 30' long room. It contains a pair of beds separated by a folding screen. By each bed is a small stand, a bronze brazier, a low stool, and a locked chest. Each chest holds cloth­ ing, four texts on the Elemental Evil of Water (non-magical but worth 250 gp each, XP value 25 each), and a few treasures. The first chest holds a sack with 87 gp, a bronze mace (worth 15 gp), and a gold ring set with a rare green pearl (jewelry value 555 gp). The second chest has a n  old crumpled hand­ kerchief (containing 21 pp) and a potion of water breathing (2 doses). 215. SALON This is the residence of the canon Belsornig, chief cleric of the nearby Water Temple, a vile person filled with hubris and wicked- ness. He uses guile to dupe anyone, strikes whenever he has an advantage, and never admits anyone to be his better unless his life is at stake. He is set on becoming chief cleric of the whole Temple when it once more sets forth upon a course of open warfare against the land above. . Belsornig is working to subvert the humanoids of the Air Temple while threat­ ening their cleric(Kelno, in area 225) - not with harm from the Water Temple forces, but rather with the machinations of Alrrem and the Fire Temple. If captured and ques­ tioned, he reveals that a Greater Temple is two levels deeper, and guides adventurers to bring harm to its priests, as he sees an advantage therein. Of course, he bargains to have his own Water Temple spared, and never personally accompanies any expedi­ tion to the Greater Temple, except at swords' point. Belsornig is exceptional, having 15 Strength ( + 1 damage bonus), 18 Dexterity (-4 AC bonus and two-handed combat abil­ ity), and 16 Wisdom ( + 2 saving throw bonus vs. mind attacks, and spell bonuses included below). In a critical melee he can use a mace in his right hand and his rod of smiting(see below) in his left, thus attacking twice per round. He wears plate mail + 1 and a ring of Free action, but does not use a shield. If Belsornig hears fighting, he inves­ tigates carefully. If time permits, he places resist fire on himself before appearing, and may use prayer if his allies are engaged; he might prefer to silence an obviously danger­ ous spell caster. He knows, of course, that dispel magic can be quite useful against opponents obviously enjoying magical ben­ efits. If things look bad, he seeks shelter in the Water Temple (area 216). Rod of smiting: Note that this + 3 weapon (base damage ld8) inflicts 8-22 points of damage to a golem (including a juggernaut). It has 14 charges left. Any hit on a golem drains a charge, and a "to hit" roll of 20 drains a charge but produces triple damage (or destroys the golem or jugger­ naut target, using a total of two charges for the blow).

In his purse hanging from this belt are 21 gp and 14 pp, along with an iron key upon which the word "D'LYSS" is inscribed with runes. This word is the command to stop the juggernaut in area 213, and the key opens his personal chest. He wears a gold ring with a peridot bezel (jewelry value 1,00 gp). This place is swathed in rich green, even the ceiling being obscured by gossamer green hangings. Tapestries on the walls show scenes of undersea cruelty and death. A large bronze brazier stands in the middle of the floor, sending off curls of sweetish fishy-smelling smoke, flanked by hanging bronze lamps which shed a green glow throughout the room. Six plush armchairs are here, each with a matching footstool and low table. On each table is a small decanter, a bowl of nuts and fruits, and a stemmed cup of serpentine. In the center of the west wall is a couch of green velvet piled with pil­ lows. A round table before it holds an ivory tray, upon which are heaped many seashells. An armoire stands to each side of the west door. The ivory tray is worth 50 gp, but the sea­ shells have no value. Each decanter, bowl, and stemmed cup is worth 2 gp. The hang­ ing lamps contain cheap green quartz treated with continual light (worth 1 gp each for the gems, but each lamp worth 25 gp). The brass brazier is worth 30 gp. The northern armoire contains a suit of plate mail, a shield, a mace, and a green cloak. The southern one holds various non­ descript garments, plus a robe of watered green silk upon which a ten-armed octopoid creature, stitched in gold thread, writhes from back to front. Where the tentacles reach the breast is a gold circle set with 12 peridots - four small (each worth 100 gp), four medium-sized (each 500 gp), and four large (each 1,00 gp). A hook on one side of the cabinet interior supports a censer of bronze, coated with verdigris.

It holds two chairs flanking a table with 32 gold dishes upon it (worth 1,900 gp for all, total weight 800 gp). A desk stands near the table, and upon it are writing materials and a small tome. This volume deals with the secret rituals of Water Evil, but is of no value. A bookstand nearby holds six other similar works. At the south end of the chamber are a large bed, a small stand, and a locked bronze chest; a large mirror and a trident hang from the wall beside the bed. The lock of the chest contains a poisoned needle trap. Inside are items of normal clothing, a coral box (worth 100 gp) which contains 100 tiny seed pearls (worth 10 gp each), and a cloak of the manta ray. The tri­ dent is a magical trident of yearning; in its handle are a huge aquamarine (worth 5,000 gp) and a scroll of four cleric spells (purify food & drink, flame strike, part water, con­ trol weather). 216. THE POOL CHAMBER If any cleric or servant of the Water Temple has been questioned, the characters know that this is the Water Temple. Since this fac­ tion is now the strongest of the four, it is also known as the Lesser Temple. Note that fire spells of any sort do not function herein as long as the pool is alive (see below). Furthermore, no magic, evil, traps, et al. can be detected here; applicable spells seem to work, but detect nothing. The only exception is detect lie (see below). This large room is fashioned of great blocks of polished serpentine, save the domed ceiling of polished crystal - made to reflect everything in the room in a distorted way, concentrating light upon the center of the large oval pool of water in the center of the chamber. The whole place seems to be lit with a blue­ green light from this pool, and at the same time the pool seems to absorb light, capturing it in its heart. Pale green flames come from eight bronze cressets, four on the east wall and four west; the flames shed light but not heat. Tapestries of vilest sort cover the east and west sec­ tions of the north wall. The south wall shows a mosaic of some great ten-armed octopoid monster, holding a sacrificial victim in each tentacle. The monster is fashioned from dark purple tiles, with reddish highlights and green orbs. The pool is an oval, 20' across and 30 ' long, set in a basin of small lapis lazuli tiles. The crystal-clear water allows vision to the very bottom of the basin. The edge depth appears to be about four feet. The floor slopes steeply to the mid­ dle, to 12 foot depth, where some sort of humanoid is chained. You suddenly receive a telepathic message! The triton is pleading to be released, so that it can prevent your deaths when the kraken, shown on the wall, materializes and attacks. It will appear at any moment - so, as many as can, jump into the pool and help the triton break its chains I Soon it will be too late! If a detect lie is used while the thing is speak­ ing, it reveals both the lie and the EVIL of this thing. The pool itself is an intelligent evil crea­ ture from the Elemental Plane of Water. Its powerful, alien dweomer masks its alignment and intent. It speaks telepathically, lies most glibly, and is highly persuasive. The enchained figure is an illusion, produced by the creature (though disbelief has no effect). This creature's body is the clear silvery substance in the pool; though it seems to be water, it is actually a highly corrosive acid. A splash inflicts one point of damage, a dowsing 1-4 points, and immersion causes 5-20 points per round. If the thing cannot convince the whole party to jump in, it uses a suggestion (as the spell) each round on individual victims. (Once per week the crea­ ture can employ a limited wish to fulfill another creature's desire.) If a magic item enters the pool, it must be saved for (vs. acid) or be destroyed; a new saving throw must be made for each tum or fraction thereof. The monster feeds on energy (both of life and magic), and when it destroys a magic item, it gains any spell or spell-like powers of the item! It can produce these effects only during the four rounds immediately after such an item's destruc­ tion, but can do so in addition to its normal suggestion attacks. The thing has 100 hp, but cannot be dam­ aged by blows or most spells. Only the fol­ lowing things can affect it: cone of cold holy water (1 vial) ice storm Paralysis 2-5 rounds Damage, 1-4 points Paralysis 1-4 rounds 66 lower water otiluke's frezing sphere part water purify food & drink purify water water, 1 gallon Damage, 4-32 points Paralysis 5-8 rounds Damage, 3-18 points Damage, 5-40 points Damage, 10-60 points Damage, 1 point If the pool creature is slain (XP 8950), the crystal dome shatters, inflicting 1-12 points of damage to each creature in the room (no saving throw). The lapis lazuli basin shat· ters at the same time. If more than four turns are spent searching through the remains of the shattered basin, 1-8 pieces of value are found each tum thereafter, to a maximum of four turns (i.e. 4-32 pieces in all; base value 1,000 gp each, maximum 5,000 gp each. Count each piece found as 100 gp weight, 500 gp volume. If the crystals from the dome are exam· ined, a coral scrollcase (worth 50 gp, previ· ously hidden behind the dome) is found. It contains a parchment with the following message: On three, in six, lies nine - but none shall ever see Vile Good cloaked by Fair Evil for eternity. Will you answer, Answerer? Where is your power, pray? With the whelp of Mitrik and there until doomsday. 217. TRIANGULAR CHAMBER An owlbear is kept chained here to guard against unwelcome visitors - especially agents of the Fire Temple. As soon as any creature steps into the area, the owlbear begins hissing, clacking its beak, and sound· ing its strange hooting roars. The noise draws the keeper from area 218 to investi· gate. The owlbear attacks fiercely, barring any passage through its chamber, until slain or forced back by its keeper. (This monster is not well-fed.) Owlbear: AC 5, MV 12 n ,  HD 5 + 2, hp 38, #AT 3, D 1-6/1-6/2-12, SA "to hit" roll of 18 or more on claw attack means hug for additional 2-16 damage; XP 529 This area was once of some importance, for its walls are plastered and painted, and evidence of carpeting can be seen in 0NGiITAL ADVEITTV'S REiITCAR..IlATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EilTAL EVIL the comers, though such is now a ruin. The floor is covered with litter, filth, bones, and possibly much more. The walls are dirty and stained, with great chunks of plaster pulled off and gouge marks everwhere else below ten foot height. The room stinks. An eight-foot­ long chain is bolted to the center of the floor. A thorough search of the mess produces 3- 30 each of gp, ep, sp, and cp. 218. ABANDONED SlDREROOM This room is the lair of the owlbear's "keeper" (tormentor), a troll. It goes to area 217 upon hearing noises of intruders, after first grabbing its 12 ' long fauchard-fork. If intruders are led by anyone wearing the green robes of the Water Temple (or if the entire group is so garbed, of course), the troll shoves the owlbear to the northwest comer and allows passage - making sure, afterwards, that they report to room 222, either accompanying or following them. If intruders do not identify themselves, or if any wear robes of the Fire Temple, the troll looses the owlbear and attacks itself, using the pole arm at long range (and gaining a + 2 Strength bonus to damage, included below) but shifting to the usual claw-claw­ bite routine for closer melee if necessary. This troll is on fairly good terms with its counterpart in area 203, as well as with its fellows in area 219. Troll: AC 4, MV 12 ", HD 6 + 6, hp 40, #AT 3, D 5-8/5-8/2-12, SA fauchard-fork (range 12 ' ,  D 3-10), SD regenerates (3 hp per round starting 3 rounds after being damaged); XP 845 This 20' x 30 ' chamber is a mess in every respect. It reeks of troll, is covered with dirt and rubbish, and is littered with bits of decaying meat and many bones, strewn haphazardly about the place. Some shelves remain on the walls, and a few boxes, crates, barrels, and bales are intact, still standing along the walls where they were placed - who knows how many years ago! There is nothing of value in the place. If the intact containers are searched, one barrel is found to contain drinkable wine. A sack of mouldering grain in the northeast comer also contains a hidden leather sack, with 48 pp, 84 gp, and 109 ep. 219. ROOM OF BONES This is the quarters of a troll chief named Oohlgrist, an honored guest of the two trolls nearby (in areas 203 and 218), who serve opposing factions of the Temple. Each seeks to win Oohlgrist's favor, for he can bring a score or more of great trolls to align with the one preferred. This room was espe­ cially decorated for him, and he is brought choice victims for dinners. Though evil and cruel, Oohlgrist is wily and cunning. He has no intention of risking himself or his fol­ lowers unnecessarily. He intends to milk the rivalry to the utmost, then joining neither side unless certain that those involved can triumph without any great struggle involv­ ing him or his trolls. Something has taken considerable pains to decorate this disused storeroom. The walls are covered with a plastering of excrement and bones, to form both pat­ terns and shelf-like bone ledges. Skulls leer from these shelves - human, humanoid, dwarven, and various sorts of other creatures as well. The floor is a conglomerate of bones and ordure. A large armchair and crude table of sorts, each fashioned from bones, stand in the northwest comer. In the southeast cor­ ner is a heap of torn cloth, leather scraps, bits of tapestries, and pieces of rugs. Suddenly the pile moves, and something rises - a huge troll! Troll chief: AC 2, MV 9 ", HD 6 + 6, hp 50, #AT 3, D 6-9/6-9/4-14, SA attacks as if 10 HD, SD regenerates (3 hp per round starting 3 rounds after being damaged), wears ring of fire resistance; XP 1050 Oohlgrist wears bone armor (worth a gem in trade with a troll or ogre) for a -2 AC bonus (included above). He also wears a ring of fire resistance on the little finger of his left hand, a necklace of gold with four small rubies given to him by the priests of the Fire Temple (jewelry value 4,750 gp), and a jeweled belt given him by the priests of the Water Temple (silver with four nice emeralds, jewelry value 5,250 gp). In a pouch at his belt is a necklace of adaptation, 67 also a gift from the Water Temple followers. (DM, be sure that you make saving throws for these items if Oohlgrist is attacked by magical means which could damage them.) A potion of extra healing is concealed in a small leather pouch under the pile of old cloth. If confronted by a party demonstrably capable of killing him (and thus obviously a fair match for the various Temple factions), he tries to parley. (Of course he'd rather eat humans than talk with them, but.. . .  ) Being a tribal leader, Oohlgrist knows rudimen­ tary Common. His first offer is to spare the characters' lives if they pay ransom of gems or many precious coins. Failing that, he sim­ ply tells them to "go away, and Great Ugly Troll Chief spare you"; he has other things to do, and isn't hungry. If that ploy fails, he offers his ruby necklace, and then his belt of emeralds (but never any of his magic items). Last, he volunteers (so to speak) to aid the party in overcoming one of the Elemental Temples, and will settle for as little as one­ quarter of the loot gained thereby (but first asks for half). Oohlgrist actually fights well if he perceives no treachery, and if the char­ acters fight as well. If they try to betray him, or expect him to bear the brunt of the fight­ ing, he immediately switches sides. Oohl­ grist will not cooperate for any extended period of time. If the characters are weak­ ened, he turns on them. 220. SIDE ROOM Four bugbear guards are stationed here, in service to the Water Temple. If they hear fighting in the area, they rush out to see what's happening, arriving in only 1 round. Each wears a green vest-like shirt over armor. Each carries 3-12 gp, 3-12 ep, 3-12 sp, and 3-12 cp.

Four heaps of material, evidently used as sleeping mats, are evenly spaced on the floor. A long bench stands by the east 0IUGiIIAL A.DVEIITVɇS REiIICAR.IIATED • THE TEllrPLE 0F ELEllrEllTA.L EVIL _ ______ ...;ɽ--------..;_------------------------------' wall, under which is a small keg. A large barrel stands near the north door, with a lumpy sack nearby. Several green cloaks hang from wall pegs. The small keg contains wine of average quality; the large barrel holds water. The sack contains some bad-smelling meat, a large wheel of cheese, and several loaves of coarse black bread. Under one of the cloaks hangs a battle axe. 221. INNER CHAMBER The overseer of the guards of the Water Temple is an ogre, who lives here. He is lazy and rather stupid, and comes only if sum­ moned; but due to his horrible temper, the bugbears hate to summon him. He wears a padded jack sewn with seashells, and uses a green drape as a cape. He wears his hair in a topnot held in place by three silver pins, each set a with pearl (each worth 110 gp). Ogre: AC 3, MV 9", HD 4 + 1, hp 29, #AT 1, D 9-18 (3d4 + 6, with huge trident); XP 235 This room is much like the one to the south. A pair of beds are shoved together, with a heavy chest beside them. A large table and chair are the only other furnishings. Three barrels stand along the south wall. The chest is secured with a large padlock, which can be broken by four blows from a mace or hammer. Inside are various items of apparel, a brass candlestick (worth 1 ep), a rusted saw, 419 cp, 282 sp, 23 ep, 133 gp, and 4pp. 222. ROOM, 20' x 20' Four bugbears are quartered here, as part of the guard of the Water Temple. They cannot hear fighting elsewhere, and must be sum­ moned to leave this area. Each wears a sleeveless overshirt of green and carries 4-16 cp, 4-16 ep, and 4-16 gp. Their chieftain is quartered in the small room (10 ' square) immediately to the north, and carries 6 ep, 16 gp, 10 pp, and 4 hematites worth 10 gp each. The bugbear chieftain is secretly treating with the bugbears who serve the Air Temple (those in areas 223-226) because he and his fellows know of the offer regarding the trolls (203 and 218-219), and plan to defect en masse to the Air Temple if the Water Tem­ ple should win the service of the troll chief­ tain. If he sees a party in the company of a troll, he executes his defection plan. (Natu­ rally, the whole thing is encouraged by Kelno - area 225 - who is promising more pay, more food, and less work.) If adventurers attempt to parley with the bugbears, the chieftain will most certainly defect from the Water Temple forces if offered sufficient reward - coins, coins, other treasure, spared lives. . . .  All of the bugbears know of the secret door in the pas­ sage to the west, and reveals it if given suf­ ficient reason to do so. Bugbear guards (4): AC S, MV 9", HD 3 + 1, hp 18, 15, 13, 9, #AT 1, D 2-8 (glaive­ guisarme), SA surprise on 1-3; XP 207, 195, 187, 171 Bugbear chieftain: AC 4, MV 9", HD 4, hp 25, #AT 1, D 2-8 (morning star), SA + 1 bonus "to hit" and damage, surprise on 1-3; XP 235 222a. STAIRWAY An unlocked normal door here leads to a smal landing, from which descends a dusty stairway leading directly to area 3U (Dungeon Level Thre), a dangerous area. Review that area description before you continue. 223. JUMBLED ROOM This 20' x 30' chamber contains many odds and ends of furniture - thre wooden chairs, two armchairs, a large table, two small tables, a desk, thre couches, a cot, and countles cushions and pillows. Six bugbears herein have accumulated these "treasures". If attacked, they tip over the tables to form a barricade, gaining a -2 AC bonus vs. missiles or -1 AC bonus in melee. Each is clad in gray kilt and cloak, the latter with a large black square sewn upon it to indicate the personal ret­ inue of the Air Temple. Each has a pair of spears to throw before melee; each carries 1-4 pp and 2-8 gp. If attacked from the west, they alert the ocupants of area 224. They wil readily receive the bugbears from the Water Temple, of course, if these cowards indicate their wilingnes to switch sides. Bugbears (6): AC 5, MV 9 ", HD 3 + 1, hp 19, 16, 14, 13, 13, 12, #AT 1, D 1-8 (bat- 68 tie axe), SA 2 spears each (D 1-6, ranges 1 •12 • /3 "), surprise on 1-3; XP 211, 199, 191, 187, 187, 183 Old wall hangings of gray, ivory, and white cover the north and south walls. The east and west walls are plastered and painted with murals showing the evil of Elemental Air. The four torch brackets are empty. A small barrel is near the east door, and a large cask by the west. The small barrel contains beer, the larger, water. In the lining of one of the upholstered chairs is a ring, lost there long ago (jewelry value 700 gp). 224. ROOM 20' x 20' Four bugbears, the personal guards of the cleric Kelno (area 225), are on duty here. Each wears a scale mail jack, gray kilt and cape, and has 1-6 pp, 1-6gp, 1-6 ep, and 1-6 sp. Each is armed with bardiche and mace, the latter to be hurled at foes before melee. They are accompanied by two gnolls who also wear gray kilts and capes, but over chain mail jacks. These creatures are tolerated well due to (a) Kelno's demand that they be accepted, (b) their own toughnes, and (c) their fast and accurate use of longbows. Each has 18 arrows and a longbow, to be used while trying to avoid close combat. Each carries 3-U gp, 3-U ep, and 3-U sp. Bugbears (4): AC 4, MV 9", HD 3 + 1, hp 20, 17, 15, 11, #AT 1, D 2-8 (bardiche), SA 1 mace each for hurling (D 2-7, range o• 11•1 2 "), surprise on 1-3; XP 215, 203, 195, 179 Gnolls (2): AC 4, MV 9 ", HD 2, hp 16, 14, #AT 1 or 2, D 1-8 (battle axe) or 1-6/1-6 (longbow); XP 68, 64 This plastered, painted chamber was probably one of the many guest rooms of the Temple. It now holds a cot, two sofas, some cushions, a small table, and a battered cabinet. The carpeting on the floor is of a gray hue, indicating connec­ tion to the Air Temple. Inside the cabinet are some old clothes, five wax candles, a quart of honey, and a hand axe. The small room to the south, quarters of the gnolls, has nothing in it but two piles of old tapestries and rags (bedding) and four spears standing in a far corner. 0RjGiilAL ADVEil'fV'S REi ilCAR_IlA'fED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEllTAL EVI L 225. GRIM CHAMBER This is the residence of Kelno, the only cleric of the Air Temple-his apprentices having been slain by rival factions. He is bit­ ter and full of great hatred for both the Fire and Water Temples. Kelno bargains with anyone if he sees profit for himself and harm to these rivals. He has spent all his funds on hiring and bribing bugbears, for he hopes to amass a sufficient force to tum the tables on the other Temples. Kelno wears chain mail + 1 and a cloak of protection + 1 (which affects only his sav­ ing throws, when worn with magical armor), and wields a mace + 1. Though he carries a dagger of venom with one dose of virulent poison (-2 penalty to victim's sav­ ing throw), he is saving it for either Alrrem (room 205c) or Belsomig (room 215). His Strength is 15 ( + 1 damage bonus) and Dex­ terity 17 (-3 AC bonus). (All bonuses are included in the following statistics.) If hard pressed, he uses his darknes 15 ' radius spell to escape into the concealed passage to the east (area 209a), trying to reach corridor 209. If enemies are in pursuit, he flees down the staircase to the lower dungeon level, for he knows portions of that area fairly well. Kelno the Prefect: AC 1 (chain mail + 1), MV 12 w, Level 5 Cleric, hp 32, #AT 1, D 4-9 (mace + 1), SA spells, SD cloak + l; XP 520 First level: command, cure light wounds, protection from good, purify food & drink, sanctuary Second level: hold person, know alignment, resist fire (x2), silence 15 ' radius Third level: cause blindness The entire room is gray-carpeting, plaster, wall hangings, furnishings, etc.-and spartan. Lamps of grayish metal on a small table and a wall shelf dimly light the room; a pair of uphol­ stered chairs are by the table. On the table are some pewter dishes and a plain crock half-filled with mead. The shelves hold some foodstuffs, a few scrolls and books, and several human and demi­ human skulls. A narrow bed is in the northeast comer, with a small stand beside it. The scrolls and books are of no value. The wardrobe holds worthless garments and a cassock of silver cloth, the latter worked with crystal beads and jet to form black squares with shining centers. This is the ceremonial robe of the high cleric of the Air Temple, worth 1,500 gp. A drapery conceals the exit to the east. In that passage is a flowing fountain, set into the wall, and the passage beyond is piled with arms and armor: 1 1  suits of armor (bugbear size, worth 50 gp each to bugbears) 4 battle axes 2 fauchard-forks 4 glaive-guisarmes 7 maces (heavy) 8 morning stars 5 quivers (20 arrows each) 16 spears (heavy) 1 sword, bastard Near this pile is a locked chest, trapped with a poison needle. Inside are only 11 gp, 28 ep, and 176 sp. 226. KITCHEN Six bugbears are staying here, new recruits of the Air Temple. Kelno (225) has them stay here in the kitchen where he feeds his troops, and harrangues them about overthrowing the enemies of Elemental Air Evil so his rivals won't learn about his added forces. If sum­ moned, the bugbears gladly fight with their fellows against any opponents. Each has ben given a gray cloak and 20 gp; each also has 1-6 ep, 1-6 sp, and 1-6 cp. Here also are four goblins, kept as ser­ vants. They are quasi-slaves, though their masters have promised them a small share of the expected spoils, good fun torturing prisoners, and even a place in the fighting forces of the Air Temple. Each goblin has only 2-5 cp. Bugbears (6): AC 5, MV 9 #, HD 3 + 1, hp 17, 14, 13, 13, 11, 10, #AT 1, D 1-8 (bat­ tle axe), SA surprise on 1-3; XP 203, 191, 187, 187, 179, 175 Goblins (4): AC 6, MV 6 #, HD 1-1, hp 6, 5, 4, 3, #AT 1, D 1-6 (shortsword); XP 16, 15, 14, 13 This place is dirty and full of litter, but has been used of late. Ashes are in both fireplaces on the west wall. The long trestles which run down the center of the room are filled with earthenware dishes 69 and food scraps. Four barrels stand along the south wall. Some large black­ ish sausages are strung over the ceiling arches. Heaps of old rags and skins are piled helter-skelter in all the comers; this place is apparently used as a camp as well as a mess hall. The pantry area to the northeast like­ wise shows evidence of use. The shelves are filled with unappetizing foodstuffs, plus sacks of millet, beets, and meal. Two barrels contain water, one beer, and one wine. No treasure is here other than that carried by the inhabitants. 227. HALL OF TRIUMPHAL EVIL This huge, echoing hall was evidently once the scene of great revels celebrating the triumphs of the Temple. The floor of the place is littered with skeletons, skulls, and bones of humans and various humanoids. Here and there are parts of broken chairs, stools, tables, benches, sideboards, buffets, cabinets, and cases. Much of the wreckage has probably been carted off for firewood. Tapestries and trophies still remain on the walls in spots. The former show scenes of raid­ ing, looting, pillate, and rapine; trophies include mummified heads, torn battle standards, hides and skins, battered shields, sundered armor, and a broken broadsword. Dozens of empty cressets and sconces line the walls. The broad steps in the middle of the north wall are of dull black stone, and the descending stair seems most depressing and horrible-though passable. Nothing here has any notable value. The runes of the permanent antipathy effect (found on the main Temple entrance, area 210, et al.) are here scribed on the steps, 20 feet from the corridor. No creature of evil alignment can even enter this stairway; no one having failed a previous saving throw against this effect can descend the stair more than ten feet. Anyone succeeding at all pre­ vious saving throws against like dweomers must again save here (and again with a -2 penalty) or be blocked. Furthermore, the same effect is placed on a pair of huge bronze doors at the base of this staircase (area 340), which are triple-chained and triple-barred with cold iron. 0RjGiilAL ADVEilTVRJ:S REiilCAR_IlATED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEilTAL EVIL 227a.

PRISON ROOM The gaoler, an ogre, is dozing on his bedding in the southeast comer of this area. He needs one round to awaken and rise for a fight. His assistant, a bugbear, is sitting at a table along the diagonal wall (to the northeast), drinking ber to wash down his recent repast. Neither of these humanoids is aligned with any Elemental Temple; their orders come "from below", and are delivered by an ettin. The leaders of the various Temples know this and are afraid to violate the neu­ trality of the place. Each Elemental Temple has a cell here to hold prisoners; that of the Earth (southwest) and Air (northwest) are empty. The cells of the Water Temple (A) and Fire Temple (B) hold prisoners. The bugbear wears a chain mail shirt, and has a purse with 3 pp, 4 gp, and 18 sp. A "large dagger" at his belt is a shortsword + 1, but he uses a flail in combat. The ogre is unarmored and uses a club (gaining a + 6 damage bonus, due to Strength). He carries 39 gp and 28 ep in his purse, along with the keys to the cells. Bugbear: AC 3, MV 9 *, HD 3 + l, hp 20, #AT 1, D 2-7 (flail), SA surprise on 1-3; XP 215 Ogre: AC 4, MV 9 *, HD 4 + 1, hp 19, #AT 1, D 7-12 (club); XP 185 An outsided table and two matching chairs stand in the northeast, along the diagonal wall. A cask and several leather jacks are on the table, amongst small hunks of cheese and dried meat; some food scraps have fallen to the floor. Nearby is a barrel and a huge pot. Brack­ ets and torches line the walls, but only 3 contain torches, none lit. A great pile of hides and skins is in the southeast comer-a bed of sorts. Four bronze-bound oaken doors, each with a heavy bar, padlock, and small barred port, mark the cells. The cask contains ber; the barrel. water, and the pot, some sort of gruel of grain and veg­ etables. One skin in the ogre's bed-pile is a giant weasel pelt, worn and tom, worth 1,200 gp. Each cell is about eight feet square; se below for prisoner descriptions (cells 228a and 228b). The prisoners of the Water Tem­ ple are planned for sacrifices to conjure up a major demon, with which they may over­ come all of the other Elemental Temples once and for all. The prisoners of the Fire Temple are slated for death to gain the pro­ tection of a powerful efreeti, who may aid them against the Water Temple. Both groups will be very displeased (to say the least) if their captive sacrifices are freed. 228a. CELL Of THE WATER TEMPLE This cell holds four elves. If freed, they ask to be shown the route out so they can immediately return to their homeland, but express great gratitude and promise rewards for their rescuers. Two elves are normal, but two are Noble-Countess Trillahi of Celene and her consort, Sir Juffer.

If the wearer becomes evil or purposely harms any unicorn, the ring drops off unnoticed and is forever lost. All gifts are directed to individuals, and cannot be redistributed. 228b. CELL Of THE FIRE TEMPLE This cell holds three human males. One is a brigand (HD 2, AL N) who was caught 70 taking several gems and deserting, and so has been beaten and imprisoned to await sacrifice. He gladly joins adventurers in any endeavors that allow him to kill servants of the Fire Temple and bring him loot. The other two prisoners are merchants (Level 0 non-combatants) from the Nulb area.

The littered mess on the floor shows that there has been some fairly recent traffic, probably to carry off any remaining foodstuffs. 230. GARBAGE ROOM This plastered and painted chamber, probably a secluded place for relaxation when the Temple was in its heyday, is now filled with rubbish. The room is a heap of rotting, stinking garbage, offal, dung, and who knows what else; bones and skulls are visible here and there. Part of a bronze-bound coffer of some sort can be seen near the middle of a large pile of refuse in the center of the room. An otyugh lurks here, because the eating is good (with occasional fresh appetizers, when wandering creatures become too curi­ ous). It awaits at the center of the large cen­ tral pile, and attacks if anyone goes beyond four feet of the entrance. Otyugh: AC 3, MV 6n, HD 6, hp 32, #AT 3, D 1-8/1-8/2-5, SA disease, SD never sur­ prised; XP 956 The bugbears to the north (area 231-233) know of this monster and avoid it, having already lost one of their number to its appe­ tite. Being a good garbage disposal as well, they do not wish to kill it. The coffer contains a scroll of seven magic-user spells: friends, magic missile, knock, mirror image, web, slow, rary's mnemonic enhancer. Under the central "nest" of the otyugh is a gold platter (worth 300 gp), 10-40 of each coin type (cp, sp, ep, gp, pp), and a platinum bracelet (worth 1,00 gp) set with four opals (each worth 1,000 gp). 0RjGiilAL ADVEil'f'VRJSS REiilCAR_IlA'f'ED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEilTAL EVIL 231. ROOM OF THE ELEMENTS Four bugbears are on guard here. At the time of the party's approach, one may (60% chance) be watching through a small port in the north door. Assuming that the party is approaching by way of the outer corridor, the bugbears then cannot be surprised; if the party continues west, the guards alert those in area 232. Each bugbear wears black armor, indicating that they are in service to the overall Temple (aloof from the individ­ ual Elemental factions and, therefore, the other bugbears in this dungeon level). Each carries a spear, to be hurled before melee, and each has 2-12 gp, 2-12 ep, and 2-12 sp. Bugbears (4): AC 5, MV 9 n, HD 3 + 1, hp 13, 12, 11, 11, #AT 1, D 1-8 (battle axe), SA 1 spear each (D 1-6, ranges l "1z n I 3 n), surprise on 1-3; XP 187, 183, 179, 179 The walls of this small room are covered with scenes showing all four principles of Elemental Evil in their most horrible and disgusting forms. Some battered and tom furnishings also indicate that this place was probably once a sitting room or lounge for some high Temple official. The wall sconces are of bronze, as is the wall basin set in a hemispherical alcove in the east wall. A small table, two chairs, a couch, and a broken cabinet are also in the room. 232. SALON Seven bugbears, males in service to the overall Temple (and thus clad in black) are quartered here. With them are six females, who do not fight unless the males are obvi­ ously in trouble. All 13 bugbears will lay an ambush if alerted by the guards in area 231, and will summon those in 233 to help. Bugbears (7 male): AC 5, MV 9 ", HD 3 + 1, hp 19, 16, 15, 15, 13, 12, 9, #AT l, D 2-7 (flail), SA surprise on 1-3; XP 211, 199, 195, 195, 187, 183, 171 Bugbears (6 female): AC 6, MV 9", HD 2, hp 13, 10, 9, 8, 8, 8, #AT 1, D 2-8 (morn­ ing star); XP 70, 64, 62, 60 (ƕ3) Each male has 2-12 gp, 2-12 ep, and 2-12 sp. Each female has 1-6 ep and 2-12 sp. This 30' x 40' room was once quite splen­ did, if its wall hangings, carpet remnants, and battered furnishings are any gauge. Cresets and sconces of bronze line the walls. Four small tables, six chairs, two couches, and two sideboards are here, as well as several boxes and chests. A large iron pot hangs from a bronze chain in the middle of the room (suspended from the place some filagreed lamp once hung) over a charcoal fire in a bronze bowl, its original purpose unknown. The boxes and chests hold only old cloth­ ing, food, and junk. The iron pot contains a stew of questionable composition. The door to the south leads into a 10' x 20' room which is filled with various poor but edible foodstuffs, some meats and cheeses, and barrels of grain, flour, biscuits, beer, vinegar, wine, and salt. 233. SIDE CHAMBER The leader of the bugbears and his lieu­ tenant occupy this room with three females (who are comely, as bugbears go- though they do not go far in that direction). All are clad in black. The leader and lieutenant are unusually strong, gaining damage bonuses of + 2 and + 1 (respectively) with any held or hurled weapon; each carries a spear in battle, to be hurled before engaging with other weapons. The females are aggressive, and fight with the males. The largest male wears a gold chain from which depends a golden skull emblem (jew­ elry value 175 gp), and carries a pouch con­ taining 23 gp, 15 pp, and 6 bits of turquoise (each worth 10 gp). The lieutenant carries 3 pp, 14 gp, 5 ep, and 19 sp. Each female has 1-6 gp, 1-6 ep, 1-6 sp, and 1-6 cp, and the largest also wears a silver earring with a mounted jasper gem (worth 100 gp).

The walls are plastered and bear murals, albeit the plaster is now broken and stained and most of the painting is ruined. Rugs are still on the floor, and a huge bed stands in the southwest corner. Another heap of bedding and pillows occupies the northwest comer. A cabinet stands beside the bed, along with a small table, a large wardrobe, and a brazier. Two lamps hang from ceiling chains, and four sconces adorn the walls. The wardrobe is stuffed with old cloth­ ing, some tapestries (one of which is worth 350 gp), a sack of food, 5 bottles of wine, and miscellaneous junk. 234. S10RAGE CHAMBER A su-monster lairs here, living amidst the stone flying buttresses supporting the roof of this large room. It is near the south end, and swings down to attack anyone who comes within ten feet of the south wall. It is a huge old male which recently migrated to this level from that below, having escaped its captors who kept it chained as a guard beast. Its last kill was a goblin, before that a bugbear, and its first was a half-ore; only their unbroken skulls remain to tell the tale. The su-monster has gone hungry for some time now, as the Temple servants enter in groups and with their weapons pointed upwards. The creature has no treasure. Su-monster: AC 6, MV 9", HD 5 + 5, hp 41, #AT 5, D 1-4 (x4)/2-8, SA psionics; XP 471 This oddly shaped chamber is crammed with containers of all sorts-large clay jars, boxes, barrels, crates, chests, sacks, casks, bales, bags, hampers, and others. Some are obviously broken or empty, but many seem full. Bales contain black cloth and some finished garments (cloaks, capes, kilts, etc.). Scores of arrows, quarrels, javelins, spears, and several dozen hand weapons are in the 10' x 30 ' alcove to the northeast. At the south end of the place are boxes and sev­ eral huge pottery jars, but near them are three humanoid skulls and a few bones. 0RjGiIIAL ADVEIITVJU;S REiIICARJIATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEllTAL EVIL The alcove contains nothing magical. The many containers hold basic foodstuffs­ meal, grain, flour, salt, dried and salted meats, sausages, cheese, biscuits, nuts, dried fruit, wine, ale, beer, and others. 235. ROOM, 20' x 20' The door to this chamber is broken, sun­ dered from its hinges and lying in pieces on the floor. The room beyond is a shambles-several parts of skeletons, broken furniture, and charred cloth and wood. Shredded wall coverings also show signs of fire. Nothing here is hidden or of value. 236. CISTERN CHAMBER This oddly shaped chamber is bisected by a curving wall of well-dressed, mor­ tared stones. The wall is about four feet tall, and to the south side of it is water, high enough to almost flow over the top. Water trickles in from several places along the east, south, and west walls; overflow gravitates to floor drains even as you watch. Careful examination of the walls and floor within the cistern discovers that the stones are covered with some form of algae, apparently quite slimy and presumably slip­ pery. The floor of the cistern immediately south of the retaining wall is four feet lower than that in the room, and slopes down to the south about two feet for every five; thus, at the far south end, the cistern is about 15 feet deep. The overflow drains carry the water to the dungeon level below. Anyone trying to stand on the slippery cistern floor slips on the slimy growth (no saving throw) and slides to the lowest part of the cistern, drowning in 3-5 rounds unless rescued or light enough to float. In that deepest portion is a large round slime­ covered object, which is a shield + 2. 237. S10RAGE CHAMBER This place evidently once held many sorts of supplies; much of the foodstuffs are now scattered and ruined, rotting on the floor. Broken containers are tossed about, mixed with many bones. Nothing here is hidden or of value. 238. PADLOCKED DOOR This heavy oaken door is secured by a large padlock, apparently used with some frequency as it seems well-oiled. The lock can be picked or broken open, the latter requiring 30 points of damage. The room is 20' square. Several large hampers stand along the south wall. Propped along the other walls and scat­ tered around the floor are eight shields and many human-sized suits of armor- 3 plate, 2 banded, 1 splinted, 6 chain, 3 scale, and 1 of ring mail. Nothing here is magical. All the items herein have ben taken from various intruders and dungeon adventurers; some pieces are found to bear familiar smithy marks, personal identification labels (of victims now deceased and missing from their abodes in towns near and far), and other signs of previous care. All items are in fair to good condition. In the ham­ pers are the following: 1 suit chain mail armor, halfling­ sized (worth 60 gp) 1 suit plate mail armor, dwarf-sized (worth 350 gp) 8 backpacks (leather) 14 holy water vials, full 2 lanterns, bullseye 3 lanterns, hooded 1 set lockpicks 2 mallets (wood) 2 mapcases (leather) 1 mirror, silver 4 mirrors, steel 17 parchment sheets 6 pouches, small 5 pouches, large 4 ropes (each a 50' coil) 5 sacks, small 2 sacks, large 52 spikes (iron) 6 tinderboxes 239. S10REROOM This large chamber is evidently used for storing wood and lumber. Stacks of fire­ wood stand near the entrance, planks and beams at the west end. Just inside the entry are several large lumpy sacks. 72 The wood is fairly new, and this place is in regular use. The sacks are filled with charcoal. 240. JUNK ROOM Entry into this room is seen by a guard in area 241 (q.v.), who is watching through a slight tear in the hanging on the south wall. This place is filled with old furniture, mostly wardrobes, cabinets, armoires, and chests. Two chairs, a stool, a small table, and a couch are in the southeast comer. A shabby carpet is on the floor, and various types of hangings adorn the walls. The place is a hodgepodge of junk, obviously altered since the overthrow of the Temple. Examination of the various chests, ward­ robes, etc. reveals all sorts of clothing­ merchants' garments, laborers' clothing, farmers' and seafarers' garb, scribes' robes, womens' apparel, and even beggars' ragged wear; hats, cloaks, capes, robes, sandals, boots, shoes, and others. It seems as if some madman has made an effort to collect cloth­ ing of all sorts and types, from the poorest sort to the finery of a noble or court fop. If care is taken in sorting, adventurers can fill three large sacks with good garments, worth 500 gp per sack. A full tum of sorting is needed to fill each sack. 241. SIDE CHAMBER A slightly torn hanging on the south wall of area 240 conceals a door, which is pierced by a small window closed with an iron shut­ ter. The door has no handle on the north side, and is barred from the south. Behind this door, watching the junk room from his position on a stool, is a guard. While observing the junk room through a tear in the hanging, he keeps a firm grip on a piece of twine, strung between his position and that of two other guards currently resting in the inner chamber (to the immediate west, 10' x 20 ' ) .  The 10 ' square cubicle of the watcher's position is separated from the inner chamber by a large heavy drape. If the watcher sees intruders, he pulls the twine, which causes a billet of wood to thump and alert them, its noise dampened by the drape between the areas. If anyone approaches the concealed entrance, the guard fires a light crossbow through the 0NGiII.A.L ADVEII'f'V'S REiIIC.A.RJI.A.'tED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEfiTAL EVI L window (gaining a + 4 bonus to hit), slams the shutter closed, and retreats to the inner room. All three guards then prepare to fire crossbows at intruders breaking through the concealed door-but only after alerting the other guards in area 242. A knock spell opens the bar and the door easily, but the portal otherwise takes SO points of damage before collapsing. Each guard wears chain mail armor and shield, and carries a longsword as well as a light crossbow with 30 bolts. Each has 2-8 gp. If captured and questioned, the guards admit to being part of a raiding force which scouts for the Temple and generally supplies it, brings captives, and recruits others (both human and humanoid) to serve. Guards (3): AC 4 (chain & shield), MV 9 N, Level 0, hp 6, 5, 4, #AT 1, D 1-8 (long­ sword) or 2-5 (light crossbow), XP 20, 19, 18 The guardpost contains only a stool. In the area west of the drape are two chairs and a table, a barrel with 48 extra crossbow bolts, and a cask of water. Two torches burn in wall sconces, and a hooded lantern on the table is lit. Beside the lantern are three mugs and a jug of wine. 242. CROOKED CORRIDOR This area is a cramped barracks for 20 guards, quarters of those in area 241. Four are herein, with their leader, a swordsman (Level 3 Fighter); the others are out on a raiding expedition. All are clad in black. Each guardsman carries 2-8 gp; the leader wears a gold chain (worth 150 gp) set with a large jet gem (worth 100 gp), and carries 27 gp in a belt pouch. If combat goes badly, the leader pulls a torch on the south wall (which opens a secret door to area 243) and get help from the bandits therein while stepping out of the fray himself. As he is rather arrogant, feel­ ing his abilities to be equal to nearly any test, he does not get the bandits unless invaders are obviously winning. The guards and their leader all wear chain mail armor and carry shields. The leader gains a -3 AC bonus due to his 17 Dexterity, and a + 1 damage bonus (Strength 15), but does not normally use a shield. Guards (4): AC 4 (chain & shield), MV 9 ", Level 0, hp 7, 5, S, 4, #AT 1, D 1-8 (long- sword); XP 17, 15, 15, 14 Leader: AC 2 (chain mail), MV 9*, Level 3 Fighter, hp 19, #AT 1, D 3-9 (bastard sword); XP 92 This passage is lined with double bunks, ten in all. Each has a straw mattress, and two small boxes are tucked underneath, head and foot. Three torches are mounted in wall sconces, but only one, on the south wall, is lit. A not-very-secret door is in the west wall at the bend in the corridor. Above it, positioned horizontally, is a large beam, studded with sharp spikes. It seems to be fastened to a hinge at the west end, and supported by a cord at the east, which connects to a fastening on the door. None of the bunks block the door or stand below the beam. Many small but worthless items, such as clothing, footwear, sacks, rope, et al. are under the bunks and in the boxes, but no treasure is here. The south torch is the one which, if pulled down, opens a three-foot­ wide, four-foot-tall secret door leading to area 243. The spiked beam is a trap on the secret door leading to area 245 (q. v.). An attempt to disconnect (remove) it, if unsuccessful, inflicts 2-12 points of damage to the person making the attempt, as the beam swings down and smashes the secret door open with a crash. 243. ROOM, 20' x 30' Eight bandits (Level O) are here with two serjeants (Level 2 Fighters). Their leaders are in the small adjacent rooms (A and B). Four bandits in chain mail are seated at a central trestle table, drinking beer, their shields set beside them. Two others in scale mail are lounging by the west doors, and two more in simple leather are seated on stools by the fireplace in the south wall, cradling their trusty crossbows. (They can fire quickly at intruders.) The serjeants are at ease on their beds in the south corners of the room. Each crossbowman has a case of 20 bolts. All the bandits wear black, and each carries 2-8 gp. Each serjeant carries 21-30 gp. Noise of attack most certainly rouses the leaders from their private rooms. Com­ mander Feldrin (see room 243a) fights along with his troops as long as they seem to have a good chance of winning, but tries to 73 escape if defeat seems imminent. However, Lieutenant Brunk, a half-ore, hates Feldrin and desires his command. If the commander is imperiled, Brunk does not aid him, and may actually assist in his demise if this can be accomplished without revealing his acts to the troops. Bandits (4 at table): AC 4 (chain & shield), MV 9", Level O, hp6, 4, 4, 4, #AT l, D l-8 (longsword); XP 16, 14 (x3) Bandits (2 at doors): AC 6 (scale mail), MV 9", Level 0, hp 6, 5, #AT 1, D 1-10 (halberd); XP 16, 15 Bandits (2 on stools): AC 8 (leather armor), MV 12 N, Level 0, hp 7, 4, D 1-6 (shortsword) or 2-5 (light crossbow); XP 16, 15 Serjeants (2 on beds): AC 4 (chain & shield), MV 9 ", Level 2 Fighter, hp 15, 12, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword); XP 21, 18 Under duress, the serjeants admit that their masters often use disguises to spy in Nulb, Hommlet, and other towns. This 20 ' x 30' room is lit by four torches in wall sconces. This place con­ tains a pair of beds, a trestle table, two benches, two chairs, a writing table, a wardrobe, and four stools. At the foot of each bed is a large chest. A small fire burns in the fireplace in the south wall, over which part of a sheep is cooking on a spit. A flowing water fountain in the east wall spills into a basin below it. Rush mats cover the floor, and a few rag­ ged tapestries adorn the walls. Two small kegs (of beer, by their aroma) are on the table; numerous drinking vessels and dishes are on wall shelves. 243a. COMMANDER'S QUARTERS Commander Feldrin, a sharper (Level 7 thief), lives here. Horned red skulls are worked on the chest and back of his cloak of protection + 2 and leather armor + 1, and he wears a similar symbol on a silver neck chain (worth 30 gp). His belt pouch is a small bag of holding (1,000 gp capacity) containing 2-12 of each coin type. Feldrin: AC 1 (leather + 1), MV 12", Level 7 Thief, hp 33; XP 989; S 15 I 13 W 9 D 18 Co 15 Ch 17; #AT 1, D 4-10 (broadsword +2) 0NGiITAL ADVEITTV'S REiITCAR._IlATED • THE TEDlPLE 0F ELEDlEilTAL EVIL If captured, Feldrin does not speak unles forced, but he might tell of the Greater Temple two levels below and the fearsome things therein. (He has ben there only a few times and cannot guide adventurers beyond the stairs to Dungeon Level Thre-the flight just north of area 204.) He does speak of the rivalries of the various minor Temples, laughing at them, for he knows that there are ettins, demons, and other horrible creatures serving the Great Priests below. He wil always attempt to bar­ gain for his life, or to escape (as opportunity presents). This small 10 ' square side room is lit by a hanging lamp of dull metal. It contains a bed, stand, chair, wardrobe, and chest. A small rug is on the floor near the bed. A cup, ewer, and box are on the stand. In the southwest corner is a black candela­ brum with four unlit candles. The lamp is unpolished silver, worth 120 gp. The rug is of quite fine manufacture, worth 260 gp. The cup, ewer, and box are wrought gold, worth 200 gp, 27S gp, and lSO gp respectively; the last contains sweet­ meats, the others wine. The chest is locked and doubly trapped with a poisoned needle in the lock and poison gas inside, which fills the whole room unless the trap is removed (save or die). The chest contains clothing and the like, a sack (containing 112 pp and 74 gp), a silver bracelet set with much fine jade (jewelry value 1,700 gp), a small lumpy velvet bag (which holds 6 zircons worth SO gp each), two potion vials (one healing, one invisibility), and a bone scrollcase (with an illusionist spell, misdirection). 243b. LIEUTENANT'S QUARTERS Brunk, a half-ore Fighter/ Assassin, dwells here. As previously noted, he hates Feldrin and covets his command. Brunk dresses in black leather armor and wears a short black cape as well. His black shield, adorned with the device of the red horned skull, is specially designed to hold six darts, each of which is treated with deadly poison (though the victim gains a + 2 bonus to the saving throw). He also wears a ring of pro­ tection + 2, and a gold earring (100 gp) inset with a tiny ruby worth 1,000 gp. His purse holds 8 ep and 16 gp. Brunk knows little of the Greater Temple -only what Feldrin has told him. In case of attack he alerts those in area 243 or 244 (as appropriate) before emerging for battle. He tries to use his darts (fire rate 3 per round, with + 1 "to hit" bonus due to 16 Dexterity) before engaging, and of course uses his assassin skills if possible. Brunk: AC 4 (leather & shield), MV 12 H' Level 4/4 Fighter/Assassin, hp 28, #AT 1, D 1-8 (longsword) or 2-S (dager + 1), SA 6 poi­ soned darts, class abilities; XP 868 244. LOUNGE Light in this room is not usually visible from the southern approach, as a heavy drape hangs inside the door. A peep hole therein per­ mits observation by the occupants. The guards in this room are loyal to Brunk, the half-ore bandit lieutenant (se room 243b). This detachment consists of four Level 0 bandits (two human, two half­ orc) and one half-ore leader (Level 3 Fighter). Each is garbed in black; the swordsman also has a black cape. The two human bandits are scurvy knaves who prefer half-ore company to human. One of this pair watches at a peep hole in the south door, and alerts the others if intruders are sighted. Each wears leather armor, carries a light crossbow with 20 bolts, and has 2-S gp. The two half-ore bandits wear chain mail and shield; each carries a spear, shortsword, and coin purse containing 3 cp, 3 sp, 3 ep, 3 gp, and 1 pp. The swordsman, leader of this detach­ ment, is fanatically loyal to Brunk, and will remain so whatever occurs. He does what­ ever. Brunk wishes. He wears plate & shield, carnes 31 gp and 4 pp, and has a dagger with a tourmaline (worth 17S gp) set in the pommel, which was given him by Brunk. His 17 Strength gives him a + 1 bonus on "to hit" and damage rolls.

A heavy drape hangs on the eastern portion of the south wall. A brazier and pair of torches (in sconces) both light and warm the room. The 10' square alcove to the north contains a pair of rude cots and a small table; the latter holds a flagon and several ceramic mugs. The drape covers the south door, so that light shows neither from the cracks nor the peep hole. The flagon contains wine. 245. RECEPTION HALL This 40' x SO ' chamber was evidently one in which new arrivals were hosted to the delights of the Temple; at least, this is what the wall murals depict. A few pieces of battered furniture-couches chairs, and stands-remain along thǌ walls. In the center of the room is a shal­ low pool, its fountain apparently stopped and the decorative statue, of a minotaur sitting on a throne, much dirt­ ied. Several skeletons lie about the place, and some odd skulls and bones as well - mostly humans, but some humanoids also. None of the many cressets and walls sconces are lit; no torches remain. The minotaur is alive. It wears gray leather armor, and is dirtied to appear as if stone, 90% undetectable as real unless stud­ ied within lS foot range-and it attacks ǋefore such an approach. This monster par­ ticularly hates the bandits; after it killed (and ate) one, they harrassed it, shot it with bolts, and have tried to starve it (despite the fact that it is here, guarding against intruders, on instructions from Temple offi­ cials). It therefore charges whenever it ses black-clad intruders, even if it has little hope of prevailing. It otherwise attacks any­ one approaching within 20 feet. Minotaur: AC 4, MV 12 ", HD 6 + 3, hp 3S, #AT 2, D 2-8 butt or 1-4 bite/4-9 (flail), SD surprised on 1 only (on ld6); XP 680 Under the stone throne is a bag with 13 agates of various types (worth 10 gp each) and a scroll of protection from elementals (all). 246. CIRCULAR STAIRWAY This alcove is at the base of a stairway which circles counter-clockwise upward leading to area 1S3 (Dungeon Level One). ' 0R,jGiIIAL ADVEII'fVRJOS REi IICAR_IIA'fED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EIITAL EVIL This level was designed to Zuggtmoy's specifications. When she reigned over the Temple, the northernmost portion of the area (339-353) was for rewarding the "faithful", as well as for her personal pleasure. Worship­ pers could receive audience with their Mis­ tress or Her ministers without being initiated into the secrets of the Greater Temple on the level below. Councils and similar matters were likewise conducted in these rooms and chambers. The southern portion of the level (the whole) housed Zuggtmoy's trusted ser­ vants and her "pets"; a few of the latter still remain. When the Temple was overthrown, the magical sealing of the place (to imprison Zug­ gtmoy) also sealed off the northern portion of this dungeon level. The entire wall separating the northern and southern portions is thus magical, radiating a strong dweomer. It defies any attempts to pass through it, whether by physical or magical means (including even a wish). Similarly, the area cannot be examined by crystal ball or other scrying, and cannot be penetrated by way of teleport or dimension door, plane travel (including Ethereality), etc .. In short, the area can be penetrated only by direct entrance through the sealed bronze gate (area 340), or by finding a Key in one of the Elemental Nodes (q. v.) which transfer the user to one of the Elemental symbols in area 339. ------- Dungeon Level Three RANDOM ENCOUNTERS (Ignore in the northern area containing Zuggtmoy.)

DOMED HEXAGONAL CHAMBER The guardians of this chamber, currently in the side rooms (areas 302-305), issue from their lairs to investigate any intruder noises. This large chamber is empty and bare. The polished stones of its floor, walls, and vaulted ceiling are exceptionally smooth and closely fitted, and also seem to be of remarkable hardness. Each sound-footfall or spoken word­ echoes alarmingly in this place. Though two brackets for torches are mounted on each wall (flanking the doors), all are empty. The stairs to the east lead up to area 210 (Dungeon Level Two). 302-305. ROOMS, 30' x 20' One description (below) applies to each of these areas. Each occupant is a troll, guarding a key to one of the iron doors in area 306. In each case, the troll attacks any intruder not bearing the colors and identification symbols of the Greater Temple -black garb and golden skull, or a grinning homed skull, or an eye of fire. A visitor with proper identification may demand passage; if so, the troll fetches its key, accompanies the vis­ itor to the appropriate door, opens the door, and locks it after use. Having entered, a visi­ tor may later exit by banging on the door and getting the attention of the ettin in that area, who then fetches the appropriate troll. The keys in these rooms fit the doors in area 306 as follows: Room 302 303 304 305 has Key to Door (in area 306) a (north wall, west door) b (north wall, east door) c (west wall, north door) d (west wall, south door) Special Note, area 302: The secret door in the northwest wall has a concealed ring on its interior side. From without, it swings inward when pressure is applied at the bottom of the panel. The 5 ' wide passage connects areas 302 and 315. Descriptions A troll lairs here, its sworn duty being to prevent intruders from passing through area 301. When it hears noise therein, it emerges and moves to attack all unauthorized visi­ tors. However, it was once fed by clerics of the Air Temple, and so does not attack those garbed accordingly-though it requests food from them ("plenty of nice flesh!") and does not allow them passage through an iron door (in area 306).

The floor is covered with a filthy litter of dung, bones, trash, and bits of cloth. An iron hook protrudes from the far wall, from which a large key depends. A huge iron eye bolt is sunk in the stone of this same wall, and from it runs a thick iron chain, five feet long, its end broken. The glint of metal can be seen when the rubbish on the floor is moved. Scattered on the floor are 2-20 of each coin type (pp, gp, ep, sp, cp). Searching reveals 1-10 misc. coins per tum per person. 306. SQUARE CHAMBER An ettin dwells herein. Though he hates the trolls (areas 302-305), they are too numerous for him to do much more than harass them occasionally. He serves as an additional guard and beastkeeper. He car­ ries a firepot on his belt, and one of his clubs is oil-soaked (so he can light it and threaten a troll or two when the opportunity arises). A sack hanging from his belt contains 157 gp, 5 azurites, 6 hematites, and 7 tiger eyes (each gem worth 10 gp), and a box of carved ivory (worth 100 gp) in which are six blocks of incense of meditation. Ettin: AC 3, MV 12 ", HD 10, hp 53, #AT 2, D 2-16/3-18, SD surprised only on a l; XP 2692 The ceiling of this large 50' square cham­ ber is at least 40 feet high. Over a great fire pit (now cold) in the center of the room hang several large chains, one of which suspends a great iron pot. Several eye bolts are set in the walls, to each of which is attached a 10' long chain. Beside 76 each door is an empty torch bracket. Each of the four iron doors leading out of the chamber-two on the north wall, two on the east-is secured by a large lock. A great heap of cloth, pillows, and skins lies in the southwest comer, with a tun, barrel, and sack nearby. The pot contains a scummy broth, the remains of the ettin's last meal. One giant weasel pelt in the bed-pile is worth 2,00 gp. The sack nearby is filled with dried, smoked meat-probably bugbear or ogre. The locks on the iron doors can be picked, knocked open, or physically forced, though the last option requires 1-4 hours of grueling work, creates great amounts of noise, and attracts the attention of all creatures nearby. 307. GROTIO This is the domain of two leucrotta, pre­ vious pets of Zuggtmoy. Their den is the small cave to the southeast of the circular chamber. They are now cared for by the ettin (area 306), but not nearly often enough to suit them; they are voracious. This circular chamber, some 40 feet in diameter and 40 feet high at the apex of its dome, is made to appear as if it were a natural setting (albeit bleak and disquiet­ ing). The walls are hewn to appear as boulders, and detritus is spread by the walls. Jagged rocks likewise protrude from the perimeter in seemingly natural manner. Even in the relatively open cen­ ter, the floor is uneven, with cracks, ledges, and loose rock. The whole area is dimly lit by a gray light, with no apparent source but none­ theless leaving pools of shadows near the walls. A cold, damp breeze moans and sighs throughout, and the air smells foul. A bone projects from a fissure to the east, and near it is a full skeleton clad in chain mail. A leering skull atop a low slab of rock to the northwest seems to taunt you. The leucrotta attack anyone foolish enough to enter their grotto unless the intruder is a demon or some other monster obviously involved with the Greater Temple (on Dungeon Level Four; note that anyone bearing the "branched staff", described in area 427, commands their respect). 0NGi il.A.L ADVEITTV'S REi ITC.A.R_Il.A.TED • THE TED:r:PLE 0F ELED:r:EllTAL EVIL Leucrotta (2): AC 4, MV 18#, HD 6 + 1, hp 34, 29, #AT l, D 3-18, SA imitate voices, SD kick hooves in retreat (D 1-6/1-6); XP 747, 7fJ7 The skeleton in the grotto is dwarven, clad in chain mail + 1. At the bottom of a nearby crack (three feet deep and six inches wide), just a foot or two from the skeleton's right hand, is an axe + 1. A backpack under the skeleton contains typical adventuring equipment, and a belt pouch holds eight vials of holy water. In the den is another dwarven skeleton, scattered in many pieces. Mixed with the bones are five quarrels + 3, a broken light crossbow, a broken shield, tattered chain mail, an intact shortsword, and a belt with four small pouches fashioned thereon as part of the belt. One pocket holds three gems (an amethyst and two pearls, each worth 100 gp); the other thre pockets are empty. This belt magically reduces weight; each pocket can hold 100 gp (or ten pounds weight) as if it were but 1 gp (or a tenth of a pound). However, nothing larger than one by two by thre inches can fit into a pocket, and the maximum cubic volume capacity for a pocket is three by six by twelve inches. (Thus, vials of holy water would easily fit, but a dagger or wand would not, in most cases.) The belt is worth 5,00 gp (XP Value 1,00). 307a. STAIRS The exit south from the leucrotta cham­ ber opens into a 10' wide corridor leading west, which ends in a set of stairs. The stairs descend 20 feet and turn northward, contin­ uing down to Dungeon Level Four, area 401. 308. FOUNTAIN Horrid faces, carved from the same rock as the passage, snarl and vomit forth thin streams of water which are caught in a multi-tiered basin. The liquid has an evil smell, and the basin has become lined with some sort of aquatic growth. How­ ever, the water is probably drinkable. The water is rather sulphurous but potable. 309. BRONZE PIT The corridor, thus far unremarkable, sud­ denly drops off. You stand at the brink of an area of 16 foot depth, its sides and floor sheathed in smooth, highly pol­ ished bronze. The corridor continues east 20 feet, opening into a chamber like­ wise adorned. Further progress is possi­ ble by using narrow ledges along the north and south walls of this corridor, each being a mere six inches wide-or, of course, you may climb down in or tra­ verse the depression by magical means. A few scraps of trash litter the floor­ a bit of cloth, a small bone, and possibly a broken dagger. Your lights reflect well from the mirror-like sheets of bronze. If the corridor ceiling is examined or approached, use the following description. Some sort of metal gridwork is pressed against the stone overhead. From a point 10' west of the room, it extends east into it, being about 35 feet long and five feet wide; it is affixed to the northern half of the corridor ceiling. The grillwork con­ sists of three long bronze rods latticed by slightly smaller rods at intervals of 18 inches or thereabouts. A heavy bronze chain hangs from its east end, in the room, down to a point ten feet above the floor. This is a ladder which can be pulled down by 250 or more pounds of weight. The west end remains fixed to the roof of the passage, as the east end swings down into the pit (working rather as a modern fire escape lad­ der). Note that users must keep hold of it or weight it, else it swings back up into storage position. If used, the noise as it hits the floor brings the occupant of the place (in area 309a) rushing forth at full speed! Read the following if the main chamber is observed. The chamber is octagonal, its sides and floor still sheathed in polished bronze. The six-inch wide ledge extends around it at the height of the entry corridor, 16 feet above the floor. In the ceiling, which is cleanly cut from the surrounding rock, are eight holes, each about two inches across, placed to form a circle in the cen­ ter of the ceiling above the chamber. Two arched portals near the floor are visible in the north and south walls, each being six feet wide and nine feet tall. 77 Note that noise herein does not attract the occupant of area 309a unless intruders are on or near the floor of the area. The holes in the ceiling are the only remnants of an ear­ lier plan to construct a hanging observation gallery, never completed; Zuggtmoy simply walked along the ceiling to view the speci­ men, and others were uninterested. All the bronze is magical, enchanted to prevent the area's occupant from burrowing out. The creature will use the ladder if possi­ ble. 309a. SOUTH CUBICLE This is the current lair of an umber hulk,. who alternates its habitat between this and the northern cubicle. It is occasionally fed by the ettin (area 306). If presented with the opportunity, it climbs the ladder in prefer­ ence to attacking intruders, as this is its most likely means of escape. If freed, it tries to devour one man-sized victim, kill 5-8 others to satisfy its long-pent rage at its cap­ tivity (whether characters or local resi­ dents), and then dig its way out of the dungeons. Umber hulk: AC 2, MV 6# (1 w-6w), HD 8  + 8, hp 50, #AT 3, D 3-12/3-12/2-10, SA gaze (save vs. spells or be confused 3-12 rounds); XP 190 Through the south archway is a 10 ' cubicle. Its floor is covered with piles of cloth, skins, hides, and furs, creating a nest-like area in the center. A small basin of water on the east wall is fed by a small bronze gargoyle face which spits liquid into the bowl, where a small drain takes away the excess. If 15 man-turns are spent searching this room, a pair of small-sized boots of elvenkind is found. These fit any person of gnome size or thereabouts, possibly a small­ footed human female. 309b. NORTH CUBICLE Through the north archway is a 10' cubi­ cle. Its floor is a litter of bones, shredded cloth and leather, broken weapons, bits of rope, and other items. The room is foul, and stinks. Scattered amidst the mess are a few coins of various types. Herein are a leather wand case containing 0NGiilAL ADVEilTVRJ:S REiilCAR._IlATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEilTAL EVIL a wand of lightning (5-50 charges), a pouch which holds five pieces of jewelry (each worth 300-1800 gp), and an alabaster flask (worth 25 gp) filled with perfume (a rare sort worth 1,400 gp). Scattered about are 50-300 cp, 30-120 sp, 20-80 ep, 10-60 gp, and 5-50 pp. If-and only if-all of the coins are dug out of the trash, involving 12 man-turns of work, 3-12 gems (each worth 50 gp) can also be found. 310. SUNLIT ROOM As soon as you turn the bend in the pas­ sage, you se what appears to be a sunlit area to the northwest. The corridor is only dimly illuminated at the bend, due to a shimmering haze, but the light grows brighter towards the area ahead. Continue if the room is approached. Just before entering the place, you se small dim shapes moving about. Though the haze distorts them, they appear to be giant rats and foxes. The are11 is a 20 ' x 30 ' room, the ceiling (if there is one) is impossible to see, due to the bright light. Blue sky and a hot sun seem to be over­ head, but the sky appears close-only 20 feet up, or thereabouts. In each of four alcoves in the northern portion of the chamber (two in the north wall, one to either side, and all about ten feet above the floor) sits a harpy, gazing with evident pleasure at the scene below. Centered below is a raised slab of rock, upon which are chained a man and a woman. Swarming around this table-like slab are a score of jackals and twice as many giant rats. Al are attempting to clamber up to devour the victims, but the rock is quite smooth and evidently slip­ pery, for only rarely does one of the beasts manage to leap up and attack. The chains have sufficient slack to enable the prisoners to defend themselves slightly; thus, when bitten, the victim can move away or lash out. Each prisoner has a few bites evident, but more often than not they strike the attacking beast off the rock. To tantalize the captives, several items lay atop the slab just out of their reach: a large ring with a key in it, a dagger, a longsword, and a rod of some sort. As you observe this tableaux, the prisoners notice your presence and cry out for aid! The rats, foxes, and jackals take no notice, but the harpies look up, notice you, and open their mouths. Most of this area radiates magic. The har­ pies are actually gargoyles; the prisoners are actually jackalweres. The rats and foxes are illusory, but the jackals and items are real. The deceptions are from a permanent ilu­ sion, other elements of which are the cap­ tives' wounds and chains. A few jackals were waiting at the bend in the passage, and ran back when intruders were sighted to warn their masters, the jack­ alweres, of the approaching food . . . . The initial attack by the gargoyles is pref­ aced by their squawking, slightly similar but in no way as effective as that of real har­ pies. As these monsters squawk and fly in to attack, the normal jackals also turn to devour intruders. While these attacks occur, the jackalweres (still playing prisoner) add their sleep gazes to disable intruders. If this is noticed or if the gargoyles start losing the fight, the jackalweres "break" their illusory chains, grab their very real weapons, and move in for the attack while exclaiming their intent to aid the party. The male uses the longsword; the female, the mace (which appeared to be a rod) and the dagger (gain­ ing two attacks per round). If grappled, they drop their weapons and shift form to jackal-headed guise, resorting to bite attacks.

The loot includes 104 cp, 171 sp, 223 ep, 410 gp, 67 pp, 9 gems (roll for random value), two pieces of jewelry (random value), a potion of plant control, 78 and a scroll of four magic-user spells (spider climb, levitate, infravision, extension [). 311. CHAMBER Of STATUES This circular chamber, some 40 feet in diameter, is lit by four weirdly glowing globular cressets of ancient bronze. The light reveals nine monstrous statues, whose stoney visages are still sufficient to strike fear into the heart. Beyond a smallish blue dragon is a beholder; a fire giant, manticore, and medusa seem to stand in frozen conversation; and off to one side are a mummy, an ogre mage, a wight, and a rakshasa. The lights are will-o-wisps, shedding a dim violet radiance. They wait until the characters' attentions are concentrated on the statues (and the items they have, and the implied threats; see below). At that time, the 'wisps slowly glide forward, cleverly dimming their lights so shadows and light intensity do not betray their movement, and suddenly attack in concert. If two are slain, the others flee. In each of the four cressets is a star sapphire worth 1,00 gp. Will-o-wisps (4): AC -8, MV 18", HD 9, hp 40, 38, 36, 33, #AT 1, D 2-16, SD imune to most spells, can become invisible for 2-8 rounds; XP 1680, 1656, 1632, 1596 Beholder This statue seems to gaze fixedly upon a scroll tube lying before it. The tube is protected by a fire trap. It con­ tains a scroll of protection from magic. Dragon From the head formation, this must be a blue dragon. It seems to be admiring a copper bound box which is filled with gems. The box is two feet wide and tall, and three feet long. It contains 200 quartz gems (base value 1 gp each, maximum value 10 gp each). The box itself is magical, with invisi­ ble runes scribed upon its front; these reveal four command words. The first shrinks the box to a twelfth of normal size, with all con­ tents likewise becoming minute. The weight 0RjGiIIAL ADVEII'f'V'S REiIICARJIA'f'ED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEllTAL EVIL of the shrunken chest, empty or filled, is 30 pounds. The second word causes the chest (if normal sized) to function as one upon which a Leomund's secret chest spell has been placed (but with no smaller replica necessary!). The third word causes the box to return to full size or normal place, as applicable. The fourth word causes growth to quadruple dimensions, with sides, top, and bottom of one foot thickness, huge cop­ per bands, and a weight of 1,;mo pounds. Fire Giant The mighty right hand of this statue bears a spear, held like a dart. This is a spear + 2, cursed backbiter (see DMG page 169). Manticore This stone monster appears to be poised over a crossbow. This is a crossbow of speed, but its string is missing. It will not fire until a new one is added with an enchant weapon then placed upon it, or until a string from another magi­ cal crossbow is used. Furthermore, the new string will break if a "to hit" roll of a natural 20 is rolled for firing a bolt. Medusa This figure wears a velvety cloak of deep black. This is a cloak of poisonousness (se DMG page 141), which can be handled safely but, when donned, instantly slays the wearer (no saving throw). Mummy This detailed sculpture holds a staff in one hand and a ceramic bottle in the other. The former item is a normal quarterstaff upon which a glyph of warding (blindness) has been placed. The bottle holds a pint of strong acid (a double-sized flask, for D 4-16 when thrown as a grenade-like missile, or 4 splashes to 10' range, damage 1 per splash). Ogre mage This statue is adorned with a silver chain around its neck, from which depends a silver globe with the face, in bas relief, of the Man in the Moon. The neck.lace is magical. It holds, and keeps permanent (until used), a pebble simi­ lar to a sling stone which is an Otiluke's freezing sphere. This can be detached and hurled to 60' range, then bursting and inflicting 4-24 points of cold damage to each victim within ten feet. Rakshasa One of the stoney digits of this horrid statue is circled by a golden ring. This is a ring of delusion which performs as X-ray vision for one turn before becom­ ing absolutely false and useless. Wight This stone figure crouches before a silver urn, perhaps some form of funerary ves­ sel. The urn is platinum, an ancient votive worth 20,00 gp. Inside is a fine magical powder, dust of sneezing and choking, which spills out if the vessel is examined. Each creature within 20 feet at that time is disabled for 5-20 rounds, and must make a saving throw vs. poison or die. None of the dust can be recovered or saved for later use. 312. EARTH-FLOORED AREA The whole floor of this chamber is cov­ ered with a noisome earth, soil that con­ tains much manure and other rotting things. From this sickening humus spring numerous thin-stalked fungi growths, thicker ones bearing strange caps, spongy-looking growths, and various shelf-fungi and tumerous spherical blobs growing from niches and shelves placed along the walls. These latter growths, as well as a few of those growing from the floor, give off a ghostly phosphorescent illumination. As you set foot in the place, you hear a female voice call out a warning to "stand still! Some of the fungi are dangerous. I 79 know the path, and will come to guide you". You see a comely head moving this way and that through the huge fungi, evidently following a winding course through the growths. The lamia in this area tends the "garden;' awaiting Zuggtmoy's return. While at a dis­ tance, she first casts a charm person spell at the most powerful-looking character. Before checking its success, she then uses suggestion on another character, saying that some fungi cause insanity, and he or she must aid in restraining any character who insanely attacks others. The lamia then advances under the illusion of being an armor-dad female. fighter, while asking the (hopefully) charmed victim to turn and check the other characters for insanity. The monster then attacks with her shortsword + 1 (gaining a + 1 strength bonus to damage) and wisdom-draining touch, engaging two different opponents if at all possible. She does not attack the vic­ tims of her charm and suggestion spells if they seem to have succumbed to the enchantments. She concentrates the touch attacks on one opponent, if possible, and continually urges the victim to turn and aid her in attacking the others "who are obvi­ ously insane, from the fungi". If the victim's Wisdom reaches 2, he or she will comply. If damaged significantly, the lamia flees into the maze of fungi, casts a mirror images spell (producing three images), and immedi­ ately returns to the fray. Lamia: AC 3, MV 24 *, HD 9, hp 48, #AT 2, D 3-8 (weapon)/O + wisdom drain (touch), SA spells, XP 2276 The monster wears a gold necklace (worth 1,000 gp) set with five star rubies (each worth 1,00 gp). Extremely careful or magical examination also reveals a pair of bracers of defense AC 6 hidden on her long­ haired legs. The door at the southwest corner leads to stairs up, which end at area 222a (Dungeon Level Two). 312a. STAIRS The exit at the southeast corner of the lamia chamber opens into a 10' wide corri­ dor, jogging south and continuing east, which ends in a set of stairs. The stairs 0RjGiilAL ADVEilTV'S REiilCAR._IlATED • THE TElhPLE 0F ELElhEilTAL EVIL descend 20 feet and tum northward, contin­ uing down to Dungeon Level Four, area 401. 313. CIRCULAR SHAFT This area is not in use; the floor is cov­ ered with dried husks, castings, and other less definable litter. Heavy webs mask the ceiling, but they are at least 20 feet up, so it must be some distance beyond. The dust and dirt collected on the strands of spidersilk show that the monster which made them is probably no longer here. The trap door in the northwest part of the floor is well hidden. A small stone flag must be lifted to reveal the door's opening ring. Steep steps lead down to a passage, the floor of which is about 15 feet below that of this chamber. The steps are worn and relatively clean. A small twig broom lies at the bottom of the steps, used to maintain the trap door's obscurity. 314. CHAMBER OF EYES For each tum that the party spends in here, a 50% chance exists that an inhabitant of a connecting room (315-318) will enter. Use ld4 for random selection. The plastered walls of this triangular room are covered with paintings of eyes and the symbol of the Eye of Fire-an equilateral triangle with a "Y" shape within, the branches at the base comers and the stem meeting the apex. The eyes are of all sorts-human and monstrous, blind-looking, multi-faceted, and of var­ ious colors-and all seem to stare in hatred, hunger, or fright. The chamber has seen rather rough use of late, for there are piles of rubbish scat­ tered about, gnawed bones, and signs of a large fire apparently frequently burned in the middle of the floor. Just ten feet south of the steps to the north is a large brass gong, suspended from a homwood frame. Two smoky cressets burn on the east and west walls, about midway between each pair of doors. The stairs to the north lead upwards to area 209a (Dungeon Level Two). The gong can be rung by striking it with any blunt weapon or similar object. The sound will arouse all those nearby (areas 315-318). 315. HEXAGONAL CHAMBER Six bugbears are quartered herein. Origi­ nally, they and their captain were to patrol for intruders and keep the fighting between the factions to a minimum, preventing the destruction of the real strength of the whole Elemental Evil effort. They are thus dressed in black. They are now simply staying here, keeping out of sight and "dogging it" (so to speak). If they discover intruders or are attacked, they shout to alert their fellows (in areas 316-318) or strike the warning gong, whichever is the more easily accomplished. The bugbears do not know of the existence of the secret passage which leads to area 302. Each has a small bag of unappetizing foodstuffs and miscellaneous junk, along with 2-8 pp, 4-16 gp, and 5-30 ep.

The stone here is of dull ocher. The ceiling arches to a height of about 25 feet in the center. A large iron brazier stands in the center of the room, and a rude table by the south wall. Six heaps of old cloth (rugs, tapestries, clothing, and badly cured animal skins) lie on the floor. 316. HEXAGONAL CHAMBER Two bugbear leaders (of those in area 315) live here. Each is likewise clad in black. In the event of trouble, these monsters rely on their own force, not calling on those in areas 317 or 318. Each gains a + 1 strength bonus to damage. They flee any unfavorable encounter if possible.

The larger wears an elec­ trum armlet (worth 30 gp) and a silver belt buckle (15 gp); the other wears a gold earring in one nostril (20 gp). 80 Torch brackets are affixed to the walls of this hexagonal chamber, but without torches. The stone here is of mottled rust and moss-green hue. The ceiling arches to a height of about 25 feet in the center. A large iron brazier stands in the center of the room, and a rude table by the south wall, with a cabinet nearby. Two heaps of pillows, cushions, and old doth (rugs, tapestries, etc.) lie on the floor. The cabinet holds some smoked meat, cheese, several bottles of wine, and eight battered silver plates (worth 25 gp each). 317. PLEASURE CHAMBER Four ogres use this room as a lair. They were originally sent to find out what the bugbears were doing; when they found them (and their master in area 318), they decided to stay, liking ease and the promise of lots of food and treasure. The former has been lacking, of late; they are hungry. They fight normally, and the weakest of the four is also a shaman, able to cast detect magic and light each day; he also has a javelin + 2 to hurl if hard-pressed. Each ogre has a large belt pouch contain­ ing 10-80 gp and 10-60 pp; the largest also has three carnelians (each worth 50 gp) hid­ den inside his jack.

The floor is a mosaic of like scenes. A few pieces of broken furniture are stacked near the fireplace in the west wall. Two heaps of rugs, skins, etc. are by the east wall, with two more near the southeast comer. Between them is a large barrel. Two small pots stand near the fireplace, and a large kettle is suspended over the dead ashes. Two unlit cressets are on each wall except the west. There are six in all. 0R,jGi ilAL ADVEilTVNOS REi ilCARJIATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELElhEilTAL EVIL The barrel contains 30 gallons of ale; the pots and kettle are empty. 318. PLEASURE CHAMBER Scorpp, a hill giant, dwells herein with his pet wolf (worg) Splot. The giant is a bit smarter than most of his kind-smart enough to know that he has discovered a way to live in ease, with slaves (the bug­ bears and ogres) but not bright enough to understand the consequences of his rebel­ lion. He thinks of himself as King in this area, and the ogres and bugbears are seen as his "loyal subjects" (slaves). He demands that half of the food and treasure taken be given to him. Scorpp has no intention of returning to the Greater Temple below, liking the free­ dom and position he has found. He will fight any intruder, regardless of their garb; but black-garbed enemies ensure his abso­ lute resistance, for he sees such as former superiors, coming to punish him for his fail­ ure to return. Scorpp keeps two boulders nearby for use as missiles prior to melee. If combat goes badly, he asks for quarter, offering to serve the opponents if his life is spared. He will, of course, seek to escape or kil his captors, as opportunity permits. He does know the way to the Greater Temple, and can estimate the number of bugbears ("more than fingers 'n' toes"), ogres ("many"), hill giants ("lots"), and ettins ("couple-tree o' dem").

The room description is the same as that for area 317, except that strange fung­ ous growths are also shown in the obscene mosaics. The room contains one large heap of bedding, an iron chest with a huge pad­ lock, and a thick rancid stew in the kettle in the fireplace. The chest contains 622 ep, 2783 gp, 17 gems worth 10 gp each (nine agates, four tiger eyes, and four bits of tur­ quoise), and a potion of red dragon control. 319. ROOM, 20' x 20' The oaken door is bronze-bound and held fast by a large bar and padlock as well. The lock can be picked or destroyed by 2S points of damage. The room is 20' square, with some filthy straw scattered on the floor, a small drain hole in the northwest corner, and a water-filled barrel . Herein are two humans, an ore, a hobgoblin, and three goblins. These are prisoners, captured on raids and kept as food. All are rather skinny and weak; none will serve with the party. All ask to be freed; the humans, who are farmers, also say that the others recently slew and ate their friend Charlie. The monsters can be slain without difficulty, if desired. 320. ROOM, 20' x 30' This oak door is heavily bound with bronze and secured by bar and heavy padlock. The lock can be picked or destroyed by 2S points of damage. The room is 20 ' x 30' ,  littered with straw. Herein are a gnoll, a bugbear, and two ogres. These creatures are malnourished and weak; all are sentenced to die for various acts of disobedience. None will serve with the party. If given the opportunity, they will try to slay and eat their rescuers; however, they can be slain without problem, due to their poor condition. 321. HALL OF BLACK FEASTING This 40' square room is floored in blocks of alternating red and black stone. The supports and ceiling are all black. The walls are plastered and decorated with scenes of horrid feasts-a banquet where ghouls, ghasts, shadows, and vampires join Temple clerics and demons in an unspeakable repast. The many cressets along the walls are unlit, for this place 81 seems to have been deserted for some time. Several long tables, chairs, and sideboards are here, all dusty but other­ wise in good condition. The tables still hold many dishes, platters, drinking ves­ sels, and containers. In four man-turns of searching, the party can find two golden settings. Each has four pieces: a flagon (2SO gp value), a platter (300 gp), a plate (17S gp), and a salt cellar (SO gp). The weight of each piece is half its gp value. 322. HALL OF ARMORED SKELETONS This 30 ' wide area is lined with disquiet­ ing guardians-or trophies. Thirteen human skeletons stand at attention along each wall, all clad in various forms of armor. Each holds a different pole arm or missile weapon. Four large bronze stands are by each wall, evidently candle hold­ ers, though no candles remain. Six pairs of crossed swords and six shields deco­ rate the north wall. The armor types and weapons are not important; they are all useless, being rusted, rotten, and decayed. If any of the swords and shields on the north wall are touched, one falls with a loud clatter, alerting the inhabitants of areas 323-324. One of the shields is a shield + 1, bearing the arms of Veluna in canton, with a gold field showing crossed billets proper. The four candle stands are worth S gp each. 323. SCARLET ROOM Eight shadows linger in this chamber, awaiting the return of Zuggtmoy and Iuz­ and thereby a return to the days of feasting and "sport" in the Temple. They are seldom fed, and are thus weak and hungry for life forces. If they hear noise in area 322, they hurry to investigate.

The floor, walls, and curved ceiling are each of a subtly different hue, to jar the vision of the onlooker. The overall impression is bloody and disgusting. Rotting cushions and divans, all of red cloth and again each slightly different from another, are scattered here and there. A low round table of wood lacquered in orange-red stands near the west end of the room; upon it is a red serving set of several cups and a bowl. Each of the two candelabra nearby holds 13 candle stubs. The red serving set is made of cinnebar, the whole worth 450 gp. The candelabra are made of solid rose gold; each weighs 1,200 gp and is worth 2,250 gp if maintained in good condition, or 1,200 gp if battered, bent, or dismantled. 324. BLACK ROOM As with area 323, eight shadows lurk herein, waiting for the return of the Temple's heyday. If noise is heard, they investigate rapidly, seeking life forces upon which they may feed. The strongest shadow carries a short baton-like rod of ebony, which is graven with the glyphs of Iuz and Zuggt­ moy. This device gives immunity from all Turning and undead control in a 10' radius, but its wielder cannot attack, as two hands are needed to carry the rod.

Couches and chairs of black wood remain here in good condition, upholstered in cloth of the same somber hue. A large black cabinet stands by the west wall. The four black metal sconces are solid sil­ ver, each weighing 100 gp and worth 50 gp due to their workmanship; if badly dam- aged, their value drops to that of the silver (5 gp). In the cabinet are several worthless scrolls and books, jars and other containers holding similarly worthless substances, a rope of 32 black pearls worth a total of 16,000 gp (mixed in with several pieces of worthless jewelry of black paste), a potion of hill giant strength, and a protection from undead scroll. A thorough search takes three turns. 325. KITCHEN From the appearance of a huge fireplace in the north end of this room, and the condition of various containers of foodstuffs-flour, meal, salt, oil, pre­ served meats and cheeses-it is apparent that this kitchen is still used occasionally. Enough food is here to feed several score people for many days. Shelves and long counters hold containers, foodstuffs, and cooking utensils: spits, skewers, long forks and spoons, ladles, etc. Behind a large open cupboard in the south section of the west wall is a concealed door. The room beyond contains barrels of beer, ale, wine, and even a small cask of brandy (40 pounds, 300 gp value). Also here are 26 crystal goblets and a matching decanter; this set fills three backpacks (assuming careful packing to avoid break­ age). The decanter is worth 200 gp; each goblet, 50 gp. 326. OPULENT BEDCHAMBER A groaning spirit, the banshee of the dead elf stretched out on the floor of the room, haunts this place. She lurks behind a folding screen. When intruders enter the room, she comes out (and each person seeing her must make a saving throw vs. spells or flee), wails (and each victim within 30 feet must make a saving throw vs. spells or die and then attacks anyone as yet unharmed. The ban­ shee hates all who now live, and fights fiercely until near extinction, when she finally tries to escape. If escape is impos­ sible, she offers a bribe for her survival; she knows where, as a living being, she hid an elven longbow + 1, cloak of elvenkind, and elfin chain mail suitable for any elfin female or other character of similar size (gp value 500, XP value 100). Note that these items, hidden somewhere near her chamber, will remain hidden for many years if she does 82 not reveal them.

Upon it lies the mummified body of an elf, face down just beyond the entryway with the hilt of a dagger protruding from its back. Its remains are clad in rotting splendor; the garments are of silk and brocade, and jewels gleam from earrings, a necklace, a bracelet, and two rings. The skeletal right hand clutches a carved stone of some sort. Near the body is a large curio cabinet, its door slightly ajar. The cabinet con­ tains mummified portions of humans, demi-humans, and humanoids, as well as small intricately carved statuettes and blocks of ivory, soapstone, and so forth-each depicting something obscene. The dark room has many unused can­ delabra and wall sconces. Its plastered walls are painted with scenes of deca­ dence, and the tapestries hanging here and there show similar scenes of deprav­ ity. A huge bed stands against the north wall, with a stand of carved wood to each side. A long, low table is flanked by couches; nearby is another such table with three plush chairs. In the southwest corner a folding screen of uskwood sepa­ rates a wardrobe, dressing table, and pil­ lowed stool from the rest of the place. Each of the skeleton's four pieces of jew­ elry (counting the pair of earrings as a single piece) is worth a base value of 2,000-8,00 gp. When checking each piece for detail and workmanship, apply a -1 bonus to the roll (on ldlO) for the first piece (only). In the skeletal hand is a periapt of proof against poison, + 3. Under the remains is a small pouch which holds a scroll of six magic-user spells (gust of wind, tongues, polymorph self, remove curse, airy water, and limited wish). The cabinet contains 13 carvings (base value 100-1000 gp each). Two tapes­ tries are valuable, worth 1,100 gp and 850 gp respectively, despite their small size. 0NGiIIAL ADVEIITV'S REiIICAR_IIATED • THE TE.lb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EllTAL EVI L 327. DINING SALON Above a long wooden table in the middle of this plastered and decorated room hangs a large chandelier. Twelve chairs flank the table. Two sideboards, a cabi­ net, and a wheeled cart complete the fur­ nishings. The furniture is good but not of great worth. All the valuable dishes and other items have been stripped from the room. 328. SJORAGE AREA This oddly shaped chamber is lined with shelves which still contain many empty containers; here are bottles, flasks, alem­ bics, retorts, and other such parapher­ nalia typical to an alchemist's or wizard's laboratory. On the floor are more mun­ dane items-a large box of chalk, sacks of charcoal, jugs of turpentine and fuel oil, candles of various colors, etc. Suffic­ ient material seems herein to stock a small shop and supply a magic-user or two as well. Nothing here is of high value, but the room contains nearly any commonplace item akin to those listed; use your judg­ ment. 328a. STAIRWAY The stairs here ascend to the east, leading to area 227a (Dungeon Level Two). 329. ALCHEMY WORKROOM The merest glance herein reveals the past purpose of this circular room a place for alchemical experimentation. The walls and floor are covered with graven sym­ bols, glyphs indicating the elements, metals, and other stuff of alchemy. Benches and work tables line the walls; upon them are flasks, retorts, crucibles, et al. Three braziers, each of a different size, are aligned in the middle of the room, piled with plates and dishes which hold heaps of strange powders, granules, and crystals. Beakers and flasks here and there are filled with odd substances. Careful inspection reveals metal in powder and chunk form, including 10-40 coins weight of each coin type (platinum, gold, electrum, silver, and copper), but no actual coins. A small pottery flask weighs over ten pounds; it contains 100 gp weight of quicksilver (mercury). worth 1,00 gp. To describe other items and materials found, refer to the DMG, pages 218 (the table for magic-user fur­ nishings) and 221-222 Appendix K, for specific substance descriptions). 330. LABORAJORY This area, 10' wide and 50 ' long, seems to hav.e been meant principally for the reading and writing of spells. Cressets are fitted to the walls at ten­ foot intervals. A long, slanted shelf is along the north wall, with many stools spaced along its 30' length. Sheets of vel­ lum and parchment still lie upon the shelf, accompanied on an upper ledge by quills of many sorts, small pots with oddly carved stoppers, and candlesticks. A small writing desk stands at the west end, and a lectern at the far east; oppo­ site each of these objects is an arched doorway, leading north. Several small chairs are nearby, along the south wall. Careful examination of the inkpots reveals one which is filled with magical ink, in a quantity sufficient to inscribe seven spells (and worth 700 gp). The nine rolls of papyrus (worth 2 gp each) and eleven sheets of parchment (worth 4 gp each) are usable for such work, but the five sheets of vellum (worth 8 gp each) are better (-5% chance of copying failure; see DMG page 117). The nine quills here are also of high quality, worth 2 gp each. The doorways open into the central labo­ ratory. Under a workbench, in the middle of the north wall, lurks a roper, hidden amidst materials and apparatus. It may attack when two or more victims are within 20' range; if others are approaching, it waits for up to six targets. The roper is large, very mean, and hungry. It managed to get in through flues and chimneys, but cannot now escape. It fears the ettin (in area 306) and so hides when it comes by, but has picked off a few hapless bugbears sent here from below to fetch magical goodies. The remains of its prey are in area 331. Note that the roper has 80% magic resistance, but is susceptible to fire (-4 saving throw penalty). It has 13 gems in its gut, each worth 50 gp 83 (five bloodstones, two jaspers, and six zir­ cons), along with the usual 3-18 pp. Roper: AC O; MV 3 "; HD 12; hp 71; #AT l; D 5-20; SA 6 strands (range 20-50 ' , poi­ son for 50% strength loss in 1-3 rounds); SD body mutability, immune to electric­ ity, half damage from cold; MR 80 % ; XP 3886 This inner chamber is obviously an abandoned laboratory for magical research and experimentation. Four long benches in this 80' x 20' area are filled with paraphernalia of all kinds. A flow­ ing fountain of water is in the southwest corner, but almost all of the rest of the wall is taken up by shelves supporting all sorts of containers-bottles, jars, boxes, baskets, jugs, flasks, vials, etc., of all shapes and sizes. These hold magical ingredients of virtually every imaginable sort, from rare herbs and spices to mon­ ster parts and fluids. Included are ape teeth, basilisk scales, cockatrice feathers, elephant hide, fox dung, gorgon tongue, hydra blood, and other materials, of all sorts of colors and consistencies. Cup­ boards sometimes replace open shelves. Many open bins are also built into the shelves; these contain different sorts of earth, seeds, bits of fur, dried leaves of various sorts, flower petals, bark chips, and metals of various forms and types­ including rods, wire, small ingots, thin strips, chunks, filings, and powder of iron, brass, tin, lead, zinc, bronze, steel, and others unknown to you. The paraphernalia on the benches con­ sists of the following items: First Bench Second Bench bellows balance bottles bowls cannisters knife crucible mirror file mortar flasks pans funnel pestle furnace phials ladle sandglass metal ingots tongs retorts vials tweezers weights 0R.iGiilAL ADVEil1'VRJ;:S REiilCAR._IlA'fED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EilTAL EVIL 0RiGinAL ADVEil'fV'S REiilCAR_IlATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EnTAL EVIL Third Bench basins beakers caddy dishes jars jug kettle pipette prisms spatula spirit lamp tubes Fourth Bench alembics cauldron cruets decanter jars lenses mixing rods needles paddle scalpel spoons tubing The: unknown metals include aluminum, magnesium, tungsten, and others. Each 300 gp encumbrance of materials (contained in a backpack, for example) is worth 1,00 gp if carefully selected, half that if carelessly scooped up, or double value if painstak­ ingly chosen (requiring a full man-turn per pack). A maximum of 1500 gp encumbrance of valuables can be thus gathered. One pack of these materials will produce 1-4 needed or useful items (such as magical components for spells, potions, and scrolls). To determine suitability for any given use, have the player state what specific item is sought, and roll ld6; the sought item is found on a 1. (You may allow specific search for and discovery of powdered gems, types of blood, or other unusual items specified by players. If so, allow one chance in 12 per man-turn of search for discovery of an eas­ ily recognized item, or the same chance for other items but counting only those magic­ users searching.) The alcoves to the east area are described below. 330a. NORTHERN ALCOVE This 10' square room contains tripods, quadrapods, lamps, plumb lines, dividers, candles of different sizes, shapes, and col­ ors, chalk of al sorts, paints of many hues, and metal devices-small distillers, melt­ ing pots, etc. 330b. SOUTHERN ALCOVE This 10' square room contains a long table heaped with many lengths of plain linen. A magical circle is drawn around the table on the floor. On the shelves are many body parts and monsters' organs, each preserved in some solution in a jar or tank. Here are also scalpels, knives, saws, needles, and thread. Several books and scrolls lie on one of the shelves. Under the linens is a construct, a vaguely humanoid monster created with various parts of beasts and monsters. It was begun as a joke, but wasn't finished, due to the fall of the Temple. It has an ogre's head and torso, gargoyle forelimbs, bear forelimbs, a bugbear's lower limbs, and the brains of a chipmunk. The books deal with the anatomy of vari­ ous creatures, theories of magical con­ structs, a treatise on the original flesh golem (dealing only with its nature, not a method of construction), and medical works. One of the scrolls is quite dangerous; if scanned for even a brief time, it summons a babau demon (hp 43). Two spell scrolls are here, one of four magic-user spells (magic mouth, fly, charm monster, polymorph other) and one of three cleric spells (animate dead, raise dead, restoration). The practical joke was to run as follows. Use the animate dead to bring the chipmunk-brained monster to life. A magic­ user then controls the thing (else it will scurry off in abject terror, chittering away with its great ogrish jaws, possibly harming someone in its path of retreat), applying a magic mouth and using charm monster for control. Cause the creature to fly out into the lab while another mage was at work, claim (with the magic mouth) to be a demon coming to punish some transgression, and change itself into the victim's form (actually being polymorphed by the controlling mage). All parties then sit back to watch the fun. In any event, if the animate dead is applied to the body, it rises and behaves in a manner appropriate to its chipmunk brains, and should serve to amuse the players (and yourself, of course!) for some time. 331. S10REROOM A few remaining containers and bales indicate that this place was once one in which mundane items were stored. It now contains a number of gnawed bones, torn garments, and broken weap­ ons; the latter items have been tossed into a pile. Someone or something has purposely used this place as a grisly repository for unwanted remains of meals. 85 The containers have been emptied of all valuable and usable materials. One holds wormy meal, another vinegar. The bones are primarily from bugbears, though the remains of an ogre, a gnoll, and a human skull are also here. 332. MUSEUM ROOM A lurker above dwells here. It was set as the guardian of the place by Iuz himself, just before he fled back to his own realm. As usual for its kind, the lurker will attack without hesitation and fight until dead.

Here are heads of all sorts, a few skulls, withered and bony hands, flayed skins, banners of many types, several plain crowns for wear atop helm or helmet, holy symbols of Good deities, surcoats, jupons, tab­ ards bearing arms and shields with like decorations, and small items such as rings, seals, and sigils. One case bears several maces and similar items, though these are obviously ceremonial and not meant for use as weapons. Cabinets in the center of the room are smashed and broken; many bones litter the floor. The five plain crowns are only worth 1 gp each. One platinum ring is set with a fine diamond (total value 9,00 gp), and 10 of the rings are of value as jewelry (base value 1,000-4,00 gp each). One of the ceremonial maces is solid silver, set with many gems. Its value is 12,500 gp as is, or 6,750 gp if dis­ mantled and sold for the value of the bullion (750 gp) and gems (60 worth 100 gp each, including equal numbers of amethysts, gar­ nets, and tourmalines). 333. CHAPEL The black stone of this small area is draped with several white hangings, one edged in purple, one fringed with gold, and one cornered in silver. A small altar here is made of wood, painted white; 0NGiIIAL ADVEII'fV'S REi IICARJIATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EIITAL EVI L nearby is a reliquary, containing ashes of some sort. A silver votive lamp hangs over the altar. Upon the altar is a snowy cloth with red runes, stating (in Com­ mon): "VENERATE THIS SHRINE OF GOOD, THEN HASTE AWAY, ALL YE OF TRUE AND GOOD FAITH!" Affixed to the west (diagonal) wall is a sil­ ver cross, 2 feet across and 3 feet long. In the center of the northern wall is a small niche, in which stands a silver idol of Pholtus. This room bears no magic, but evil can be detected to the west. The trappings here are to delude those of Good alignment, while the silver is to discourage any demons from going places they should not. The silver lamp is worth 100 gp; the cross weighs 300 gp, and is worth 400 gp. The idol of Pholtus is worth 875 gp. 334. INKY CHAMBER This bare hexagonal room is dusty, cob­ webbed, and forgotten. Near the door is a rag-clad skeleton-probably some cleric who met his end herein, from unknown causes. The remains obviously harbor no treasure. A vague feeling of unease creeps over all who gaze into this place of darkness overlong. The place is empty. If magic is detected for, a strong pulse comes from the northwest; if evil is sought, the whole room is found to give off a dim radiation of malign power. If the place is investigated, continue: A black iron coffin stands by the north­ west wall; its iron lid, in which a silver cross has been inlaid, lies beside it. Atop the lid is a forgotten scroll case. An invisible sarcophagus is on the stand. Dispel magic, detect invisibility, dispel ilu­ sion, or dust of appearance reveals the fol­ lowing: The sarcophagus has no top. You se a vampire corpse, clad in black and appearing hale-except for the stake through its heart. This is an illusion. A gem of seeing, true seeing, or similar effect reveals the true occupant; see below for details. Similar magic also reveals that the silver cross in the coffin lid is a magical broadsword (Fra­ garach, fully described in Appendix C). The scroll tube contains two scraps of parchment. One is a scroll of two magic­ user spells (both strength); the other is a message: "Let the Good ones use their new­ found strength to seal in the horror of dark­ ness to prove their faithfulness to right and justice. We who wrote this lacked the power to do so:' Of course, it is a ghastly jape at the forces of Good. If the coffin's occupant is viewed truly, use the following description. Your powerful magic reveals a figure completely different from the vampire form. You se a handsome mail-dad human man with golden hair. He is clad in a white surcoat, quartered by the arms of Furyondy and Veluna and the antlers of the Knights of the Hart, in red. He wears a gold belt at his waist, with a dag­ ger. About his neck is a gold chain with an emblem of a crown and crescent moon; on his left hand is a gold ring with a similar device. His shield rests under his feet. The coffin's occupant is Prince Throm­ mel, Grand Marshall of Furyondy, Provost of Veluna, a Paladin Lord. He lies in stasis, a powerful illusion causing him to appear as a vampire. His gold belt is worth 50 gp; the dagger thereon is a dagger + 21 + 3 vs. large opponents. His neckchain with amulet is worth 2,00 gp, the matching ring worth 250 gp. If taken from the chamber, Thrommel awakens, but is groggy for 1-4 turns, uncer­ tain about his identity and past. He regains all his faculties thereafter, becoming cau­ tious, circumspect, and taciturn. If the broadsword Fragarach is in sight, he simply speaks-and it comes to his hand. If it was left behind, he is not aware of its location, but asks if he was wearing one when found, or whether one was nearby. In any event, he asks to be accompanied to the surface; once there, he asks for a horse, claiming urgent business elsewhere. If any one character is exceptionally good to him, he gives that person his medallion, as a gift. Anyone more than normally polite and helpful to him receives his ring. Thrommel then rides off. 86 All of Thrommel's rescuers are later sought out by a strong party of humans and elves(including clerics, magic-users, fight­ ers, and men-at-arms) some 5-8 week later. These persons ask the characters to accom­ pany them to Mitrik, chief city of Veluna, where Thrommel is pledging himself to her Noble Ladyship Jolene of Veluna. At this ceremony, each character is knighted (if a fighter) or made an elder of the land (for all other classes). Each is entitled to wear the silver star badge of Veluna and the gold crown badge of Furyondy. In addition, each receives a potion of extra-healing, a ring of protection + 1, and 2,000 pp. The most helpful character (given Thrommel's medal­ lion) is also granted one of the following, as applicable to the class: a book of 12 first level Magic-User spells, a necklace of prayer beads, a shield + 1, or a bag of holding (50 pound capacity). The second most helpful rescuer (holder of the ring) receives a war­ horse appropriate to the class. If any char­ acter recovered the broadsword Fragarach and was gladly willing to allow or help Thrommel to regain it, that person receives the broadsword Scather (also detailed in Appendix C) from Prince Thrommel. All rescuers are also honored by those who rule Furyondy and Veluna. 335. SECRET PASSAGE This area may be approached either from the secret trap door above (area 313) or the escape tunnel from outer works (area 4 of the Broken Tower). To run the following encounters properly, you must be familiar with all the details of this lair and the occu­ pants of areas 336 and 337. Review the notes before starting. The occupants should be played with inteligence; they should be very dangerous. The secret passage leads into a 20' x 30' room where you are horrified-perhaps petrified-to se a huge pale green basi­ lisk gazing at you. The lead character must make a saving throw vs. petrification. Almost simultane­ ously, a runnel of flame appears; read from the passage below. The basilisk is illusory; if disbelief is attempted and the saving throw made, it is seen as such, and this fact can be communicated to others, making them immune to the effect. If the saving throw is failed, the victim is petrified, despite the 0R.iGiirn.L ADVEilTV'S REiilCAR.._IlATED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEilTAL EVIL illusory nature of the beast. The basilisk gazes at one victim per round. A runnel of flame begins from the east­ ern portion of the chamber and spreads rapidly from the center, going both north and south. The moving flame creates a line of brightness along the east and west walls of the place, and then sends fiery streams into a pair of large cressets just at the comers where the north and south passages enter the basilisk's lair. The cressets spring into leaping flames, illu­ minating the whole area. An unseen servant was commanded to empty a container of volatile oil into a slop­ ing trough, highest above a wall fountain and basin on the east wall. Another unseen servant strikes a light to cause the oil to flame, and gravity does the rest. If any sig­ nificant amount of noise is produced by the party at this time, the occupants of areas 336 and 337 are alerted. If the party is abso­ lutely quiet, those occupants might (10%) be warned; if nearly quiet, use 30% .  The local inhabitants work together to insure their very lives. 336. NORTH ROOM Herein dwells Smigmal Redhand, a half­ orc Fighter/ Assassin. She is the leman of Falrinth (in area 337) and leader of the band of brigands in the outer ruins (Tower). Upon hearing noise in the basilisk area, she dons her ring of spel storing (of five invisibility spells) and carefully opens the door a crack to see what is happening. If opportunity presents itself, she uses one of the ring's charges, creeps out and tries to assassinate the most powerful-appearing of the intruders, attacking from behind the victim. Smigmal is disguised as an elf, and if cap­ tured when appearing (due to her attack) will try to dupe the party into believing that she is charmed or otherwise forced to attack, believing intruders to be nasty invaders. If this also seems to fail, she tries to use invisibility to escape, climbs a wall, and hides in overhead shadows. Smigmal Redhand: AC 4 (leather + 1) & shield + 2), MV 12 w, Level 717 Fighter/ Assassin, hp 41, XP 4924 S 17 I lS W 7 D 16 Co 17 Ch 14 #AT 3/2, D 3-8, SA poison on sword (insinuative type B, + 3 bonus to saving throw, Dmg 2S in 2 rounds), SD ring of invisibility; Thief Abilities: PP 4S, OL 52, F/RT 45, MS 40, HS 31, HN 2S, CW 9S, RL lS Smigmal wears leather armor + 1, uses a shield + 2, and wields a shortsword + 1 in normal combat (or a non-glowing normal shortsword in assassination attempts). She is thoroughly evil, and loves her work. She hungers for power to make humans suffer, and hates her human ancestry. She sees Falrinth as her tool, the one who will best aid her in gaining her power. She will fight to protect Falrinth if such action appears worthwhile, but will certainly try to save herself from certain death. Smigmal wears two earrings (each worth 400 gp) and a jew­ eled belt (3,200 gp), and carries 7 gp and 12 ep in a purse. She knows how most crea­ tures react favorably to bloodstones, and has been trading for and accumulating such for future purposes (see chest, below). This plainly furnished 20 ' square room is obviously the residence of someone interested in weapons of unusual sorts. Hanging on the wall are a man-catcher and several sorts of punching daggers (sprouting from metal gauntlets, double­ bladed with sharkskin crossgrip, and others). Here are wavy-bladed knives, double-pointed knives, center-hilted knives, fakhions, and a semicircle of seven matched throwing knives around a buckler with a wicked center spike. Barbed javelins, a short spear with a very broad leaf-shaped blade (capable of dealing an axe-like blow), an array of maces with oddly shaped heads (a wolf with an open mouth, a clenched dracon­ ian forepaw, and others) are also here. A light crossbow with a double track, for firing a pair of bolts simultaneously, hangs on one wall. Furnishings include a narrow cot, a small stand, a table, two chairs, a bench, a stool, a bucket with lid, a wardrobe, and a heavy chest with iron hasp and padlock. Dishes and food­ stuffs are on the table and on a nearby shelf. Several bottles are also on the shelf. No weapons here are magical. The cross­ bow has only half normal range, but a single "to hit" roll is made for both bolts. It loads as if a heavy crossbow. Details on the garrot, mancatcher, spiked buckler, and fakhion sword can be found in 87 the AD&D® UNEARTHED ARCANA book. Details of other new weapons can be extrapolated from existing similar types. The wardrobe holds normal clothing of various sorts (merchant's, laborer's, and others). The chest contains more such gar­ ments, garrots, a vial of acid (standard 8 ounces, D 2-8 as a hurled missile), a potion of polymorphing, and a leather case of six small bottles-four of ingestive poisons (types A, B, C, D) and two of insinuative (types B and C). The chest has a false top; its catch is protected by a needle trap coated with insinuative poison type D (save or die). In the secret compartment are 30 gems worth SO gp each (26 bloodstones and four zircons), two pieces of jewelry (base value 1,000-4,00 gp each), and a belt with hidden pockets (containing SO pp). 337. SOUTH ROOM Falrinth, an 8th level magic-user, lives here with Kriitch, his familiar (a quasit). He functions as 9th level while Kriitch remains within one mile. Falrinth is very evil and power-mad. When he becomes aware of intruders, he has Kriitch investigate in giant centipede form. It can travel by way of a small twisting aperture in the wall, and Falrinth can telepathically use its senses, viewing the intruders' actions from a dis­ tance while keeping the centipede (quasit) well hidden. He can then select an appropri­ ate course of action (hit-and-run, offensive, defensive, or whatever) based on the intruders' powers. While Kriitch remains within 10 feet of Falrinth, each has 2S% Magic Resistance and regenerates 1 hp per round. If Kriitch is slain, Falrinth immedi­ ately drops to Level 4 (retaining only five spells-three of first level, two of second) and flees.

Typical offensive strategy: Cast minor globe and mirror image on self, ready hold, to be followed by charm and then Tasha's or burning hands. Typical defensive strategies: Jump to escape a tight spot. Darkness and/ or invisibility to allow retreat to area 337, with hold portal on the door; continuing to area 338 by the secret door, blocking the passage by wall of Force (placed just inside the room to block even the finding of the secret door) and gathering prized items. If on the verge of discovery, Falrinth will dimension door to one of two passages­ either the corridor east of area 313, or the secret passage to the Tower or outside exit. Falrinth does not dare to remain in the Tem­ ple after defeat; he has too many enemies. He plans to use Smigmal as a tool to achieve control of the remaining Temple forces, so he can become ruler of a domain of death and destruction equalling, even surpassing, that of luz (Ambitious, indeed!). Kriitch is a gift from the demoness Lolth, who is happy to have catspaws in Zuggtmoy's territory (for obvious reasons). Falrinth has devised the traps and fake lair (337a) to fool intruders who are too powerful to defeat offensively. He wears bracers of defense AC 6, and carries a purse containing nine gems worth a total of 1,350 gp (two moss agates, two white pearls, three hematites, a sap­ phire and a tourmaline). This room is obviously the chamber of a magic-user. A thaumaturgic triangle stands at the threshold. The shelving which girdles the place is filled with all sorts of stuffed and mummified animals and such. A cloak with strange runes hangs near the east door. A large bed is here, with a small cabinet, a stool, a writing table with an oddly branched candle holder, a brazier, and a pair of hanging lamps near the bed. A wall cres- set is in the southeast corner, opposite the bed. A rush mat covers the plain floor. A parchment with runes hangs on the east wall, by a door; another, on the south wall opposite the entrance, seems to be a map of the dungeon level. The south parchment is trapped with explosive runes, only detectable by thieves or magic-users (the former having a mere 5% chance, the latter 5% per level). If read by anyone but Falrinth or Smigmal (or oth­ ers they instruct), the runes detonate, inflicting 12-30 points of fire damage (6d4 + 6) to the reader (no saving throw) and to each creature within 10 feet (save vs. spells for half damage). The explosion destroys the map. The runes can only be removed by a dispel magic spell. The map shows no secret doors or secret passages, but reveals everything else in this area and areas 301-320, including residents. It does not show areas 321-334 (those accessed by the the doors in area 306, except the southernmost). The parchment on the east wall seems to be a dire warning not to touch the east door. If read, the warning also contains another set of explosive runes (see above for details). The east door leads, of course, to area 337a. The cabinet con­ tains clothing and several books, unremark­ able works of history and botany. The odd candle holder is an ancient work in elec­ trum, worth 1,500 gp. The southeast wall cresset operates the secret door. 337a. EAST ROOM The door to the east opens into a 10 ' square workroom. Inside are a few bot­ tles containing various spell compo­ nents, a bench, six staves of various woods, and six metal, bone, and ivory rods. A shelf holds nine wands. Here is also a brass chest, protected by a lock, iron binding, and hasp with large pad­ lock. The spell components are only common sorts in small quantities-phosphorus, sul­ fur, a lodestone, etc. Each of the wands has been treated with Nystul's magic aura and thus seems valuable. Three potions are on the shelf-diminution, healing, and delu­ sion of treasure finding. The chest is rigged so that a cloud of chlo­ rine gas erupts when it is opened; each crea- 88 ture within 5 feet must make a saving throw vs. poison, with a + 3 bonus, or die. The cloud appears however carefully the chest is opened, and this trap cannot be removed. The chest contains books filled with written gibberish and a papyrus scroll of similar content; these items dissolve in the gas cloud. The remnants seem to be those of spell books and a magical scroll. 338. HIDDEN ROOM This 10' x 30' room is certainly where the magic-user inhabiting the room to the north actually studied his works. Here are all manner of magical appa­ ratus. To the north, a workbench runs about 15 feet along the wall near the door. The wall here is lined in shelves, with all sorts of bins and containers. Over a small fireplace hang several ket­ tles; a brazier, furnace, and bellows are nearby. Along the south wall is a high writing desk, flanked by a pair of book­ stands, each with an unopened tome. At the far end of the room are a table, high-backed chair, and an open cabinet. Upon the table are a green cup, an iron box, a scattering of gems, several potion bottles, and a leather case. The cabinet holds three iron coffers, a crystal ball, a tall pointed black hat, a box of reddish wood, a long brass wand, five large books, and a small ceramic statuette. Falrinth may still be here when characters arrive; if so, he is hiding in the east end of the room, ready to leave (by dimension door) if his discovery is imminent or obvi­ ous. The cabinet also holds three ivory scroll tubes unless Falrinth has taken them. The volumes on the bookstands are bound in leather and bronze, and are magi­ cal. The westernmost is a tome of leadership and influence; the eastern, a vacuous gri­ moire. (Falrinth was afraid to open either one). The bins and containers hold various spell components (taken from the lab, area 330), worth 6,00 gp (900 gp volume). The cup on the table is jade, worth lClO gp. Falrinth may have taken two gems (a fire opal and star ruby, each worth 1,000 gp). Nine other gems remain-a tiger eye, moss agate, amber, amethyst, jasper, white pearl, pink pearl, topaz, and zircon (the first two worth 10 gp each, the topaz 500 gp, and each of the others 100 gp). Falrinth may have taken a potion of speed 0NGiIIAL A.DVEIITV'S REiIICAR._IIATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EIITA.L EVIL \ - - 0NGi IIAL ADVEIITVRJ:S REiIICAR._IIATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEllTAL EVIL from this table; other remaining are potions of ESP, flying, and sweet water. The leather case holds a wand of a wonder with 50 charges. The iron box on the table contains the Orb of Golden Death. The Orb is a gold sphere shaped to resemble a human skull without its lower jaw. It radiates evil so strongly that Paladins and Good clerics are unable even to touch it (or even the box). Anyone grasping the device gains certain magical powers, and instantly knows how to summon them forth from the Orb: detect lie, know alignment, and poison. These powers may be used without limit as long as the Orb is held. The holder can also cause the great throne in area 10 (of the Upper Temple) to raise and lower. The user's Cha­ risma is affected, and other unique details apply; see Appendix C for more details. The three iron coffers in the cabinet con­ tain 107 pp, 310 gO, and 228 ep, respec­ tively. The crystal is a crystal hypnosis ball attuned to Zuggtmoy. The pointed hat bears cryptic runes; it has no cash value, but is easily recognized by all of Falrinth's associ­ ates, and others throughout the dungeon. The ceramic statue is of a frog alone, if Falrinth has gathered his items. Intact, it represents a frog eating an insect, the latter being an ebony fly. The reddish wood box is an unfolding shrine, inlaid with gold, with a black inte­ rior upon which is inlaid a silver spiderweb, mother-of-pearl stars, and a garnet orb. As the doors of the shrine unfold, an ebony statuette of Lolth rises from a cavity in the base to stand before the web. This icon is worth 6,000 gp, but should be destroyed by Good characters. Part of the back of the cabinet radiates magic, but the magical mirror contained therein can only be obtained by use of the brass rod. The tip of this wand-thick object is oddly notched, and may be used to open the side of the cabinet, allowing the mirror of mental prowess contained therein to slide out for use. Without this key, the mirror will be destroyed in any attempt to remove it, whatever care is taken. The five large books are bound in strange leather, clasped with iron, and locked . These are Falrinth's spell books, their contents listed below. Each of the three scroll tubes in the cabi­ net (missing if Falrinth has escaped with them) contains a scroll of seven spells. This is a selection from Falrinth's spellbooks, which he can use to start new ones if neces- sary. The spells on these scrolls are noted with asterisks hereafter. Book 1 :  affect normal fires, *burning hands, *charm person, compre­ hend languages, dancing lights, *detect magic, enlarge, hold por­ tal, jump, message, Nystul's magic aura, push, *read magic, unseen servant, ventriloquism, *write Book 2: continual light, *darkness 15' radius, ESP, fools gold, forget, *irritation, *levitate, *mirror image, rope trick, Tasha's uncon­ trollable hideous laughter, *wiz­ ard lock Book 3: clairaudience, flame arrow, *hold person, *invisibility 10' radius, *lightning bolt, *protection From evil 10' radius, *tongues, water breathing Book 4: *dimension door, •extension I, *fire trap, *minor globe of invul­ nerability, *monster summoning II, wizard eye Book 5: contact other plane, •wall of force THE INTERDICTED PRISON OF ZUGGTMOY Note that the methods of arriving in this area are limited. Be sure you are familiar with all of these means, as well as the vari­ ous statistics on Zuggtmoy (imprisoned and Freed) before allowing any character to enter this area. 339. HALL OF ELEMENTAL MAGIC This huge echoing hall is constructed of polished black stones, which give back odd reflections of your light. The most striking features here are the symbols set into the chamber floor. To the north is a triangle of dull ecru stone, outlined with some sort of gray metal; a throbbing radiance seems to spread in dun-colored pulses that wash over the area. To the east is a great 10 ' square of translucent stone, blue at the edges and shading to a deep green at the 90 center, bordered by a strip of pale green; the whole gives out undulating sheets of blue-green light. To the south is a circle of translucent crystal ringed by a silvery band; the whole sends forth slowly rising clouds of pale light, that spread and dis­ appear. To the west is a long diamond shape with four points radiating from the sides of the lozenge. The whole is fash­ ioned of translucent stone mottled red and amber, outlined in red gold. It sends up sudden tongues of brightness, planes of pale fiery light that vanish as quickly as they appear. All of these radiations gleam from the walls and floor of the hall. Any object in the center of the four symbols shows the four different illuminations, and the ghastly purple of their mix. If you look upward long enough, occasional glints of light can be seen from the vaulted ceil­ ing, that peaks 60.' or more overhead. The 30 ' wide aisle to the west appears to be the only entrance to the place. Both evil and magic can be found here. The magic radiates from the floor symbols, the evil from everywhere. Any creature who steps into the area of an elemental sym­ bol and stands there for 3 segments is trans­ ported to the corresponding Elemental Node: the Air Cavern (circle), the Earth Burrows (triangle), the Fire Pits (lozenge), or Water Maze (square). The only way to escape therefrom is to win through to another "gate" area or to possess the com­ plete Orb of Golden Death, inset with all four proper gems. Zuggtmoy once used the symbols to visit the Elemental Nodes, and to send screaming sacrificial victims to their dooms in these places. Now, however, the demoness is pre· vented from entering this hall until all four of the sealed portals are broken. If this has been done, she will certainly come here to thank her liberators, in her own way. If Zuggtmoy is destroyed, the symbols lose their magic, and the Elemental Nodes them­ selves wink out of existence, destroying eve­ rything within them at that moment. 340. THE HALL OF DREAD This place is horrible and disgusting, loathsome and fearsome. The stonework seems leprous and mottled. Everywhere are sculpted fungous shapes of night- 0NGi IIAL ADVEIITV S REiIICAR._IIA'fED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELElhEilTAL EVIL mare form and coloration. Each column rising to the roof above writhes and squirms with intertwined fungi. The walls drip with slimes and ooze revolting exudations. The bizarre reds, disgusting yellows, rotten grays and browns, nau­ seous greens, and hideous blues blend in a vertiginous swirl in the center of the northern part of the place, wherein squats a huge sprawling purple throne. This great chair is sculpted to display fungi and human forms, but those depicted are shown crying out in pain as fungi shoot up from their flesh, feed upon their dead and decomposing bodies, or grow rampant in their bony remains. Even the shape of the throne is abominable; its seat is broad and round with a concave surface and four hemi· spherical indentations, two in front, two behind. It has wide arm rests but no back whatsoever. It stands upon a four-tiered dais, the top and 2 '  high steps of which are carved in bas-relief to depict fungi, smut, slimes, molds, jellies, and other horrible growths devouring a compacted mass of living and dead humans. The demoness must have used this area to view captives and servants, the former going to whatever unspeakable fates awaited them, the latter exalting in the fact that no similar prospect awaited them, as long as they served Zuggtmoy well. Projections resembling blighted vege­ tation line the walls, and each gives off a dim but pervasive illumination. Passages and doors are in the east and south walls. Twin valves of bronze in the middle of the south wall accompany twins of gates found elsewhere in the dungeon, com­ plete with bindings and silvery glowing runes. To the west, a 20' broad flight of serpentine steps leads down into a high­ domed chamber, filled with dim but multi-hued light continually changing in color and intensity. The large bronze doors have, of course, a permanent antipathy spell upon them; all those failing any previous saving throw against this effect are unable to approach within ten feet of these doors. They are bound in the standard fashion-chained locked, sealed with soft iron, and bearinǊ the deeply cut sequence of warning runes. The secret door in the southwest corner can­ not be opened from this area except by mag- ical means. Zuggtmoy cannot enter this Audience Hall unless three gates have been sundered: the Grand Entrance (above ground, area 1), Earth Temple (area 145), and Octagonal Chamber (210). 341. PLACE OF EARTH AND GOLDEN CHAINS This 30 ' x 40' chamber is a strange composite of polished pink stone, golden chains, and a floor of loose earth. Deep black earth covers the entire floor, save for a four-foot-wide walkway which edges the room. The bright metal chains hang from the walls, affixed by rings to the walkway as well. The room is dark; the walls show neither cressets nor sconces. Six violet fungi spring up from the center of the earthen area. Each is seven feet tall with four branches of 4 '  length; they alJ move to attack any creature on or near the earthen area. As they do so, a forest of 50 small toadstool-like growths also spring up. These have mock "faces and eyes, which seem to follow their dangerous kin in their attempt to enrich the loam with human flesh. Whenever a fungus strikes a blow, a happy hooting sounds from the cavities pocking the caps of these monstrous specta­ tors. If the violet fungi are all slain, the other fungi all puff forth small spore clouds to a 6 foot range, attacking as 3 Hit Die monsters; a victim hit is blinded for 1-4 rounds (no saving throw). Any blow or kick will destroy one of these lesser fungi, and a bright light (such as light or continual light spell) will shrivel them all in but a single round. Violet Fungi (6): AC 7, MV 1 N' HD 3, hp 24 each, #AT 4, D 0 + rot (save vs. poison or die); XP 231 each (x6) Hooting Fungi (50): automatically hit, MV 0, HD 1/s, hp 1 each, #AT 1, D blindness 1-4 rounds (6 foot range); XP 8 each (x50) If the earthen floor is searched, it is found to be 4 feet deep, damp, loose, and rich. Hidden in the exact center, under the dirt, is an ivory case (1,400 gp value) containing a wand of illumination (44 charges). 91 342. ROOM OF CROWNED SKULLS The plastered walls of this 30' x 20 ' room are decorated with many murals, depicting scenes in which humans, demi­ humans, and humanoids are being robed in finery of various sorts and given crowns of gold, adorned by devices of skulls. Above all are paintings of a goldeA-Skull wearing a silvery crown, in which are set gems of red, blue-green, crystal, and orange-brown. The floor is tiled in black and yellow squares each a foot across. The south wall shows scenes of elemental devastation, and under each · depiction is a chair. Save for cressets, the room is otherwise bare. 343. HALL OF MERRIMENT The plastered walls here show scenes of revelry and debauchery, involving coro­ nated individuals similar to those in the previous chamber. Those rewarded in the antechamber were evidently taken here to be feted. Couches, cushions, and pillows surround small tables. The place is in disorder, as if those once here left hurriedly. Several stands are tipped over, as are chairs; stains on the carpets show where food and drink were spilled and never cleaned. Dishes, ewers, and drink­ ing vessels lie in scattered profusion. All of the furnishings are of excellent work­ manship and materials, but all are dis­ gusting in what they depict. The walls have many cressets, and bronze candela­ bra and hanging lamps are in the cor­ ners. 344. ROOM OF DEMONS This plastered room is decorated with wall murals. All show demons of lesser sorts paying homage to humans of evil mien. Here are also scenes of killing and destruction, obviously showing the deeds which made such homage due. A plain armchair of black wood is centered against the east wall, opposite a 10 ' wide exit to the west. Many bronze cressets line the walls, but no other furniture is here. 0RiGiilAL ADVEn'fv s REinCAR..IlA'fED • THE TEltJ:PLE 0F ELEltJ:EilTAL EVIL 345. HALL OF GLORY The walls of this 20' x 40' room are frescoed. Two suits of plate armor hang from each long wall, north and south; each is of black metal, enameled with strange glyphs in pigments of red, white, green, and brown, surrounding a golden skull. The armor is strangely fluted and spiked; the helmets are wrought to give the wearer a most frightening appear­ ance. Each of the four suits of armor also bears a huge two-handed sword. These four suits of animated armor guard this room, attacking all those who enter. They are immune to all magic, but can be struck by any sort of weapon. They fight mindlessly, until destroyed, to prevent intruders from remaining in or passing through the chamber. They will not enter area 344, but will pursue intruders down the west passageway and all other rooms (areas 346-353) except 340. The golden skull inlaid on each suit of armor is actual gold, worth 50 gp. Four topaz gems are also inset in each suit (each gem worth 500 gp). Suits of Armor (4): AC 3, MV 6 *, HD 9, hp 45 each, #AT 1, D 1-10 (two-handed sword), SD immune to all magic, dam­ aged only by blows (any weapons); XP 2140 each (x4) The frescoes show crowned and robed humans, attended by demons of minor sorts, and slaves bearing rich rewards parading in triumph before a horrible bloated figure upon a throne-like seat. The mottled fungous body-sphere of this crea­ ture is topped by a toadstool-like growth with a face upon it. The body has four ele­ phantine legs, but no visible arms. Seated beside this abomination is an obese male demonic figure (a cambion, in al probabil­ ity), also seated on a throne. 346. CHAMBER, 20' x 30' This plain room is unfurnished, save for a thick carpet on the floor and many empty wall sconces. Its walls are solid stone blocks, closely set and polished. The room has no occupants. This area was the guardroom where demons and the like stood watch when Zuggt­ moy held council. 347. LAVISH CHAMBER This place is decorated in purples and reds: rugs, cushions, upholstered furni­ ture, wall hangings, etc. A large divan, covered in plum silk worked with nause­ ating green and orange figures, domi­ nates the north wall. Behind this couch is a tapestry depicting the spherical crea­ ture with the mushroom neck and head. Before the couch are several stools of cin­ nabar. All of the wood is inlaid with mother-of-pearl, showing demons, fungi, and worse. The wall cressets and sconces are of bright copper, either recently attended or magically kept pol­ ished. Before a throne, a gold bowl con­ tains platinum pieces. The bowl is worth 235 gp. It contains 21 platinum coins, each marked with the face of the demoness, with an evil rune on the obverse. These are tokens, showing that the bearer has the special favor of Zuggtmoy. 348. PURPLE HALL The stones here are of a deep purple color, and all furnishings are of a similar hue: a mauve carpet, lilac and puce wall hangings, even a long table with 12 chairs and a larger one at its head are lac­ quered violet. Bronze candelabra are on the table, and bronze wall sconces are placed at regular intervals. This place was probably a council chamber. The south wall bears a large map of the Fla­ naess, with the Temple at its center. It shows the conquests of the Temple shaded in purple, along with dots of pur­ ple, black, red, green, white, and brown. Some cryptic marks are by each dot, shown by most cities and towns. If read magic is used to examine the map, its writings reveal the identities of individ­ uals in many nations. Each is a secret agent of Chaotic Evil, serving Zuggtmoy, Iuz, and some aspect of Elemental Evil. If this map is taken to the Archcleric of Veluna at Mitrik, he will pay a 10,00 gp reward for the infor­ mation, and those responsible earn the high favor of Veluna. Continue if the door to the east is opened: The walls of the small room to the east 92 bear an assortment of weapons: longbow, quiver of a score of arrows, sword, spear, and sheaf of four javelins. All of the weapons except the bow are sil­ vered; the arrowheads are solid silver. The secret door can only be triggered by insert­ ing an arrowhead into a small opening. 349. PLEASURE CHAMBER This spacious chamber is filled with opu­ lent furnishings: carpets of rich golden hue, nine plush purple chairs, five gren velvet divans, ten cushions of gray watered silk, eight satin ones of deep orange, and six ottomans of shining black leather. Wall murals and tapestries show scenes of debauchery amidst a forest of fungi upon beds of mold and like places. A throne-like golden seat stands in the room's center. One tapestry shows the round-bodied, elephant-legged, fungi-headed bulbous thing seated on the throne chair, amidst a revelry of fungoid forms. All of the furnishings in this death trap are creatures. The carpet is yellow mold; the chairs, violet fungi; the couches, green slime; the ottomans, black puddings; ten pillows are gray oozes, and eight are ochre jellies. Walking on the carpet automatically causes the mold to send forth its poisonous spore clouds, and the touch of warm­ blooded flesh causes any piece of furniture to change to its true form. Zuggtmoy can, of course, relax here and enjoy herself. The throne weighs 400 pounds and is worth 50,000 gp intact. It is so wide, however, that it will not fit into a portable hole or bag of holding. If smashed, the bullion value is only 3,800 gp.

HALL OF SCULPTURE This place is filled with cabinets, lined with shelves, and even the walls have many alcoves and niches. All bear sculp­ tures of ceramic, bone, stone, shell, and other material. These figures depict mushrooms of all sorts-toadstool, fun­ gus, blight, etc. -in all colors, sizes, and shapes. Some dozen or so larger sculp­ tures are made of ivory, inlaid with translucent materials, and stand on the floor, apparently for use as stools by those who wish to rest while viewing the gallery's offerings. The thirteen stools are shriekers, enchanted to appear inanimate. If touched, a stool changes to its actual form and wails loudly; this brings Zuggtmoy if she is able to enter the room, or else alerts her as to the intruders' location. Shriekers (13 stools): AC 7, MV 1 •, HD 3, hp 20 each, #AT 0, SD noise; XP 95 each (x13) If 10 man-turns are spent examining the various sculptures, eight valuable ones are found (worth 200-800 gp each). Four others radiate magic but have no other apparent worth; if thrown down, each changes (per­ manently) into a normal shrieker. 351. EARTH-FLOORED ROOM This place is fashioned of polished brown stone. The ceiling.overhead is U feet high. No cressets are here, nor any other place to put torch or candle. The floor is dirt from wall to wall-a rich dark soil, loosely compacted. The room is otherwise empty. The soil, 6 feet deep, can be thoroughly examined in 30 man-turns, but no treasure is here. This room is where Zuggtmoy once came to sleep, her stem-legs planted in the loam. 352. EAST HALL The polished steps descend some 20 feet into a hall which broadens to a 40 ' width. The floor here is serpentine and porphyry. The walls are of black marble, veined with green and purple. Runes of glowing gray and inky black mark the walls, with glyphs that seem to run and shift into other forms when not viewed directly. Weird light comes from silver­ cupped bronze and copper cressets, spaced at 5' intervals on the walls. Strange flames leap from them, in all the colors of the rainbow-first one hue, then another. The arched ceiling 30' above is apparently sheathed with gleaming silver, reflecting light to the polished walls and floor. Three large pedestals stand 20 feet to the west. Each is 12 feet tall and about 30 inches in diameter, topped with a metal skull seemingly cast as part of the pillar. Each likewise bears strange signs and sigils that shift and change to be unread­ able. The south pillar is electrum; the center, gold; the northern, platinum. The electrum pillar can be estimated (if of solid metal) as being worth 50,00 gp. The gold pillar is worth about 100,00 gp; the platinum, 500,00 gp. 353. GREAT HALL Some 30 feet beyond the odd pillars, the hall broadens to 60 feet width. A huge dais of translucent alabaster commands the west end of the place. Before this stepped platform is a magical device, set in the floor-a hexagon whose two inter- 93 locking equilateral triangles and the cir­ cle that rings them, seem to be made of molten electrum. Tips protruding from the sides of the central hexagon glow dif­ ferent colors; clockwise from the north being red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo. The center of the device pulses a pure purple light. If all four of the sealed bronze gates have been broken, this device will take any and all who step within its purple center to Zug- · gtmoy's own Abyssal Plane. If not, then nothing happens if it is entered. The dais is marked "N on the map. Atop it is a huge throne of silver, set with 666 pre­ cious gems-300 of base value 50 gp; 200 of base value 100 gp; 100 of base value 500 gp; 33 of base value 1,00 gp; and 33 of base value 5,00 gp. Included is every type of precious stone known to man. Each stone is attuned to a demon: a Type I to each of the least value; Type II to those of 100 gp; Type III to those of 500 gp; Type IV to those of 1,00 gp; and babau demons to those of 5,00 gp. Possessors gain demonic attention at a time they least desire it; an exorcise spell can be used to cleanse 20-120 (2d6x10) gems. If all the gems are pried from the throne, Zuggtmoy is freed to return to her home plane (as if all the bronze gates had been sundered), but is imprisoned there for . 66 years, after which she may come forth with all her normal powers. Atop the dais to the west is a huge throne of silver, adorned with hundreds of pre­ cious gems. These are set to form leering demon faces, skulls, fungi, and like pat­ terns; they are of all colors, sizes, and shapes. Behind this seat is a huge tapes­ try of deep purple, worked in red, green, ochre, and white to show various fungi. You find it difficult to see details of the throne or the tapestry behind, for the west end of the room is dim and shrouded in a black mist . As you approach, you see a small, fat old crone seated on the throne, almost lost in the huge seat. She cringes and shrieks when you approach, crying out "You won't get my treasure!'' With that, she fumbles with the arm of the chair, and her voice suddenly booms out "You may take my pillar of electrum. Begone!" If intruders attempt to move the pillar, it 0RJGiilAL A.DVEilTVIQ:S REi ilCARJIATED • THE TElhPLE 0F ELElb:EllTA.L EVI L rises easily (as if a mere staff), and can be carried by a single person. However, if it comes within 60 feet of the bronze gates in area 340, the pillar suddenly leaps from the grasp, smashes the gates, and crumbles to dust! If this occurs or if the offer is not accepted, the hag (Zuggtmoy) offers the gold column next. Whether refused or accepted, the platinum pillar is offered last. The first (electrum) pillar is enchanted only to break the gates in room 340, and crumbles to dust after doing so (worth noth­ ing). The gold pillar breaks those doors and continues upwards, passes corridor areas 227 and 9, enters the octagonal room (210), and sunders the gates therein, crumbling at that time. The platinum pillar can, if used alone, sunder both gates as the gold, and the gates of area 145 as well. If the three pillars are each accepted and then used to sunder gates, the first breaks only the lowest gate, the gold breaks only the gate in area 210, and the last breaks not only that in area 145 but continues unabated to crush the portal at the Grand Entrance (area 1). Thus, only if all three offers are accepted can the pillars free Zuggtmoy completely. If all three offers are rejected, continue with the following. The crone desperately fumbles with the arms of the throne once again. First an olive ray springs forth, eating a small hole in the floor; then one of maroon hue appears, disintegrating some of the metal sheathing in the ceiling. A prismatic sphere of odd colors then springs up, as even more rays of green and red shoot forth. These beams bounce around inside the sphere, causing swirls of radi­ ance and sparks. Hideous shrieks come from the figure bathed in the rays-and the hapless crone is blasted, and turns into a fine gray ash! This is an illusion, of course. The crone, Zuggtmoy, has slipped invisibly behind the tapestry to se what the intruders will do. Part of the magic which binds the place involves greed. When and if Zuggtmoy is freed (whether by the taking of the pillars, which is still possible at this time, or by the prying of gems from the throne), she can take all the treasures from this place (includ­ ing those secreted in the niche in area B) to her own plane, which she will certainly do if remaining in the Temple seems dangerous. If any character tries to explore behind the curtained alcove to the west where Zug­ gtmoy hides, she sends out a wave of fear; each victim within 15 feet must make a sav­ ing throw vs. spells or shrink back. She hopes to encourage intruders to take the throne's gems. If the party leaves before prying them loose, she assumes her normal form and moves to attack physically. Zuggtmoy (still fully bound): AC 0 (body) or -2 (head), MV 6" (walls or ceilings), 12 • (if in crone form), 15 • (normal form), HD 49, hp 222, #AT 2 + 2 or 2, D 2-8 each or 2-12 each, SA at will -fear 15' radius, improved invisibility, pro­ grammed illusion, silence 15' radius, crushing damage or stun (see below), SD regenerates 1 hp per round (2 hp per round if standing in loose soil); XP 28,770 (if still fully bound) Zuggtmoy may use either of two strategic ploys in hand-to-hand combat. The first is engaging with four pseudopods a maximum of two against a single opponent. A single hit inflicts 2-8 points of damage, but if two succeed in the same round, each inflicts an additional 5-8 points of crushing damage (for a total for both hits, of 14-32 points, or 6d4 + 8). She may instead choose to trample one opponent if that individual is prone or under 4 feet in height. Trampling consists of two attacks, each inflicting 2-12 points; if both hit, the victim is stunned for 1-4 rounds. If one or more gates are sundered, Zuggtmoy gains additional powers (usable at will, to a maximum of one per round), as follows. Effects are cumulative, of course. No gates broken: as above; XP 28,770 One gate broken: continual darkness, pollute food & drink; revised XP 31,370 Two gates broken: detect good, detect magic, levitate, read languages, read magic, tongues; revised XP 33,970 Three gates broken: polymorph self, tele­ kinesis (up to 10,000 gp), gate (as normal; see description of gates), and limited wish once per day; revised XP 36,970 Four gates broken: All other powers (see description of gates); full XP 45,170 If the lowest gate (340) is sundered, Zug­ gtmoy is no longer imprisoned in area 353 (A and B), but is freed to roam the entire north dungeon (areas 339-353). If the gates at the top of the stairs (area 210) are also broken, she is free to roam dungeon levels two and three. If the upper gate (area 145) is 94 opened, she is free to roam dungeon levels one and four as well; and if the outer gate (area 1) is also broken, Zuggtmoy is com­ pletely freed. If characters do manage to slay Zuggtmoy, remember that the four ele­ mental symbols in area 339 vanish, and the Elemental Nodes collapse as well. Charac­ ters may then investigate the corridor­ akove west of the Great Hall. If Zuggtmoy surrenders to save her life, she will get out her treasures and exchange them for safety. Beyond the tapestry behind the throne is a corridor 80' long and 10' wide. It is unlit and has no furnishings. A recess in the west wall forms a shelf about two feet deep and ten feet long, the niche being about four feet tall. On the shelf are only four dusty stones. If all four stones are moved simultane­ ously, the rear wall of the niche slides upward to reveal the treasures. However, if the stones are moved singly or in some com­ bination other than all at once, the follow­ ing effects occur (keyed per stone): 1. Blade scythes downwards, cutting off any body part thrust over the shelf (no saving throw) 2. Poisoned darts shoot outward 15 feet; before the shelf area is hit by 1-4 darts, each inflicting 1-4 points of damage and requiring a saving throw vs. poison to avoid death in 1-4 rounds. 3. Nothing happens for 1 round; then a lightning bolt streaks the length of the corridor, for 60 points of damage (save vs. spells for half damage) 4. A jet of green slime erupts from the back of the shelf area, spraying an area 20' long; each victim in the area must make a saving throw vs. poison or be covered. In the secret niche are the following items: wand of fire (72 charges), rod of smiting (41 charges), ring of feather falling, Daern's Instant Fortres, a scroll case containing a scroll of five magic-user spells (monster sum­ moning I, death spell, repulsion, maze, sym­ bol of discorcl), and a box containing eight potions (animal control, dimbing, flying, healing, invulnerability, philter of persuasive­ nes, polymorph self, super-heroism). (The first potion affects mammals, marsupials, and avians.) 0RjGiilAL ADVEil'fV S REi ilCARJIA'fED • THE TETu:PLE 0F ELETu:EllTAL EVIL DUNGEON LEVEL FOUR The Great Temple of area 419 i s  the central command headquarters of all current opera­ tions of the Temple of Elemental Evil. Recruiting drives, raids, temporary and long-term plans - all are the products of the leaders herein. The masterminds of the Greater Temple maintain some degree of contact with Zug­ gtmoy herself by way of a special magical area deep within the compound (area 435). Iuz, however, is seen in person on occasion, as he visits here to gather information and to offer advice. The Temple personnel are respectful of both Iuz and Zuggtmoy in a practical sense rather than one of awe, see­ ing the Two as great leaders and com­ manders rather than dwelling on their true aspects of demoness and demigod. It is only by Iuz' influence and occasional instructions that the humans herein keep some small measure of order amongst their unpredicta­ ble minions. Zuggtmoy's current location is not known to any of the Temple personnel, nor to Iuz. They are all aware of her imprisoned state, but do not know where that prison may be. Iuz suspects the true location (dungeon areas 340-353), but has been unable to penetrate it, nor have his fol­ lowers. But none have pressed the matter with great diligence, for several reasons. Iuz is satisfied with matters as they stand, at least for the moment; he is doing a few things with which Zuggtmoy's presence might have interfered. Zuggtmoy is known to be alive and well, as gleaned from her communications with those in the Greater Temple, so nothing is to fear from that quar­ ter. And finally, a being more powerful than Iuz - the lesser god St. Cuthbert Himself - has been involved from the beginning, and it seems best to postpdne the inevitable con­ frontation with that august personage for a time. Thus, Zuggtmoy's prison will not be · sundered by the efforts of her allies and fol­ lowers. Zuggtmoy's splendid Greater Temple and Iuz' chamber north of it (area 433) are important features of the dungeon level, but others are even more critical. Eight long cor­ ridors stretch from the sides of the Temple, each a color corresponding to one of the four elements. These corridors lead to per­ manent magical gates, each marked by a corresponding shape already seen in the upper dungeon levels - a circle for air, tri­ angle for earth, square for water, and the eight-pointed fire symbol. Two gates exist for each such symbol, however. One of each pair leads directly to the corresponding Ele­ mental Plane; the other leads to a nearby partial plane, called a Node. The Nodes are detailed in section 4 of this adventure. The elemental nodes form the basis for the whole evil operation. They are as caul­ drons, used to mix evil and elemental forces in an unholy recipe concocted by Zuggtmoy and Iuz over a decade ago. Within the nodes are special creatures, to be used as future troops and specialists. The nodes and the Orb of Golden Death (see Appendix 0) were created together, and are directly and magically linked. The powers of this artifact come from the nodes; if the Orb is destroyed, the nodes are likewise (and vice versa, though destroying a plane of exist­ ence is a far greater task). CHARACTER ACTIONS This dungeon level is a dangerous place even for higher level characters. Cautious PCs will explore quietly and carefully, and should quickly realize the dangers herein. If they take appropriate measures, such as dis­ guise (preferably magical, polymorphing being quite convenient), they might be able to infiltrate, misdirect, encourage chaos, and generally turn the place into a shambles without suffering too much damage. On the other hand, direct frontal attack is nearly suicidal. If necessary, an overzealous party might be surprised, captured, and simply ejected as soon as they reach the intersection between areas 402 and 409. If the party has been ravaging the upper dungeon levels, those herein will be on alert status (see Troops & Sentries below), main­ taining exact guard positions and ready for trouble. If characters have allowed any vic­ tims or witnesses to escape, a fairly good description of them will have reached this area, and retribution will be as swift and cruel as possible. On the other hand, if PCs have carefully explored the dungeons in such a way as to slay few and escape with maximum gains, they will probably not have this reputation. The forces of the Greater Temple may be relatively unpre­ pared, and if the PCs are taken, they might be thrown to the Nodes rather than extermi­ nated. If player characters venture into the nodes on their own accord, without first obtaining the Orb from its current custodi­ ans (see area 338), they may suffer further 95 defeat and even entrapment therein. If they have not received the special poem-due (described at the introductory notes to Dungeon Level One), review that informa­ tion and select a method for introducing it. If players ignore the fairly explicit instruc­ tions in the poem, or do not leave the dungeon setting for respite, they will proba­ bly blunder into the nodes unprepared. Do what you can to channel them back to the dungeon (by means as detailed in the pref­ ace to the nodes), so they may obtain another chance at complete success. IUZ AND ST. CUTHBERT PC or NPC actions herein may result in the appearance of the demigod luz, the lesser god St. Cuthbert, or both. Should Iuz be attracted or summoned (either by the direct actions of local residents or by PC errors), Cuthbert will probably (90% chance) arrive as well in 2-9 segments; if not, the PCs are surely doomed. Cuthbert will not appear unless luz does so first. Zuggtmoy's freedom or lack of it does not affect Cuthbert's actions in any case. If St. Cuthbert does appear, he and Iuz will vanish together in a puff of smoke and thunderclap, as they will not discuss or set­ tle their differences in the presence of their followers or other mortals. Before their departure, however, Iuz will first restore his troops with a gesture, and his ancient enemy will do the same immediately there­ after. This has the effect of animating all slain evil troops wearing the symbol of luz (i.e. the Temple guards), restoring them somewhat as monster zombies. Leaders wearing the golden skull are also revived, but as if raise dead and heal were applied. Slain .PCs are similarly revived by St. Cuthbert, being raised and healed either to 20% of normal hit points or, if the PC is a follower of the deity, with a full heal (curing all but 1-4 hp). TROOPS AND SENTRIES The troops of the Temple include the rank­ and-file bugbears and ogres, led by hill giants and ettins, all commanded by human clerics and magic-users. The troops are used for nearly any sort of task anywhere in or near the Temple and its dungeons, being a powerful strike force capable of well­ coordinated attacks under their human strategists. The Temple guards, who stay 0IUGiITAL ADVEITTV S REiITCA1'.IlATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EITTAL EVIL here at all times, are a horde of gargoyles and trolls, offering either aerial or ground attacks (or both) against intruders, and hav­ ing good resistance and stamina. Guards are often supplemented or reinforced by troops. Nearly all of the Temple's regular forces wear distinctive garb, even though armor or clothing may not be typical of the race. Only the gargoyles wear none. For ceremo­ nial occasions, the entire force is attired suitably, in a color matching one of the four elemental forces. However, more protective garb is the rule at most times. Armor is either black leather or blacking on metal, with similar shield if one is used. Both shield and armor are decorated, the latter typically high on the back. The designs employed vary by troop rank. Regular troops (bug­ bears and ogres) wear Zuggtmoy's Eye of Fire, the symbol first encountered in the ruins by Hommlet. The guards (trolls, giants, and ettins) and the bugbear and ogre chieftains wear the ensign of luz - the grin­ ning red horned skull so common to the guards on Dungeon Level Two. The clerics and magic-users wear the emblem of the Orb of Golden Death, a golden skull with­ out a lower jaw but with a jeweled crown. The positions of the residents will depend on the relative status of the area. If PCs have recently been raiding the upper dungeon levels heavily (i.e. if half or more of the monsters therein have been slain), the Greater Temple will be on special alert for intruders. A lighter guard schedule is used otherwise. The resulting positions are as fol­ lows for the hours of 8 AM to midnight. Cut all numbers in half at other times, using one guard to watch a pair of adjacent corridors (420 + 423, 426 + 429) from a position just inside the Temple proper. Human leaders usually keep position behind the main altar (419 A) during alerts, but may be anywhere at other times. A pre­ ferred tactic is to haste most or all of the ogres massed in the Temple while intruders are delayed on the stairs. If the invaders turn off into a barracks area, troops will be quickly moved into position to cut off possi­ ble escape.

TACTICAL NOTES At times other than alerts, the residents wander a bit from their stations, and may be found up to 50 feet away at any time. They may move to engage intruders if such seems appropriate, but will sound an alarm while doing so. When an alarm is thus called, the others will eventually come to take their assigned positions, but this may require as much as 11-20 rounds of preparation and movement. If fighting starts during alert status, those stationed at specific points do not move from those places to engage intruders unless specifically ordered to do so. They contrib­ ute missile fire to melees in the Greater Tem­ ple whenever possible, but will keep their posts and fight to the death. The gargoyles (who actually live in the Temple itself) rove the place in groups of 3- 6, but return to and defend the Temple dur­ ing alerts, meetings, and so forth. Their primary purpose during an alert is to stop all flying intruders. Their secondary task is to enter melees by swooping from the air, as they might thereby gain surprise against opponents already engaged (1-3 on ld6). During alerts, ettins and giants stand in corridors about 10-15 feet from the Greater Temple area, weapons at ready. They con­ tribute to melees in the Temple with thrown boulders, avoiding their comrades if possi­ ble (but often not entirely). Note that three of the ettins have been instructed by the giants in rock-throwing, and have a similar capacity for hurling such, at the faster rate 96 of two per round (ranges 3 "/6 "/12 ", D 2- 16) but with a -4 "to hit" penalty due to min­ imal proficiency. The bugbears by the gates stay out of line­ of-sight from the bulk of the corridor, around a corner if possible, with weapons at ready. Note their surprise ability, and the fact that this could give them several sur­ prise segments of missile fire. RANDOM ENCOUNTERS Roll ldlOO once per turn, and refer to the table below.

PROMENADE This area is normally empty, but is guarded by a pair of trolls (from area 402) during alerts. If present, they stand by the south wall between the stairways, hoping to sur- prise intruders. The descending stairways empty onto a large landing. From there, a passage 20 feet wide and 30 feet tall slopes slightly down­ wards to the north, leading to more stairs, an intersection, more stairs, and more corri­ dor. The walls of the landing are covered with mosaic murals depicting a nauseating scene of frolicking demons, vile goops and molds, and giant humanoids, all capering about amidst a field of their fallen, tom, and tor­ tured victims. This stair seems often used, with fresh and old footprints of large humanoids all about. Small scraps of food and bits of bone lie in the dusty comers of the stairs' risers. In one comer is a small piece of torn parch­ ment, easily found if characters examine the area. Upon it is a faded drawing, its details only discernible when held up to a light source. It is a crude depiction of a crowned skull, with four lines (each about twice the length of the skull's height) emanating from the crown, and a circle at the outer end of each line. 402. EAST WING In this area live four trolls, sentries for the troops of the Great Temple (who lair in areas 405-408) and personal guardians of their commanders (tose in areas 403 and 404). Two will be here at all times, and all are present at night. The trolls' bedding is piled in the north­ east comer of the area, along with 4 small chests. The trolls drag out their bedding at sleeping times, and keep all their valuables in their locked chests; each has a key. Inside each chest are lO cp, 19 sp, 16 ep, 15 gp, and 1-4 gems of pure black tourmaline (worth 500 gp each). One troll also has a figurine, an ebony Ely - which is cursed to become a Chasme (minor demon; see MM2 page 38) after the seventh round of its seventh use. The east wall is covered by a huge tapes­ try which depicts a great battle, apparently between the forces of Good and Evil. Therein, shining humans and winged humanoids are being blasted to the ground by magical rays issuing forth from the eyes of a gigantic, rotund, wrinkled face. The tapestry conceals a normal-sized but stoutly reinforced iron-bound door (to area 403). The trolls have no keys. A corridor about 10 feet wide and 15 feet high slants off to the southeast. 97 Trolls (4): AC 4, MV 12 ", HD 6 + 6, hp 42, 38, 35, 30, #AT 3, D 5-8/5-8/2-12, SD regenerates (3 hp per round starting 3 rounds after being damaged); AL CE, SZ L (9 ' ), XP 861, 829, 805, 765 (525 + 8/hp) 403. STUDY This quiet room is the abode of Barkinar and Deggum, the commanders of the Tem­ ple Troops and Guards (respectively). They are usually elsewhere except at night. Two normal beds stand along the north and south walls, nestled tightly into the western corners. Beside each is a wardrobe and a small table, the latter bearing a crystal ewer and cup (each set worth 250 gp). The east wall of the room is dominated by a great brick fireplace with marble mantle, upon which are various knicknacks col­ lected by the two clerics - shrunken human heads, religious paraphernalia, carved figu­ rines, and other interesting items, with a total value of 3,500 gp (averaging 350 gp per item). Decorative tapestries flank the fireplace on the east wall. The southern conceals an open doorway leading to a neat closet, in which the clothing of the two clerics is kept hanging to either side. A full-length mirror is mounted cin the east closet wall. Four pieces of gold jewelry (each worth 1,00 gp) lie on a small shelf attached to the mirror's left edge. Another identical but empty shelf is at the right edge; if twisted clockwise, it opens the secret door entrance to a corridor to the mages' room (404). Barkinar worked his way up through the ranks over the last six years. He came to the Temple ruins to scavenge treasure, and stayed to serve and earn even greater wealth. Once a lowly cleric of the Earth Temple, he became its leader through a series of treacherous and bloody maneu­ vers. Knowing talent when he saw it, · Supreme Commander Hedrack brought the mature and experienced Barkinar to the lower levels of the dungeons. Barkinar expects, but does not covet, Hedrack's exalted position. He bides his time, working earnestly for the good of Zuggtmoy and the Temple in any way demanded. He is patient, cruel, scheming, and utterly evil - a perfect officer for this milieu. Deggum is a half-elf, a renegade and run­ away from his people in Welkwood. Drawn by rumors of the resurrection of evil might, 0NGiilAL ADVEilTVIQ;S REi ilCARJIATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EllTAL EVIL and by the promises of Lareth (from the Hommlet moathouse ruin) and others like him, Deggum has found success and a fast rise in power through his Temple position. He is personally tutored by Hedrack and Senshock both, and is seen as a great future leader. He carries his spellbook in a pack at all times, and studies his craft in his spare moments. The book contains most of the same first and second level spells as those of his tutur, Senshock. Each cleric carries a black scarab inscribed with the letters TZGY, which is used to control the curtain behind the main altar (419 A). Barkinar owns potions of extra healing and sped, and Deggum owns potions of healing and growth. They will use them as needed to combat invaders.

ROOM, 20' x 30' The door to this room is wizard locked at 9th level of magic use. This is the secluded lair of Senshock, Lord Wizard of the Greater Tem­ ple. He may (40% chance) be here at any time during daylight hours, working on his own projects, or is otherwise busily conferring with clerics, instructing giants, or performing some other administrative task. He always caries his black scarab inscribed with the letters TZGY, for controlling the curtain behind the altar (area 419 A). The room is well-appointed, with tapes­ tries on the walls and furnishings made of ebony and rosewood. The bed stands in the southeast corner, adjacent to a small fire­ place in the east wall. A wardrobe stands at the foot of the bed between it and the door. The north wall is filled by a long work­ bench, with beakers bubbling over small flames, bottles and boxes of various rare substances, and other laboratory parapher­ nalia. On the west wall is an oaken shelf unit, upon which are three large and heavily bound books, a group of twelve pieces of assorted jewelry all bearing a black skull motif, three wooden eggs, and two plati­ num medallions with like chains. Each of the three books on the shelf is a trap, of course, and all of the same type. The books are made of heavy wood, pains­ takingly painted to look real. A book sticks to anyone who touches it, due to a powerful curse (no saving throw). It remains so until a remove curse is applied by a 9th or higher level caster. The jewelry collection is worth 25,00 gp for all, each piece being studded with diamond chips and onyx; the average value of individual pieces is 1,500 gp if the set is sp Ii t. The wooden eggs appear to be nothing more than nicely crafted puzzles in which the pieces are cleverly interlocked, worth 750 gp for the set due to the fine inlay work. In the center of each egg, however, is a crys­ tal miniature of the unholy symbol used hereabouts; each figure is worth 1,00 gp, but should be destroyed by Good charac­ ters. The platinum medallions and chains also bear unholy symbols, but need only be melted down to be properly spoiled, then worth 200 gp for the metal (or 150 gp each for the original medallions). The wardrobe is stoutly made, and has five secret compartments disguised as parts of the ornamental inlay design. A separate check for secret doors is required for each compartment. Each space is a two-inch cube, and the contents are as follows: 1 Six black sapphires, each worth 5,000 gp. 2 One carnelian (worth SO gp) bearing a fire trap (D 10-14). 3 One crumpled black handkerchief, soiled 98 and sticky from use. This portable hole contains Senshock's spell books (see below), a cloak of poisonousness, one large flask of oil bearing a fire trap (D 1(). 14 plus 4-24 from the exploding oil), and 29 potion vials held in six wooden racks. The potions include one of nearly every type listed in the DMG, except for ani· mal, dragon, and human control, delu­ sion, and both oils. Those of giant strength and control are of the hill giant type, of course, those being most accessi· hie for materials. 4 Four jeweled (but non-magical) bracers, each pair worth 2,000-8,00 gp. 5 A tiny pocket mirror of life trapping, which causes the first person looking into it to save vs. spells or be ensnared (as the larger version). If it catches a victim, it simultaneously releases its current occu­ pant (a purple worm, hp 88), as it has only one extra-dimensional space. The exchange will be so rapid, however, as to produce the impression that the victim was polymorphed into the worm . . . . On the workbench are various hairs, liq· uids, and other items obtained from a vari­ ety of monsters (but no dragons), along with powdered gems, quicksilver, and other components. The whole is worth 20,00 gp, plus another 500 gp for exotic glassware and utensils. The lot may be gathered and packed for travel at the rate of 1,00 gp worth per turn per person, assuming proper sacks and padding are available. Senshock is the respected and dreaded emissary of Zuggtmoy herself. Just as Iuz wields power through Hedrack and Barkinar, so do the scales balance through Senshock's actions on Zuggtmoy's behalf. Long ago, as an apprentice in the local wizard's guild, Senshock learned the busi­ ness of potion and wand making, and has brought those talents here. He visits the lab (area 330) on occasion, or sends bugbears or trolls to fetch the necessary items, but per· forms all of his work here, in his private room. Senshock combines his attention to detail with grand strategy planning, and is the actual source of many of the better tactics used by the Temple forces. He has been assured (by Zuggtmoy) of the position of High Commander and General of all the Temple's mighty forces once the reconstruc· tion is complete. luz has been noncommittal about this, so Senshock is trying to gain Iuz' 0NGiIIAL A.DVEII'f'V S REiIICARJIA'f'ED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELEJhEllTA.L EVIL favor in any way possible. The Lord Wizard is a critical part of the defense plan for the Greater Temple, main­ taining a post behind the main altar (419A) and adding his spells where needed in melees. He will not expose himself until or unless invaders are near defeat. Should the Temple guards suffer defeat, he will take his place in the throne room (area 435) to brief Zuggtmoy about the events, and will then teleport out to a well-studied secret retreat in Verbobonc. Senshock is privy to certain secrets of Iuz' , but will never reveal anythins of great import. If captured and examined by ESP or similar means, however, Senshock can pro­ vide one interesting tidbit - Iuz is working against the Scarlet Brotherhood, and seeks both Zuggtmoy (whose location is unknown even to him) and his mother Igwlf (be lieved Jost in the great Abyss) to aid him in this task. If charmed or otherwise magi­ cally coerced to reveal his secrets, Senshock will suddenly and mysteriously die, slain by Iuz himself.

COMMON ROOM This area is the central meeting-place, mess hall, and lounge for the rank-and-file troops of the Great Temple - 12 ogres and 18 bug­ bears. The current inhabitants of the room are found by checking the time of day, as follows. Meals are at 1-3 PM, 6-8 PM, and 1-3 AM. During these periods, the area is busy with 6-9 of each troop type. They take turns eating and then replacing others at their assigned tasks (wherever that may be), so ogres and bugbears are strolling in and out almost continuously. The place is loud and messy. Those in the process of eating are usually also talking, arguing, engaging in minor food fights, and so forth. The ogre shaman (who lairs in area 407) refuses to risk himself in guard duty, and so functions as the cook. He is assisted by four bugbears at all times. Between noon and 4 AM, the shaman/cook is 50% likely to be here, or 40% likely to be in his nearby room, though he may (10%) be wandering in the nearby halls carrying a ladle of chunky fluid, looking for someone to taste his latest creation (which has a 30% chance of causing nausea for 1-4 turns). Though busy at mealtimes, he is otherwise 20% likely to be found dozing. During a one-hour period after each mealtime, one black pudding may (25% chance) be present, eating scraps for the cook (a friend it recognizes) and generally consuming everything else it is permitted. At other times a group of 2-5 bugbears, 1- 4 ogres, or both may be here secretly, trying to talk the cook into making a snack but, through experience with the stubborn sha­ man, expecting scraps at best. Roll ld12; 1 = bugbears, 2 = ogres, 3 = both, 4-12 = no visitors. The bedpiles of four bugbears are in the southeast comer of the room. This group is composed of the most recent losers in the vari­ ous gambling games played by the troops, and have lost their bunk privileges to those in area 408 (a-f). They are thus also drafted as assist­ ants for the cook, and as tasters as well. They have no treasure; they constantly pilfer what­ ever they can, but their belongings are regu­ larly stripped by the others, or eaten by the wandering pudding.

ROOM, 20' x 10' Rooms 406a through 406d are used by the ogre troops of the Great Temple. Each room is 20' x 10' ,  and 15 ' tall. Even if not encountered elsewhere, the ogres will only be found here 30% of the time. The south­ west room (406e), identical to the others, is occupied by the bugbear chieftain and sub­ chief.

ROOM, 40' x 50' Herein lair the ogre chieftain, two leaders, and a shaman. The shaman functions as cook for the troops, as detailed above (area 405). The other three sleep a great deal, go out on an occasional dungeon patrol, or 'supervise' their ogre troops at their posts. In deference to his rank, the ogre chieftain has been given a black scarab which he believes is identical to those used by the human leaders. His, however, is inscribed with the letters TZOY, and will not function as the others. He has never put it to the test.

BARRACKS This area has no doors, being a communal lair of a dozen bugbear troops of the Tem­ ple. Their chief and sub-chief stay in the southwest room by the common (area 406e). Each bugbear has been trained in the longbow, and carries 30 normal arrows in a quiver. Bugbears (12): AC 5, MV 9H, HD 3 + 1  (hp 5-8 per die), #AT 1 or 2, D 2-8 (morning star) or 1-6/1-6 (longbow), SA surprise on 1-3, AL CE, SZ L (7' + ); XP 160 + 4/hp 409. WEST WING In this area live four trolls, sentries for the Guards of the Great Temple (areas 410-415) and personal guardians of their high com­ mander (area 417). Two will be here at all times, and all four during the night. The trolls' bedding is piled in the north­ west comer of the area, along with 4 small chests. The trolls drag out their bedding at sleeping times, and keep all their valuables in their locked chests; each has a key. Inside each chest are 15 cp, 13 sp, lO ep, 19 gp, and 1-4 violet garnets (worth 500 gp each). On the east wall is a huge painted mural depicting a great battle, apparently between the forces of Good and Evil. Therein, shin­ ing humans and winged humanoids are being blasted to the ground by blue bolts issuing forth from the fingers of a tall horned humanoid in wizard's garb. The painting cleverly conceals a normal-sized but stoutly reinforced iron-bound door (to area 416). A corridor about 10 feet wide and 15 feet high slants off to the southwest.

COMMON ROOM The occupants of this area are present only at night. During the day one troll (from area 409) keeps watch at this post, but the room is left deserted during alerts. Herein dwells an ettin, who acts as guard for this west barracks area. One of his two heads suffers from paranoid delusions, and cannot sleep if others are in the room; the ettin is thus forced to reside here, in the common room, rather than in area 415 with the others. This disease does not affect his work or combat ability, however, except to decrease his chance of being surprised to 1 in 10. Due to his misfortune, this ettin has not partaken of the rock-throwing instruction as have his comrades in area 415. The ettin's huge bed stands by the west wall. One long and huge table fills the center of the room, bordered by ten wooden chairs of similar size. A fireplace in the south wall bums merrily. Two corridors exit to the west, and two large doors are in the east wall. Under the ettin's bed is a large, flat, iron box. It contains 1124 cp, 821 sp, 492 gp, one emerald (worth 1,00 gp), and the remain­ ing half of one candle of invocation of Law­ ful Good alignment.

NORTH SIDREROOM Most of the provisions used by those on this dungeon level are kept here and in room 413. The room is filled with crates, barrels, boxes, and the like, but nothing is left unpacked. The containers are filled with dried meats and fruits, clothing, and other items of little value. Behind a half-empty crate near the southeast comer is a secret door, which can only be found if the crate is moved. 412. SECRET ROOM This room contains a few boxes and barrels of provisions, as with the rooms to either side. Hiding in one crate are two prisoners, a half-ore and a human. The ettins took them on a recent raid, but instead of turning them over to the Temple authorities, hid them here for a future snack. The captives have hidden themselves in hope that the ettins will believe them to have escaped. The half-ore is an indignant fighter/thief. He was part of the detachment in area 244 (Dungeon Level Two), but was scavenging alone on level three when picked up by the patrol. If found by characters, he will coop- 100 erate in all ways and beg for release. He will try to atone for his absence from his unit by turning against his rescuers, of course, should any guard units be encountered thereafter. The human, apparently a town mer­ chant, is old, wounded, and weak. This is a ruse, merely being the form of this dopple­ ganger's last victim. It will play its current role as long as needed, but seeks escape from the dungeon. If rescued, it will fer­ vently promise to send a reward, and will fabricate a name, address, friends' names, and other details as needed. It will, of course, vanish utterly upon its release, heading for a more profitable area.

SOUTH SIDREROOM This storeroom contains provisions and nothing else, identical to room 411. 414. LARGE ROOM Four hill giants dwell herein, members of the elite high guard of the Greater Temple. The room is simple and undecorated, about 25 feet tall and 60 feet long. All the furnish­ ings are appropriately giant-sized. Two beds stand by each wall, north and south. The room is warmed and somewhat lit by a fire­ place in the west wall, beside which are piles of small boulders. The wall itself shows signs of digging, and is greatly pitted. (The giants have worked this area for missiles.) Under each bed is a large chest. Each chest contains clothing, food scraps, various mixed coins (about 1,500 gp worth in each, with 250 pound encumbrance), a few gems (1-10 per box, of random value), and souve­ nirs of past kills - scalps, pelts, bones, and the like. In actuality, only three of the giants are as they seem. The fourth is an imposter, actu­ ally being a half-elf spy. The hill giant Scorpp (who is currently living it up in area 318, unless slain by PCs) was replaced here by this character, one Keila by name. Scorpp is thus not missed in the least. 0RjGiIIAL ADVEIITV S REiIICAŕIIATED • THE TE1lPLE 0F ELE1lEilTAL EVIL Keila is a druid, and possesses a valuable item made by her professional ancestors, a phylactery of change. This item enables here to use her innate shapechange ability to assume monster form as well as animal. The possible forms are still limited to monstrous reptile, bird, or mammal, the latter corres­ ponding to the hill giant form. The phylac­ tery does not radiate magic, and Kella carries no other magic items, to avoid expo­ sure by detect magic or other means. Kella cannot cast spells in giant form, and will do nothing to give away her disguise; she speaks only when necessary, and is so immersed in her role that she has become almost giantish in her attitudes. Keila has taken the form and jobs of old Scorpp, spying on the Greater Temple for the leaders of the Old Faith. She fears the current rise in evil power, and knows that time is limited. She also knows that she risks certain horrible death at the hands of Iuz himself should she be discovered, but things have gone well thus far - nearly two months in all. The half-elf can escape nearly any night if desired, but she awaits the arrival of some powerful group that might stand a chance at defeating the evil powers herein. If she notices the PCs sneaking about quietly, she will try to follow them and secretly reveal herself. If thus accepted, she will urge retreat so she can tell them critical things - the numbers and types of monsters herein, the habits of the leaders, which corridors go where, and so forth. If she does not ally with the party beforehand, she will hold back in a large melee, watching to see if the party's resources and courage balance those of the evil horde. If it seems that her powers could swing the balance in favor of the attackers, she will change to her normal half-elven form and aid the party as best she can. If the party is too quickly defeated, she will wait for other challengers. If the party can defeat the evil ones unassisted, she will certainly not risk anything by revealing herself, instead shapechanging to some small avian form to make her escape.

LARGE ROOM This large and undecorated room is nearly identical to area 414. It is the residence of three ettins, and is furnished in appropriate manner. A fireplace in the west wall offers a little light and heat for the occupants. The ettins, of course, are members of the high guard of the Greater Temple, as are the giants next door. These three have received some instruc­ tion in rock-throwing from their giant allies, and are able to hurl two per round (ranges 3"/6 "/12", D 2-16 each) but with a -4 "to hit" penalty due to minimal proficiency. Following advice from the human lead­ ers, the ettins have pooled their treasure, keeping it in the box under one bed (the last one checked by PCs). The other two boxes are also locked, but contain traps. One holds poisonous gas, with effects identical to those of a cloudkil spell (q. v.) in a cloud of 10 foot radius. The other is filled with worthless pebbles and rocks, secured by six poisoned darts aimed so that at least one hit the intruder opening the box, who must save vs. poison at -2 to avoid paralysis (last­ ing 2-5 turns). The ettins' combined treasure chest is locked and trapped with contact poison (save or die), but all the ettins know how to avoid it. One (randomly determined) ettin has the key to the chest. It contains 1,279 cp, 883 sp, 2,010 ep, 1,421 gp, 2 violet garnets (500 gp each) and a ruby (5,00 gp), 2 dia­ mond brooches (worth 2,500 and 3,500 gp), and two nondescript rocks - one a stone of controlling earth elementals, the other a permanent sling stone + 3 (the enchantment upon which does not disappear through use). 101 Ettins (3): AC 3, MV 12 ", HD 10, hp 70, 54, 38, #AT 2, D 2-16/3-18, SA throw rocks (#AT 2, -4 "to hit", ranges 3"/6 "/12", D 2-16 each), SD surprised only on a l; XP 3380, 3156, 2932 (2400 + 14/hp) 416. PLANNING ROOM This room is normally guarded by a troll (from area 409), who stands inside where he will not be seen from the normal entrance. The room is left untended during alerts. Ornate wall hangings and twin fireplaces reveal that this room is often used by those at the highest levels of command. A magnif­ icent oak table fills the center of the room, flanked by a dozen plush chairs, both nor­ mal and giant-sized. On the table are several books (reference works on strategy and tac­ tics, of minimal value), a dozen sheets of parchment bearing unintelligible scribbles, three quills (each in a golden quill-holder worth 50 gp), and two inkwells in a jeweled silver stand (worth 1,800 gp). The north wall is covered with maps of the dungeon levels, nearby towns, and the surrounding countryside. Four rich tapes­ tries (worth 1,500 gp each) adorn the east and west walls, and twin crystal chandeliers (each worth 2,000 gp) hang from the ceiling. A brass candle-rod (525 gp), for lighting the chandeliers, stands in the southwest corner by the fireplace. This planning room is the site of a daily afternoon conference amongst the leaders of the greater Temple, and of a monthly meet­ ing for all the leaders in the dungeon. Except for Hedrack, all visitors enter and leave by the south door and corridor. The emergency exit is rarely used, hidden by a secret door behind one large area map to the northwest; it leads to a one-way secret door in the troll room (area 409). The normal door in the west wall is always locked; it leads to the residence of the high priest Hedrack. 417. PRIVATE ROOM Here dwells Supreme Commander Hedrack, High Priest and Most Honorable Emissary of Iuz Himself. Though he is often elsewhere, his two comely female servants remain in this room at all times. Though only 20 by 30 feet in size, Hedrack's abode is impressive. The floor is covered by thick rugs, one atop the other. The walls are covered by tapestries of ornate geometric designs, involving circles, 0RjGiilAL ADVEilTV S REiilCAR._IlATED • THE TEJhPLE 0F ELElhEllTAL EVIL squares, triangles, and the eight-pointed fire symbol. Two engraved brass braziers shed light and heat from the western comers of the room, and a large fireplace in the east wall adds its radiance. By the latter are brass andirons and matching fireplace tools. Atop a marble man­ telpiece are several knicknacks, and hanging on the wall above them is an excellent paint­ ing. The latter depicts the united forces of the Greater Temple in full battle garb standing before the great altar, with their human lead­ ers before them (Hedrack clearly visible in the center position). Along the north wall are two book­ shelves, one including a desk in its lower portion. A plush chair before the desk is flanked by a small wooden table. The shelves are filled with books of all sizes and colors, most bound in leather. A wooden bed, with carved gargoyle heads on all four posts and piled with silvery furs, stands by the center of the west wall. Upon another small table by the head of the bed are a metal pitcher and a large basin. To the left of the entrance stands a wardrobe, and an ornate unholy symbol hangs on the wall between it and the door. The furniture comprises a matched set of prime sablewood, all decorated by fine mar­ quetry and worth at least 700-1400 gp apiece. (All can be easily disassembled for removal. )  The braziers are worth 300 gp each. The set of brass andirons and fireplace tools is worth 750 gp. Each of the ten rugs is worth 600-1000 gp and weighs 30-33 pounds. Each of the 8 tapestries weighs half that, but is worth 400-1400 gp. Central on the mantel is a four-inch tall ebony carving of a grinning horned skull. This item is magical; if touched, luz imme­ diately ses this room and its current occu­ pants, wherever he may be. He might (25% chance) decide to come to investigate the disturbance, or will probably do so (75% chance) if his name is uttered while the figu­ rine is touched. If possible, Hedrack will use this item to summon Iuz if cornered here in his lair. Other items on the mantel include two ceramic plates, hand-painted but poorly done (by Hedrack, and worthless), a two­ inch tall miniature dragon made of deep red crystal (actually of carved ruby, worth 7,500 gp), four dinner knives with scrim­ shaw handle.> carved with scenes of sea monsters attacking vessels (each knife worth 100 gp), a lavender and green elipsoid stone (identical to an ioun stone but non­ magical, worth 500 gp), and a small chunk of lava in which are embedded several tiny gemstones (5 very rare volcanic tourma­ lines, the whole worth 5,000 gp). The paint­ ing is worth 250 gp. The desk is closed and locked, but the key lies nearby on a shelf, and is easily found by any search. Within the desk are various parchments and record-books, showing the numbers and types of creatures recruited by all the dungeon temples in the last year, troop pay records, disciplinary notes, and the like. In one small volume, details about humans and humanoids are sorted into four sections labeled A, E, F, W - this being a record of sacrifices sent to the nodes. Among those prominently mentioned are Ashrem, Jaer, and Sargen (who now wander the Nodes). In a bottom drawer is a scroll of five spells, recently completed by Hedrack; on it are silence 15' radius, dispel magic, cure critical wounds, flame strike, and slay living. (Hedrack will recover and use this item against intruders if possible.) The bookshelves are crammed with refer­ ence works on various subjects, with an emphasis on battle strategy and tactics, per­ sonal improvement, leadership, and man­ agement. Most appear little-used. Each of the 150 books is worth 1-10 gp. One work, entitled 'Laws of the Temple', is a hollowed­ out cache for 15 gems - 3 amethysts, 6 cit­ rines, 2 diamonds, 3 opals, and a huge black sapphire. (The total value is 22,300 gp, the last item being worth 7,500 gp and the oth­ ers 500, 50, 5,000, and 1,000 gp respec­ tively.) One tome is magical, a book of vile darkness that Hedrack plans to study within the next few months. The four silvery furs on the bed are ermine, each worth 4,00 gp and weighing 10 pounds. The pitcher and basin are a plati­ num alloy, the set worth 500 gp. The unholy symbol on the wall is a spare, inset with sev­ eral paste gems and worth only 50 gp. In the wardrobe are five silk robes, one for each ceremony - brown, black, gray, green, and red. Upon the breast of each is an embroidered symbol of the golden skull, with the horned skull symbol of Iuz on the back. Five matching pairs of slippers lie on the floor of the wardrobe. Also here is a suit of black leather armor and matching face mask, occasionally worn by Hedrack when he tours this and other dungeon levels incognito to gather information. Hedrack's position herein as the Mouth of 102 Iuz (among his other titles) commands the fear and respect of all the troops. A dark glance from him causes even the boldest giant to cringe, in deference to the dire powers at his command as much as his per­ sonal power. He dresses in bejeweled silks, and stalks about with an air of utter confi­ dence. Hedrack wears bracers of defense AC 4 during normal operations, but dons his shining black plate mail + 3 and shield + 3 if trouble is expected (i.e. during alerts). He wears a ring of free action and carries a wand of fear at all times, and often brings his rod of smiting and hammer + 2 as well. A small magic cube and black scarab never leave their black velvet pouch at his belt; the latter controls the curtain behind the main altar (419 A), and the latter is a Daem's instant fortress, used on the infrequent occasions when invaders have posed severe threats. Hedrack's favorite tactic with this device is to block the exit with it, at any con­ venient place in corridors 401 or 418, though he will erect it in the Temple itself if necessary. He mans it with a dozen or more ogres, bugbears, and gargoyles if possible. Hedrack also keeps several potions in his quarters, and selects a few for each jaunt. He commonly carries those of extra healing, flying, and polymorph, and also has potions of climbing, invisibility, and speed. Hedrack makes scrolls as well, and has recently completed one of five spells: silence 15' radius, dispel magic, cure critical wounds, flame strike, and slay living.

PROMENADE From the landing between areas 402 and 409, 20 foot long stairs descend ten feet fur- 0NGiilAL ADVEil'fV S REi ilCA1'_IlATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EllTAL EVIL ther to the grand corridor leading to the Greater Temple itself. The ornate murals on the walls continue their macabre motif, but the further one passes northward, the lower the figures become, until they all appear to vanish into the floor by the time the Temple is reached. This corridor is normally empty, but is guarded by a pair of trolls (from area 402) during alerts. 419. THE GREATER TEMPLE This area is normally guarded by 2 trolls (from areas 402 and 409) and 2-8 gargoyles. Leaders of various races may also be present. During alerts, all the ogres (from areas 406 and 407) and gargoyles (who lair here) will be here, commanded by all the human leaders (areas 403, 404, and 417), who prefer defensive positions behind the altar drape (area 433). Other guards will be stationed at each corridor. (See the Troops & Sentries section of the prefactory notes.) This vast center of evil activity is impres­ sive in its simplicity. The ceiling a full sixty feet overhead appears as if a quiet outdoor night sky, stars gleaming in their constella­ tions. The walls are lined in smooth black marble or onyx, of such fine craftmanship that the joints can barely be detected. Around the sides of the room, eight corri­ dors lead off to the unknown. The walls of each corridor are painted a distinctive color; those to the south (420) are brown, the next (423) gray, then (426) red, and the northern­ most pair (429) green. High on the walls between each two corridors are small flying buttresses - a dozen in all - and upon each, sitting nearly 50 feet above the floor, is the statue of a gargoyle, sitting and scowl­ ing down upon the room's occupants. (Each gargoyle's location is marked with a G on the map.) These are real gargoyles, the aer­ ial defenders of the Greater Temple. They serve the leaders to some extent, but are quite likely to attack without command, should they sight unengaged intruders. Dur­ ing any pitched battle in the Temple itself, however, their favorite tactic is to wait for opportunity and swoop to attack those already engaged, moving swiftly in from the defenders' rear and gaining a 1 in 3 chance of surprise (but only if their target is busy in melee). Thirty feet north of the entrance is a series of broad steps, leading 5 feet upwards to a stone altar (A). Draped across the altar is a sheet of red silk, with the eight-pointed fire symbol embroidered upon it in golden thread. Flanking the altar are two large pillars of gold, which reach to the ceiling far over­ head. Each is made of common stone adorned by gold leaf. (Scraping the stone can produce 100 gp worth of shavings per turn.) Behind the altar is a glistening purple curtain, 20 feet wide and 10 feet tall, unmarked by any design. The 10 foot wide walls beside the curtain bear ornate carvings of the four elemental symbols. Each such design is over 5 feet wide; those of earth and water (triangle and square) are to the left, the others to the right. In the niches just north of the altar stand monumental statues, each 20 feet tall. To the left (B) is a humanoid garbed in robes, with a horned and grinning skull head (luz). To the right (C) is a monstrosity with a fat bul­ bous body, four elephantine legs, a long thin neck, and a tiny humanoid head surmount­ ing the whole (Zuggtmoy). In the corner behind each statue is a peep hole, used by those in area 433 (usually the human leaders) to watch these side areas of the Temple when the need arises. They can also view the area through the curtain behind the altar. These holes are of suffic­ ient size (nearly an inch across) to permit spell casting or the use of devices (such as wands) through them, given the proper con­ centration and aim. Altar Curtain The curtain behind the altar appears to be made of a shiny purple ribbed cloth. It is, in fact, a cluster of six violet fungi bearing spe­ cial enchantments. Unless pacified (by methods described below), they attack any­ one approaching within 5 feet of the south side. Up to 24 tentacles may be produced at once, sprouting forth from the curtain in an instant, but only 6 can attack any one man­ sized target in range. Any hit, however, causes the victim to make a saving throw vs. poison; failure means quick rot. Anyone may easily push through the curtain of fun­ gus, but doing so means that 3-5 tentacles hit automatically. The growths otherwise attack as if a 6 HD monster. An unfortunate victim loses limbs to the rot at the rate of one per round; the torso rots last, and this causes immediate death. The loss of each limb causes the effective loss of 10% of the victim's total original hit 103 points (rounded up), and this alone may slay an already-damaged victim. However, if a cure disease effect is applied within four full rounds of the hit, the victim's life may be saved. (A regenerate spell will re-grow any one limb and return the hit points for it at the same time.) One great defensive advantage to the cur­ tain is that those to the north of it (all the human leaders, in case of alert) can open it slightly to see through it. The curtain blocks all non-magical missile fire from the south side, but those to the north can fire from that direction with missiles or spells. This horrid drape can be quieted only by the presenting of a special scarab inscribed with the letters TZGY. (One such scarab may have been found in the quarters of the evil traders in the Village of Hommlet.) If such a scarab is presented towards the fungi in a manner similar to that of a cleric turning undead, all waving or attacking tentacles withdraw, and the curtain can be easily passed in safety, parting just as would a nor­ mal curtain. Each human leader in this Tem­ ple area carries a scarab of this type. Total immunity to disease prevents the fungi attacks from having any effect, of course. Resistances to poison also apply, but only as modifiers to the saving throw. The enchantments here are such that even total immunity to poison provides only a + 5 bonus to the saving throw against the rot. The enchanted fungi can only be dam­ aged by certain spells or magical edged or piercing weapons. The drape is unaffected by any sort of blunt weapon (including thrown boulders) and all mind attacks (including charm and hold spells of all sorts). Missile fire cannot pass through the drape to the area north of it (though those behind can shoot through it to the south). The drape will appear to take only a few scratches from attacks which damage it, remaining completely intact and active until the whole is destroyed (all 100 hp), when it crumbles to a the floor in a loathsome mass. Once slain, the fungi do not cause rot. Ceremonial Activity The vestments on the main altar are changed to reflect the current Temple activi­ ties with respect to the Nodes and Elemental . Planes. Creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire are now being summoned and sent to the Fire Node, as indicated by the red silk altarpiece. In the process of the ceremony, the fire creatures come forth from their ezjGiilAL ADVEilTV S REiilCAR.IlATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EilTAL EVIL Plane and arrive in area 427, proceed from there into the Greater Temple, and continue towards area 426, from whence they are sent to their proper destination. This and similar ceremonies have been witnessed by all the residents of the area. Other elemental creatures from all the Planes have arrived over the past months, all in the same fashion. If characters manage to interrogate any captives, they should eas­ ily acquire a general description of this pro­ cedure, and should thus be able to deduce the locations of the more dangerous gates (those leading off to the Planes themselves).

BROWN CORRIDOR This area is normally empty. During alerts, one hill giant is posted inside the corridor entrance. The walls of this clean hallway are as black as the Temple's at the entrance, but quickly fade to a medium tan color within 40 feet. They darken thereafter, reaching a rich nut-brown at the deepest point. On the walls are inscribed ornate abstract designs of triangles of various sizes and types, some containing large white eyes, and with bizarre and unfamiliar creatures cavorting amongst the angular landscape. Among them are a few that might be recognized by experienced characters - basilisks, gor­ gons, and monsters native to the Elemental Plane of Earth, such as xorns. 421. WEST EARTH GATE This area is normally manned by one hill giant. During alerts, the giant moves to the corridor entrance, and two bugbears take his position here. The brown corridor opens into a triangu- Jar room. The walls here are unmarked save for a huge triangle on each wall, and a bale­ ful red and white eye in each figure. A large magic circle (about 15 feet across) is inscribed in the center of the floor of the room, and within it is another triangle, but without an eye. The floor symbol marks a permanent gate to the Earth Node. Anyone standing within the magic circle for 3 segments is then instantly sent to area E-1 (q. v.). The gate can send up to 10 men (with equipment) per round. 422. EAST EARTH GATE This area is normally manned by one hill giant. During alerts, the giant moves to the corridor entrance, and two bugbears take his position here. This area is absolutely identical to area 421, but sends those within the magic circle to a randomly determined point on the Ele­ mental Plane of Earth. Those sent there are effectively retired or lost until rescued, unless they possess plane-traveling abilities. 423. GRAY CORRIDOR This area is normally empty. During alerts, one ettin is posted inside the corridor entrance. The black Temple walls quickly fade to a light gray as one passes down this corridor, becoming a dark gray with a swirling effect (as if clouds) at the deepest point. The corri­ dor walls are decorated in circles and oval designs. Winged figures and odder creatures are drawn among them, passing into and out of the circles as if such were portals. None of the monsters depicted can be seen with any clarity. 424. EAST AIR GATE This area is normally manned by one ettin. During alerts, he moves to the corridor entrance, and two bugbears take his posi­ tion here. The gray corridor opens into a circular room. The walls here are elaborately painted to resemble the view of a storm from a peace­ ful spot within it - the eye of a hurricane. A large magic circle (15 feet across) is inscribed in the center of the floor of the room, with another plainer circle within it. The floor symbol marks a permanent gate to the Air Node. Anyone standing within 104 the magic circle for 3 segments is then instantly sent to area A-1 (q. v.). The gate can send up to 10 men (with equipment) per round. 425. WEST AIR GATE This area is normally manned by one ettin. During alerts, he moves to the corridor entrance, and two bugbears take his posi­ tion here. This room is absolutely identical to area 424, but sends those within the magic circle to a randomly determined point on the Ele­ mental Plane of Air. Those sent there are effectively retired or lost until rescued, unless they possess plane-traveling abilities. 426. RED CORRIDOR This area is normally empty. During alerts, one ettin is posted inside the corridor entrance. The walls of this hallway quickly change from the Temple's black to a dull blood-red. The color lightens as one progresses further, reaching a bright orange-red flame design at the deepest point. The walls are decorated in an abstract design of interlocking eight­ pointed fire symbols. Drawn amongst the flames and symbols are pits, and from these rush dozens of fiery monsters, some recog­ nizable (such as efreet and salamanders, natives of the Elemental Plane of Fire), but most of them unknown. 427. EAST FIRE GATE This area is normally manned by one ettin. During alerts, the ettin moves to the corri­ dor entrance, and two bugbears take his position here. The red corridor opens into a room shaped like the eight-pointed fire symbol, with a large identical symbol inscribed on the floor in the center of a magic circle nearly 20 feet across. The walls here are a riot of flaming color, with fourteen other fire symbols of various sizes inscribed on the walls of the room and two facing each other at the entrance. The floor symbol marks a permanent gate to the Fire Node. Anyone standing within the magic circle for 3 segments is then instantly sent to area F-1 (q. v.). The gate can send up to 10 men (with equipment) per round. 0RjGiIIAL ADVEIITV S REiIICA1'_IIATED • THE TElhPLE 0F ELElhEilTAL EVIL 428. WEST FIRE GATE This area is normally manned by one ettin. During alerts, he moves to the corridor entrance, and two bugbears take his posi­ tion here. This room is absolutely identical to area 428, but sends those within the magic circle to a randomly determined point on the Ele­ mental Plane of Fire. Those sent there are effectively retired or lost until rescued, unless they possess plane-traveling abilities. 429. GREEN CORRIDOR This area is normally empty. During alerts, one hill giant is posted inside the corridor entrance. The color of this long corridor is a deep blackish blue-green at the entrance, but lightens to a pleasant aquamarine at the deepest point. An abstract design of squares and rectangles adorns the walls, as if to form doors and square bubbles in the water motif. Tails, fins, and other parts of aquatic monsters jut from the water scene here and there, but most of the shapes portrayed are mere shadows lurking beneath the surface. Among the creatures are a few easily recog­ nizable by experienced folk - ixitxachitl, water gargoyles, water weirds, and the like, many native to the Elemental Plane of Water. 430. FOYER This area is normally manned by one hill giant. During alerts, the giant moves to the corridor entrance, and two bugbears take his position here. The green corridor opens suddenly into a wide ceremonial area. The walls bear the same decoration, of water creatures amidst a chaotic sea of square and rectangular sym­ bols. The ceiling is painted to resemble the view upwards from under water, the surface swirls and eddies reflecting light from above. Two large ceremonial urns stand in the north corners of the room. A doorway in the center of the north wall is 10 feet wide and 15 feet high, and opens into a sunken pool area to the north. A short stair, only 5 feet wide, leads down into the pool through the doorway. The urns to the sides are filled with fresh seaweed. If consumed, a piece of weed acts as a water breathing potion but with a dura­ tion of 6 hours, plus 1-10 additional rounds. 431. EAST WATER GATE The floor of this room is about 8 feet below that of area 430, and the room is nearly filled with water. On each wall is a perfect and simple square symbol, about three feet across. A large magic circle (about 20 feet across) is inscribed in the center of the floor of the room, at the bottom of the pool, and within it is another square. The floor symbol marks a permanent gate to the Water Node. Anyone standing within the magic circle for 3 segments is then instantly sent to area W-1 (q. v.). The gate can send up to 10 men (with equipment) per round. 432. WEST WATER GATE This area is absolutely identical to area 431, but sends those within the magic circle to a randomly determined point on the Elemen­ tal Plane of Water. Those sent there are effectively retired or lost until rescued, unless they possess plane-traveling abilities. 433. INNER CHAMBER This stark area behind the altar curtain of the Greater Temple is marked only by three lesser altars, each a 10 ' long stone ovoid standing 4 feet tall. These are currently unadorned, but are draped for ceremonial occasions. The room is dimly lit by a pearly glow from the north (435). This room is normally unoccupied, used for storage and private ceremonies. If a bat­ tle occurs in area 419, this room is the post for the clerics and magic-users. Note that they may cast spells and fire devices through either the peep holes at the sides (the points marked 'a', adjacent to the statues in the Temple) or the violet curtain. Note also that defenders herein will get and use the magic items stored in the chests (see below). Black curtains block two side rooms. Each side room contains a wardrobe and two huge chests. Each wardrobe contains six vestments used by the Temple clerics in their ceremonies; those in room b are brown or red (3 of each, for Earth and Fire respec­ tively), and those in room c are green or grey. With the vestments are four neatly folded silk altar pieces of the same colors, each bearing the embroidered symbols of Iuz, the elements, and the golden skull. One altar piece of each color is 10' square, used 105 in this area; the other is 25 ' x 13 ' , used on the main altar. Each of the two chests in each side room is locked, wizard locked and fire trapped (both by Senshock, L9, the latter exploding for 10-14 points of damage if triggered), and additionally protected by two glyphs of warding, one forming a rectangle in which the chest stands and the other around the lock of the chest itself. These glyphs of elec­ tricity were placed by Hedrack, and explode for 18 points of damage (each) if a chest is touched without speaking the glyph's name. These chests contain coins used for troop payrolls and rewards, some scraps of parch­ ment, and a few magic items. Each chest contains 2,000 ep, 4,00 gp, and 1,00 pp, plus 2-20 pieces of parchment. Each parch­ ment is a letter of credit from the Temple to some individual; each note promises to pay an amount from 10 to 1,00 gp. The bor­ rowers include most of the Temple troops, guards, and leaders, since these provide additional means of forcing obedience. (The usual interest rate is 10% per week.) One magic item is in each chest. Present are a wand of ice storms with 42 charges, a wand of metal command with 21 charges, a chaotic evil candle of invocation with 3 hours burning time remaining, and a rope of entanglement. The wands are usable by any class, and the command words are known to all the Temple leaders. (These items are described in Unearthed Arcana, pages 96- 97; 3 charges will typically be spent with each use of the latter wand, to produce cry­ stalbrittle effects.) If attackers penetrate the violet curtain, the defender with the rope will probably use it in haste, ensnaring only the first four to enter the area (more or less, depending on the situation). The top step of the stairs leading down to area 434 bears a glyph of warding (electric­ ity, for 18 points of damage). The 10' x 20 ' area just south of it, between the pointed niches, is protected by multiple glyphs. Four have been placed here, each 5' wide (east­ west) and 10 ' long. Each can explode for 18 points of fire or cold damage, there being two of each. The pointed niches themselves, constructed to complete the area's mimicry of the symbol of Iuz, are useful only as aids to defense. Anyone standing within gains a -4 AC bonus and can be attacked only from the front; however, the defender cannot properly wield any weapon that requires 3 or more feet of space. (A mace or shortsword can be used.) 0NGiIIAL ADVEIITV S REiIICAR!IATED • THE TElhPLE 0F ELElhEllTAL EVIL If a follower of luz calls his name while in this area, Iuz will probably respond (a 90% chance, checked per round if necessary). Defilement of any altar, either a lesser one here or the main one just to the south, sum­ mons Iuz automatically (with a 95% chance of gaining a response). If Iuz responds, he appears in 2-9 segments in his demoniac form, his two-handed sword + 3 in hand. If any Good beings are in this room when luz arrives, St. Cuthbert may (90% chance) arrive 2-9 segments later. If Good beings are in an adjacent area (419 or 434), the same chance applies, but Cuthbert does not appear for 4-32 segments. (See Appendix A for details on luz and St. Cuthbert.) Horrible punishments await anyone who bothers Iuz unnecessarily, so the Temple's leaders will not call him unless one of two situations occurs - either they have won a battle and have captives to offer him as sac­ rifices, or their troops have lost miserably and they need his aid to prevent their final defeat. Note, however, that if a PC assault­ ing the area has completed the assembly of Yellowskull (by first exploring the Nodes to retrieve the gems of power), even the Old One is relatively powerless to prevent the final defeat of the Temple of Elemental Evil. 434. NEXUS Broad stairs lead down from the inner chamber (433) into a round room 60 feet in diameter. A soft glow from the destination lights the stairway in an odd pearly glow mixed with occasional flashes of other col­ ors. The walls of the round chamber are verti­ cal, 20 feet tall, capped by a dome reaching 10 feet further. In the center of the room is a round dais about 2 feet tall, which is pre­ cisely encircled by a column of shimmering light·, the source of the radiant colors, which extends to the ceiling. The walls and ceiling are ornately deco­ rated by a mosaic mural, apparently made entirely of precious stones - emeralds, rubies, onyx, and the like. Not a square inch is uncovered. The scene on the walls is one of glory and conquest, showing the lands around as seen from the parapets of the Temple itself. The countryside is somewhat warped (in an undefinable way) but easily recognizable, and is filled with beings - human, humanoid, and monstrous mixed together - all facing and paying homage to the Temple. Intruders may pry out up to 65 gems with relative impunity, each worth 100-100 gp. However, if and when a 66th gem is removed, the attention of luz is called to the chamber, and he arrives in 1-4 rounds, accompanied by 1-4 demons of types 1-4 (each variable checked by a separate roll). Iuz also comes if the area is damaged by fire or lightning, or possibly (80% chance) if his name is spoken aloud by anyone in the chamber. If the pillar of light is touched or exam­ ined, refer to area 429. 435. LIGHT CHAMBER This pillar of light in the center of area 434 is a cylinder 30 feet tall and 20 feet in diameter. It is powerfully magical, emanating altera­ tion, conjuration, enchantment, and evoca­ tion in equal measures. Details of the area within the light are not discernible except with magical aiding, or other similar aid reveals that an ornate silver throne occupies the center of the light. Looking beyond the throne, the observer gets the definite impression of vast distance, but without detail save a far-off swirling mist. Objects can easily penetrate the borders of the light, but any non-evil creature touching it immediately loses 1 level of experience via energy drain (no saving throw) and must make a saving throw vs. spells or take 3-30 points of electrical dam­ age and be knocked 5 feet backward. Any touch produces a moderately loud clap of thunder, emanating from the light. If the victim saves, all electrical damage is negated, and no movement is forced; the victim may enter the light if desired. The throne within is silver, adorned by hun­ dreds of precious gems. These are set to form leering demon faces, skulls, fungi, and like patterns; they are of all colors, sizes, and shapes. (This throne is identical to Zuggt­ moy's, found in her Great Hall on Dungeon Level Three, area 364. Each gem is likewise linked to a demon, as explained in that area description.) The light automatically and immediately gives the following abilities to anyone within it - true seeing, detect magic, and ESP. The latter is even powerful enough to penetrate anti-scrying magic (such as an amulet of proof against detection and loca­ tion) 90% of the time (check per round, as applicable). These abilities remain as Jong as the recipient stays in the light, but instantly 106 vanish upon exit from it. Anyone sitting in the throne is immedi­ ately in mental contact with Zuggtmoy her­ self. She cannot communicate in words or pictures, but may use her psionic abilities and disciplines to affect the user. If a fol­ lower of Zuggtmoy, the user is probably (90% chance, no saving throw) struck with fear and awe of her power, and effectively charmedby her for 1-6 turns. The leaders of the Great Temple thus use the throne to inform Zuggtmoy of recent events and needs, and receive general feelings - approval, pleasure, anger, etc. - from her. Note that through this medium, Zuggtmoy can freely use her psionics, whatever the current limits on her powers may be. Any non-follower who sits in the throne must make two more saving throws, one vs. spells and one vs. psionics (as per DMG page 78; however, see below if the victim is also psionic). The first is a mind attack, and adjustments for Wisdom apply; if failed, the victim is charmed (as the spell). The second saving throw is for an initial psionic blast (mode A). Success for either indicates no effect from the applicable attack form. The charm will not be repeated, but the psionic blasts will probably recur every round. Special: If the victim is psionic, run a standard psionic-only battle between him or her and the demoness. Zuggtmoy has all modes (ABCDE/FGHIJ), with psionic strength 222. No multiple links are possible within the light chamber. The victim cannot rise from the throne while attacking psioni­ cally, but may do so while using defense modes only. However, Zuggtmoy can and will break off the combat completely when and if her remaining strength drops to 75 or less. 0RjGiIIAL ADVEII1'V S REiIICAR.IIA1'ED • THE TEJtcPLE 0F ELEJtcEllTAL EVIL Part 4: Nodes of Elemental Evil Four partial planes were created by Zug­ gtmoy to be used both as sources of power and as places of preparation and storage. They are permanently and magically tied to the northern areas of dungeon levels 3 and 4, and accessible from these locations if the proper methods are employed. Each of these partial planes (also called nodes) is filled by a tiny moon-like body, stranded in a small, odd, and isolated region of magically created space. Severely dis­ torted effects of many sorts bedevil the sur­ face of the moon, being within a mile of the very edge of the plane itself. Thus, the 100 square miles of surface area is largely avoided. A small part of the interior of each node is in use. Although a node is almost 5 1/z miles across (29,00 feet in diameter, or a total of 94 cubic miles), the space in current use is only about 1600 by 2100 feet in width, vary­ ing from 10 to 250 feet in depth. The nodes exist only as long as their con­ nections to the dungeon remain unbroken. If Zuggtmoy is slain, the connections van­ ish, and the nodes do likewise. Any and all things within them at that time are sent whirling into a plane of the Abyss, either to Zuggtmoy's or one adjacent (planes 221- 223). On two of the node maps-those for the Air and Water nodes-the scale is much greater than on the dungeon maps. Each square thereon is 50 feet on a side, instead of 10. Despite the size of the areas, however, indoor scale is used throughout (limiting range measurements). The other two maps (the Earth and Fire Nodes) use standard scale, with 10-foot squares. With standard slow and careful dungeon progress, a party may take many days to explore the entire node map. But once characters become more used to the terrain, they may move at up to 5 times normal rate if desired-a 6" rate thus moving up to 30 squares per tum (or 6 on the Air and Water maps). Note, however, that such a speedy rate increases chances of surprise by + 1, to 3 in 6 (2 in 6 for rangers). TRANSPORTATION On maps 14 through 19, the symbols used for the elements are a square for water, the eight-pointed symbol of fire, a circle for air, and a triangle for earth. All of these symbols are magical, being the locations of gates. A sizeable glyph about 10 feet across is visible on the floor at each such location. Up to eight human-sized beings can occupy a glyph at one time. In dungeon area 351 and in each node, anyone standing on one of these symbols for three segments is sent from there to the appropriate elemental node. The user arrives at the center of the node map; see the appropriate area description for details. Each node map contains only three of the symbols, the one corresponding to the node itself being omitted. Dungeon area 419 has many halls which lead to gates to the nodes (and to the actual elemental planes as well), as noted in the area descriptions. Each gate bears a corres­ ponding symbol, and each works in similar fashion (but is stepped through, rather than stood upon). Anyone possessing a power gem for the Yellowskull can modify the transportation effect of the corresponding glyph (e.g. the smoky quartz can affect the air glyph-the circle-but no other). The user must hold the gem (either loose or mounted) while entering the glyph, concentrating on another identical glyph (those in the dungeon or another node). After the usual three segments, the user-and any other creature(s) entering the glyph during the same round-is sent to one of the identical glyphs, rather than the center of the corres­ ponding node. Use ld4 to randomly find the actual destination: 1-2 - the same symbol in a node, 3 = dungeon level 3 (area 351), 4 - dungeon level 4 (area 421, 422, 424, 425, 427, 428, 431, or 432 as per symbol). The glyph at the point of arrival is deactivated for one round by this use, but must be evac­ uated quickly lest it send the traveler(s) away in the next round (after the usual three segments of occupation). Note that the Orb itself is not needed for the above change in the use of the symbols; only one of the appropriate gems is required. The modified result applies only to that use of the glyph, and does not per­ manently change it in any way. Escape from the nodes by other means is highly unlikely. A wish, plane shift, and cer­ tain other spell effects may allow transpor­ tation, as detailed in the following list of spell modifications. No other magical or mundane means will succeed. The number of current occupants of the nodes testifies to the security of the whole. 107 ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE The climate within each node was designed for the comfort of the elemental beings within. The concentrated raw ele­ ments may cause damage to visitors. Care­ fully keep track of time when characters enter an elemental node. Completely unpro­ tected beings native to the Prime Plane take 1-4 points of damage each turn of exposure in the node. Any being with AC 2 or better takes only 1-3 points per turn. Practical non-magical aids (furs or coats in the chilly air node, removing armor in the fire node, and so forth) reduces damage to 1-2 points per turn. Any magical or innate resistance to the element or its effects negates environ­ mental damage completely. Environmental damage is sporadic, not constant. It does not absolutely prevent spell casting, but may cause problems. The DM should check each spell cast, rolling ld6; if the result is 1, the caster takes some of the environmental damage during the casting, which spoils the spell and prevents its completion. Ignore this effect, of course, if the caster is magically immune to the envi­ ronmental damage. DEVELOPMENT In play, the characters may find their way to the nodes in search of some means of destroying Zuggtmoy, the Temple, and so forth -and the gems of the nodes provide the keys to do so, given the discovery of the Orb as well (either before or after the gems' recovery, actually). But if they blunder into the nodes, or are forced therein by the press of a massed monster attack (especially on Dungeon Level Four), they will doubtless spend much time there, wandering and searching for the exit. Such victims are nearly doomed unless they find and then discover the uses of the gems of power. Space does not here permit a full descrip­ tion of each small part of the four nodes; after all, even with the limited space in use, each node complex comprises more area than all four dungeon levels! Random and placed encounters are given, with other notes, so that the whole is playable as it stands. But a small amount of time, effort, and skill on your part can develop the rough notes into fully polished gems of adventure, just aching for discovery. The map areas have been numbered to ease your further development. Suggested 0NGiIIAL A.DVEIIfVIQOS REi IICAR.IIAfED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJl EilTA.L EVIL areas for lairs are given in the area notes. Select from the monster lists to populate the map areas, and add rewards appropriate to the treasure types. When magic is indicated, roll ldlOO and refer to the Magic Treasure Table to find the exact items. Hundreds of adventurers, humanoids, and others have vanished into the nodes, and their traces (or even descendants or sur­ vivors!) may be found anywhere. Sacrifices arrive daily, even now at a low point of the Temple's power, taken through the long halls and tossed through the gates by the clerics and troops of the Greater Temple on Dungeon Level Four. If any notable NPCs in your campaign have been missing, they might show up here. The same applies to singular magical devices once in their (or others') possession, of course. And for higher level parties, cer­ tain powerful creatures once banished from or defeated on the Prime Plane due to past character actions might be found herein, having struck a pact with Iuz and Zuggtmoy in exchange for permanent or temporary visiting rights . . . . Herein should be all the tools for you, as Dungeon Master, to tailor the game to the characters. If their powers are lacking, they can find equipment and allies. If healthy, they should not lack for opponents. You have complete control, with the freedom to add subplots, clues, suspense, and excite­ ment as you see fit. In short, develop the nodes to suit your­ self and your characters. Apply the general modifications given for magic, and the guidelines for resident creatures, but elabo­ rate and expand on the basics given so that the adventures herein are challenging and meaningful to your players, while offering some slim chance of victory and escape. MODIFICATIONS 10 MAGIC The elemental nodes are very close to the Prime Plane, so distance causes no ill effects to most magical items. No 'plusses' are lost from permanent items. However, many spell effects may be altered, and effects pro­ duced by devices may be likewise (based on the similar spell effect). Element-based effects and attacks have double effect (range, duration, damage, etc.) in the node of the same element, but half effect in one opposite node. For exam­ ple, a fireball would explode to double vol­ ume (67,020 cubic feet, or a sphere of about 25' radius) and double damage in the fire node, or half volume (16,705 cubic feet, or just under 16' radius) in the water node. Water and ice-based effects are halved in the fire node; air and earth-based attacks are modified in like manner. When an effect is based on two elements, modifications are halved-i.e. one-quarter damage instead of half, or 50% extra instead of doubled. Sav­ ing throws against double-strength effects are made at -4, and at + 4 against half­ strength. Refer to the lists below for other altera­ tions (both mandatory and possible) in spells and spell-like effects produced by items. 108 SPELL VARIATIONS Some spells (but not item effects) can be deliberately altered if the caster knows how to do so. When the phrase 'Can be cast as . .  : is given in the listing, the spell caster can learn how to produce the given altered effect when the spell has been cast 2-3 times. In such listings, 'element' refers to the local material at hand-create element creates fire in the fire node, earth in that node, and so forth. Once an altered version is under­ stood, it may be used on any element (i.e. separate practice is not required for each), and may even be transcribed onto a scroll in modified form, for later use, sale, research, etc. The unchanged spell may still be cast in any node except for its 'opposite' (as detailed above). To introduce the spell variations in play, check each spell cast in a node against the fol­ lowing list. If it can be modified, tell the player that the character senses the potential change, and can learn more with just a bit of practice. When the character learns the modified ver­ sions, it may be helpful to check off the spell on the list below, or to note the name of the caster for future reference.

Some came from the Prime, trapped or lured here. Very few have escaped, even 0NGiilAL A.DVEilTVRJ;S REiilCARJIATED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEllTA.L EVIL after many long years. Zuggtmoy's beloved molds and goops also wander the nodes, coming and going at the bidding of their mistress. It is important to note that the elementals and related creatures herein are free-willed, not conjured or summoned, but are trapped. They are unaffected by dispel magic, and are not blocked by protection from evil. They are also not necessarily hos­ tile, being Neutral and as eager to escape as are the characters. Should communication be established, or some indication of friend­ liness be given (such as offered treasure or food), elementals might very well agree to peaceful coexistence or even a limited part­ nership for a time. The lists of creatures found in the Nodes give numbers appearing, but you may mod­ ify these to suit the PCs' level and relative health. Most creatures should be initially encountered in small numbers, roving near or far from their lair. Do not suddenly intro­ duce the entire complement of a creature type in one sudden swoop. The several true elementals found in each Node should be encountered singly, having no actual lair. Finally, some few residents, especially the evil ones of lower intelligence, may still be working toward a greater goal set by their leaders luz and Zuggtmoy long ago. They may be developing areas, digging new tun­ nels, or simply patrolling for intruders. In any event they are dangerous fanatics, fighting to the death to ensure the continued completion of their assigned tasks. RANDOM ENCOUNTERS To check for wandering monsters in any node, roll ldlOO once per turn and refer to the table. All monsters are considered native to their nodes, and do not take envi­ ronmental damage. Wandering humans are garbed in a manner appropriate to their sur­ roundings, and have become immune to environmental effects through long expo­ sure to them. Statistics for Zuggtmoy's pets can be found in Appendix B (under Zuggtmoy); node residents are described in the following encounter keys. A few wandering humans are detailed below. Ash rem This bitter old man was once the chief cleric of the air temple (dungeon area 210), but was replaced by Kelno a few years ago. Betrayed by his brother Alrrem (of the fire temple, area 212), he was sacrificed to the air temple and cast off into the nodes. But his feigned death saved him; he was able to cure his near-mortal wounds, and has sur­ vived in the nodes by avoiding everyone and scavenging what materials he can find. He has a cache of spell components, both clerical and magic-user types, hidden some­ where in the nodes, and will use this to bar­ ter should he be endangered by adventurers. Ashrem lives for revenge on his brother. He wears ill-fitting and damaged chain mail, taken from the body of a larger fighter, and carries a scarred shield bearing the symbol of Sir Robilar (a green dragon on yellow field). He carries a mace, hammer, and many empty sacks (both small and large) for scavenging. If questioned, Ashrem reveals his name and profession, and seeks aid in escaping. He will eagerly join a party if asked. He has seen most of the other wandering humans at some time or another, but has avoided them, believing them hostile and danger­ ous. ldlOO Result 01 Ascomid 02 Basidirond 03-04 Gray ooze 05--06 Ochre jelly 07 Phycomid 08-10 Pudding* 11 Ustilagor 12 Zygom 13 Wandering human (roll again)** 14-20 Node resident* * * 21-00 No encounter * Pudding type varies by node: air - white, earth = black, fire - dun, water = brown * * See list below * * * Select or randomly determine one mon­ ster of the types placed in the node.

They found the gates to the nodes, and their leader ordered them through when approaching ettins were sighted. The leader has since been slain by monsters, as were over a dozen of the bandits. The remaining seven bandits are led by their cleric, who literally rules by the powers of life and death he wields through his spells. They are scavengers and cow­ ards, having survived nearly two months by their methods. If left alone, they will lose one of their number each 1-4 days, until none remain. The bandits prefer to attack from ambush, so an encounter with them will probably (75 % )  given them 1-3 surprise seg­ ments from such a situation. If so, they begin with missile fire from cover. They pre­ fer to remain behind cover for as long as possible, but will engage if necessary. When wounded, however, any bandit will flee at the beginning of the following round.

She is friendly, and claims to be a magic-user. She will eagerly join a party if invited, and will behave perfectly for at least two days of adventuring to allay any suspicions. Darley is an alu-demon who was once part of a demonic faction allied against luz. The group was utterly defeated, of course, and its members scattered, banished, or imprisoned. Darley is one of the lucky ones, allowed to wander here in the nodes. Darley fakes spellcasting gestures and sounds, in conjunction with her spell-like abil­ ities, to bolster her magic-user image. She can use any of the following abilities up to once per round, each up to three times daily at 12th level ability: chan person, ESP, shapechange 0NGiITAL A.DVEil1'V S REi ITCARJIA1'ED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEilTAL EVIL GRANK JAER DARLEY 0NGiilAL ADVEilTVRJ:S REiilCAR_IlATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EilTAL EVIL ASH REM SARGErl TAKI 0NGiilAL ADVEilTVRJ:S REiilCAR_IlATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EilTAL EVIL (to humanoid form of same size &: weight), and sugestion.

He regretted his choice almost immediately, but when he tried to quit, was given to and questioned by the leaders of the Greater Temple, and then thrown into the nodes. Jaer's survival is due to his craft. He has made armor, shield, and tools by weaving scraps he has found. He has wandered the nodes for only three weeks, and is becoming desperate. He was once looted and chased off by the wandering bandits, and thus will be distrustful of the party at first. But he will eagerly ally with a friendly group, and will put his skills to good use. Jaer's weapons include a normal sword, dagger, and hammer, and also 20 'fire balls' -woven bundles of flammable material, which can be ignited and thrown to 3 w range, inflicting 1-4 points of damage if a hit is scored. Jaer carries a lit lamp most of the time for igniting his fire balls.

He has little equipment, having survived by hiding and eating any­ thing he could find. He has passed into insanity in the last months, and believes every creature he sees to be a demon or devil of some sort. When encountered, Sargen has worked up his courage and approaches the party, groveling. Believing them to be a troupe of wandering demons, he plans to beg for release, offering thousands of gold pieces and future service in exchange. (His cash is at his home, on the Prime Plane, but is quite real.) If attacked or threatened, he flees immediately, and future encounters will be at a distance, again causing him to flee. Sargen only retains two spells, saved for emergencies-invisibility and fly. His spell book is long lost.

He was separated from his party about four months ago when they entered the Greater Temple. He was forced to retreat down a side corridor, and ended up in the nodes (fully equipped). Taki has survived by brute force. He once allied with Ashrem for a short time, receiv­ ing curing in exchange for his combat prow­ es. But after being tricked several times, his dislike of the cleric grew, and he went off on his own. Taki will be suspicious of any party he meets but, if invited, will adventure with them for an hour or two, provided that any of his wounds are cured by PCs. He departs to sleep in a hiding place of his own prefer­ ence, away from the party. After two or three days with a well-behaved and intelli­ gent party, he will join them if asked. Any evil or stupid behavior, however, causes him to leave and continue his lonely quest for escape.

The relatively constant 114 60 degree temperature (F) is comfortable to all herein, but the winds range from mild gusts of 10-20 mph to full gales of 100 + mph. The environmental damage is due to dust, pebbles, and other debris blown by the winds. Those arriving in the air caverns appear on a plateau atop a central spire, standing 200 feet above the floor level and reaching to within SO feet of the cavern's roof. A steep slope down spirals widdershins from the peak. Light seems to come from the ceiling of the cavern, casting a soft twilight glow throughout the area. The visibility from the peak is fair; many cave entrances can be dimly sen in the distance. Dense clouds of random shapes and sizes drift in the great cavern. Though they are constantly pushed and torn by the winds, they do not disperse easily. At floor level, however, visibility varies widely. When necessary, the DM may roll 2d4 to find the number of map squares (each SO '  across) visible in any one direc­ tion, but this could change in a short time, possibly -0nly a round or two. The slopes, stairs, and caverns themsel­ ves are hewn of solid rock, apparently by very good craftsmen. All surfaces are strewn with rubble, an occasional bone or bit of lost, worn equipment, and an infre­ quent shallow pit or landslide. Though most of the Air Caverns are dry and fairly mild, areas #13-16 are dotted with pools of icy water, with frozen lumps on the walls. These caves are even cooler towards their northern ends, where part of a glacial outcropping can be sen (areas 15-16): BRIEF AREA NOTES A 1 Top of peak (point of arrival) A 2 East floor area A 3 North floor area A 4 South floor area A S Huge cavern south, at ground level A 6 Shelf, 120' above floor level, reached by a slope to the west A 7 Cave at ground level A 8 Hidden niche, 80 ' above ground level, reached by a slope to the north.

Earth Node DESCRIPTION The Earth Burrows are dark and slightly damp-a typical cave-dungeon setting. The temperature is a constant 45 degrees, with little or no air movement. The environmen­ tal damage comes from the ever-present heavy dust in the air, and from occasional rockslides, minor cave-ins, and so forth. Those arriving in the Burrows appear in the center cave, a large broad area SO feet tall at its center tapering to only 10-20 feet at the side corridors. The corridors have no light, and the dusty air permits only half normal range of sight, whether normal or infravision. Slopes are few, and the stone is dug out, rather than worked.

Fire Node DESCRIPTION The rooms and corridors of the dreaded Fire Pits are humid and hot-so hot that the subse­ quent environmental damage is inflicted over periods of exposure. The areas are lit, either dimly or brightly, by the occasional pits of burning embers and leaping flames, as noted on the map. Those arriving here appear in the central room, faced with a choice of eight doors. They, and all other portals in the Node, are large stone constructions with brass fittings. They stick frequently (-1 penalty to all 'open doors' rolls), but are edged by ample cracks which allow fire creatures and others of mutable form to seep through them even when closed. The rooms and corridors, hewn from the surrounding rock, are well-made, perhaps by earth elementals or magic. Many surfaces are scorched and scratched, but few are chipped. Bits and scraps are rare, only found in small piles and singed on the upper side.

Water rtode DESCRIPTION The Water Maze is a great indoor ocean, a magical place suitable to both salt and fresh­ water beings. The ceiling of the great cavern casts a soft moonlight-bright glow. From the central pool, one might imagine the place to be a tropical atoll; but danger lurks throughout. The air is changeable, once a lilting warm breeze and then suddenly a chilling draft. Swirling eddies in both the water and the air produce sudden changes in waves at any time. Mists rise from the water, adding an air of mystery and suspense to the visually peaceful setting. But it is these oddly tinted mists that poison the very air, causing the given environmental damage to the unpro­ tected. The depth of the water varies widely but averages about 50 feet. The dozens of craggy islets reach 10 to 80 feet from the sur­ face, stretching towards the cavern roof far overhead (100-150 feet up) like pointing skeletal fingers. Icebergs dot the coldest part 118 of the water, mostly to the northeast comer of the map. Newcomers to the Node land asplash in the central pool area, which is only 10 feet deep and protected· from most of the sea dwellers by a coral reef. Some few small scavengers might be lurking therein, but they will probably avoid a group of nervous humans. BRIEF AREA NOTES W 1 Center pond (arrival point). A coral ridge surrounds this area, fencing a pool about 75 ' by 450 ' in size. Within the area are several rock and coral outcroppings, jutting 10-30 feet above the surface of the water. W 2 North sea W 3 Shelf, rising from the water to 10' above it at the northern edge. W 4 Shelf-grotto (lair). This appears as if a water-filled cave, but its floor rises to above water level past the entrance. Around the corner to the northwest is a circle symbol, gate to the Air Node.

W 10 Shelf, just under water level, encir­ cled by stone on the west and north sides W 11 West sea, south branch W 12 Southeast sea W 13 Hidden grotto W 14 Hidden shelf. The entrances to this area are underwater, but the shelf rises sharply reaching 10 ' above water level at the northernmost grotto. Therein is a triangle symbol, gate to the Earth Node. W 15 Channel W 16 Southwest cave, with submerged entrance (accessible only by a brief underwater swim; lair) W 17 Southwest sea W 18 Submerged shelf, about 10' below water level.

A list of the greater and leser gods of the WORLD OF GREYHAWK"' Fantasy Game Setting, with active demigods, is given hereaf­ ter. St. Cuthbert and Iuz, both germane to this campaign, are then specifically detailed. They, along with other deities commonly involved with adventurers are likewise found in the WORLD OF GREYHAWK"' Game Setting. There is ample reason to allow players to carefuly peruse this list of deities, and the gen­ eral descriptive notes given in the WORLD OF GREYHAWK"' Setting Catalogue. As inhabit­ ants of the Flanaes, the characters would cer­ tainly be aware of this information. From the list they should choose deities appropriate to their characters' alignments and places of ori­ gin. Remind your players that the local folk tend towards the Druidical faith (Ehlonna, Obad­ hai, and most of al Beory), or follow St. Cuthbert, or serve some deity of Evil (in the case of unsavory elements). Because of the plots of Iuz and various demons and evil elemental types, St. Cuthbert has become actively aware of events, and has indirect assistance from Beory (who resists ele­ mental destruction). The enmity between luz and St. Cuthbert may result in direct confron­ tation! In the following list, the deity's name is followed by the racial origin, using simple abbreviations: c 0 s F B u Common in most areas Oeridian Suloise Flan Baklunish Unknown or indeterminate origin Note that deities can be of a certain racial origin and common in general at the same time. The major attributes are given in column three, followed by alignment and sex. With respect to alignment, the standard capital letters are given, possibly with a parentheti­ cal after-note. STANDARD DIVINE ABILITIES The following spell-like powers are com­ mon to all deities in this setting. Each is usa­ ble at will, up to once per round, and is activated by brief concentration alone.

He is, however, the first known godling of Chaotic Evil, whose wickedness and treachery are infamous throughout the Flanaess. This cruel being can appear as either a massive (7' tall) fat man with demoniac fea­ tures, reddish skin, pointed ears, and long steely fingers, or as an old and wrinkled manikin scarcely 5 feet in height. Either might be Iuz' true form-or even both. Iuz rules a portion of Oerth, a horrid ter­ ritory which bears its master's name, from the cursed city of Molag. Few creatures beyond the boundaries of this domain will even speak his name, let alone adore him. In his demoniac form, Iuz prefers to wield a great two-handed sword + 3, though he can, of course, use other weapons. In any guise, Iuz can use his exceptionally long and sinewy digits to claw, strike, and strangle. If he strikes thus twice, the victim of his stran­ gling grasp will die in 2-5 rounds unless freed. In his manikin-like form, luz has the 121 ability to generate a disgusting spittle which he can expectorate once per round. This substance ages the victim struck by 1-6 years (no saving throw), and withers the area hit, numbing one member and making it useless for 2-5 rounds. His wrinkled vis­ age projects a negative Charisma (-4) , which causes Horror to all those of 6 or fewer Hit Dice, for a -55% reaction penalty. Iuz is rumored to have a Soul Object secreted on the Abyssal Plane dominated by the demoness Zuggtmoy, with whom he is known to consort. He is thus free to roam outside his domain without fear of perma­ nent harm. He is also said to wear an old, short cape which boosts his Magic Resist­ ance by 20 % , and serves as a cloak of pro­ tection + 4 as well. Great emnity exists between Iuz and St. Cuthbert. This is carried on by the servants of the two, as well. Clerics of Iuz dress in rusty black (their master's favorite color) or white streaked with rust-red bloodstains. At 3rd level each gains the ability to change self (as the illu­ sionist spell) once per day. Their ceremonies include the burning of foul-smelling sub­ stances, the beating of great drums and the clangor of bronze bells, and blood sacrifice whenever possible. Places of service to Iuz must be old, filthy, and dark. Altar services are typically of bone, and include many skulls. In addition to the standard divine abilities and the other abilities listed above, Iuz also has the following standard powers of any demigod. As often as desired: finger of death, invis­ ibility, phantasmal force, protection from good 10' radius, remove fear, summon fol­ lowers (1-2 creatures of the same type and alignment, up to 20 Hit Dice total), wall of force. Three times per day: cure light wounds, raise dead. Twice per day: dispel good, dispel illu­ sion, dispel magic, true seeing. Once per day: anti-magic shell, command (2 round duration), gate, heal, unholy word, limited wish, symbol. 0JtjGiilAL ADVEilTV S REiilCAR!JATED • THE TEJlPLE 0F ELEJlEilTAL EVIL ST.

He wears a simple plate mail of + 5 enchantment. Atop his helmet is a crumpled hat, and a starburst of rubies set in platinum hangs on his chest. In his left hand he caries a billet of wood. This bronzewood cudgel is actually, in St. Cuthbert's grasp, a + 3 weapon equal to a morning star. Any human touched by the cud­ gel must make a saving throw vs. spells or be beguiled for 5-20 turns. In his right hand is the fabled Mace of St. Cuthbert, a mace of disrup­ tion + S with other powers. H the "to hit" roll is a natural 20, the victim loses 1 point of intel­ ligence (no saving throw, no magic resist­ ance). The Mace of St. Cuthbert has the following additional powers: bles (by tapping touch), know alignment (once per day), tongues, exorcise (once per month), and remove curse (seven per week). St. Cuthbert hates Evil, but his major interest is in Law and Order, and the dual work of conversion and prevention from backsliding of "true believers:· He seldom leaves his plane, unless some great duty brings him forth. When on the Prime Plane, he sometimes appears as a manure-covered yokel, or as a wanderer clad in brown and green robes, or as an elderly and slight tin­ ker. In these guises he tests the doctrine of his faithful, or seeks new converts. He can gate to or from Arcadia or the Prime Mate­ rial Plane at will. The three orders of the priesthood of St. Cuthbert are the Chapeaux, the Stars, and the Billets. The Chapeaux dress in varying garb, but all wear crumpled hats. They seek to convert people to the faith. At third level, each gains the ability to cast one shilelagh spell per day. The Stars wear dark gren robes with a star­ burst holy symbol of copper, gold, or plati­ num (depending on their status). They sek to retain doctrinal purity amongst the faithful. At fourth level, each Star cleric gains the abil­ ity to cast one ESP spell per day. The Billets are the most numerous of those in the orders, serving as ministers and protectors of the faithful. Billets dress in simple brown and russet garments, and use a holy symbol of an oaken or bronzewood billet. At second level, each gains the ability to cast one friends spell per day. While St. Cuthbert has many large places of worship, wayside shrines and small, rude chapels are the usual. His followers are found mainly in the central Flanaes, around Grey­ hawk, the Wild Coast, Umst, and Verbobonc. A great rivalry exists between those who fol­ low St. Cuthbert and the followers of Pholtus (of the Blinding Light). In addition to the standard divine abilities (given at the beginning of this Appendix) and the other abilities listed above, St. Cuthbert also has the following standard powers of any lesser god. As often as desired: control temperature 10' radius, improved invisibility; improved phantasmal force, remove curse, remove fear, summon followers (1-3 creatures of the same type and alignment, 25 Hit Dice total). Four times per day: dispel evil, dispel illu­ sion, dispel magic. Three times per day: cure serious wounds, resurrection, true seeing. Twice per day: anti-magic shell, gate, heal, holy word, polymorph others, protec­ tion from evil 20' radius, symbol. Once per day: command (3 round dura­ tion), death spell, minor globe of invulnerabil­ ity; quest, restoration, trap the soul, wish. 122 0R.iGiilAL ADVEilTV S REiilCARJIATED • THE TEJh:PLE 0F ELEJh:EllTAL EVI L Appendix B: Monsters ZUGGTMOY (Demoness Lady of Fungi) FREQUENCY: Very rare NO.

The opposing clerics and magic­ users confined her somewhere beneath the ground, reputedly with the aid of one or more deities. Though Zuggtmoy has a relatively light armor class for a major demon, she has a great number of hit points. Further, she regenerates 1 hit point per round, or double that if standing upon or in loose soil. In her natural form, Zuggtmoy is able to move rapidly despite her bulk, and can walk on walls or even inverted (such as on ceilings), though such modes reduce the maximum rate. She can use her 4 pseudo­ pods to strike opponents, each inflicting 2-8 points of damage. Up to two hits can be made on a single opponent; if both hit, an additional 5-8 points of crushing damage also applies (a total damage of 9-24 points for the two blows). Zuggtmoy may choose to trample, instead of striking with blows. Trampling, effective only against prone or small (under 4 ' )  creatures, consists of two attacks against one opponent, each inflict­ ing 2-12 points of damage; if both hit, the victim is also stunned for 1-4 rounds. In her human form, appearing as an old and feeble crone, Zuggtmoy can only attack with some weapon or spell-like power (at 22nd level of magic use). Zuggtmoy has the following spell-like powers, each usable at will: anti-plant shell astral spell charm plants continual darkness detect good detect magic entangle fear 15' radius improved invisibility hold plant levitate locate plants plant door plant growth pass plant pollute food & drink programmed ilusion read languages read magic silence 15' radius snare speak with plants telekinese (10,00 gp weight) tongues transport via plants trip She can become ethereal twice per day, and can use each of the following once per day: limited wish, gate, summon Fungi. Her gate (70% successful) may be attempted up to once per round, but will succeed only once daily; it summons (01-50) 1-4 Type I demons, (51-75) 1-3 Type II demons, (76-90) 1-2 Type III demons, "or (91-00) 1 babau demon. (The first three are described in the AD&D® MONSTER MANUAL, pages 16- 18. See MONSTER MANUAL II, page 36, for the babau.) When Zuggtmoy uses her summon fungi ability, refer to that table and roll ld6 to find the monsters responding. The monsters arrive within 1 round, oozing forth from her bloated body. All fungi are described below, 123 in addition to the standard listings. When­ ever Zuggtmoy is in her lair, she is accompa­ nied by all of the creatures on the summoning table (in the maximum numbers given), as well as poisonous toadstools, molds (brown, russet, and yellow), and a host of other dangerous and disgusting growths. As she is currently bound in a portion of the dungeons of her own creation, the XP award for Zuggtmoy's conquerors is much less than normal: 28,770. (See area 353 for details on her limits, and for revised XP val­ ues if she is partially freed.)

She resembles a puffball mush­ room with a toadstool growing on top. Four elephantine legs with suckered bottoms sup­ port the spherical body. The globular torso is flattened at the bottom and bulges at its equator, so that the legs reach to a bit over 3-foot height, the body another 30 inches higher, but with a horizontal diameter of nearly five feet. The mushroom-stem neck is two feet long, capped by a head which appears to have squashed humanoid fea­ tures. The eyes are round, black, and blank -looking. Zuggtmoy can extrude a pair of three-foot long pseudopodia) arms from either hemi­ sphere of her body, at will. These growths can extend opposing digits if desired. The body coloration is variable, as Zuggtmoy is able to change it to suit her sur­ roundings, though she is typically of a pale grayish-white or brownish-white color, the head slightly darker. Color can be moss green, dull brown, red-orange, mottled pur­ ple, etc., ranging the whole spectrum of col­ ors possible to fungi growths. Body texture and odor are likewise obviously fungoid. In all, Zuggtmoy is revolting to behold and disgusting to smell; blotchy patches of mold, smut, and blight cover her body. Her strength is great (19), and her gross weight is quite high, despite her fungoid nature­ over 2,00 pounds . . 0R.iGinAL ADVEil'fV S REinCARJIA'fED • THE TED:rPLE 0 F  ELED:rEilTAL EVIL ZUGGTMOY'S BELOVED Here are summarized the details of the vari­ ous molds and growths typically found with Zuggtmoy.

The creature's form always has wheels, runners, or some other source of mobility. Just as the mimic can project a pseudo­ pod, so can its cousin produce several growths-including slim toothy heads, pin­ cers, rams, and so forth. It can make up to six attacks per round in this way, depending on the limits of its shape. The juggernaut can also change form to some extent, but more slowly than the mimic. Once pseudopods are cut off or re­ absorbed into the body mass, up to a month may be needed to re-grow them, again depending on their forms. Heads on pseudo­ pods may permit the juggernaut to make noises of many sorts, and some few can even speak (though poorly). A juggernaut with wheels or rollers can­ not turn sharply or reverse directions unless it first comes to a complete halt. For every ten feet it travels it can turn about three feet; it must travel 30 feet to make a 90 degree turn. It is also slow to start. In the first round of animation it can move but ten feet per round, gaining 1 "  additional movement each round thereafter until its maximum 12 " rate is achieved. (For example, in the ninth round of animation it moves at 9 "  rate.) This ungainly movement is, of course, balanced by an additional attack form. Such a juggernaut may attack by simply rolling over a victim, crushing everything in its path. A normal "to hit" roll is made (situ- ation permitting). If the juggernaut hits, all the victim's items must be checked vs. crushing blow. The victim takes considera­ ble damage, a maximum of 10-100 (lOdlO) points if the juggernaut is large and heavy. The victim may make a saving throw vs. death ray to take half damage, but success does not negate the crushing effect on items. 125 0.ajGiilAL ADVEil'f'VRJ;S REiilCARJIA'f'ED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EllTAL EVIL · . .. Appendix C: Magic Items GARGOYLE CLOAK GP Sale Value: 6,00 XP Value: 1,00 When donned, this garment polymorphs the user into a gargoyle, with effect as the polymorph self spell. No command word is used. Items carried are absorbed within the gargoyle form, unusable. Immunities, fly­ ing ability, and all other gargoyle character­ istics are bestowed. Armor Class is likewise altered, but is modified by the user's true Dexterity, magical effects, and protective devices worn or carried (but excluding mod­ ifications from armor and shield). The cloak's effects may be produced up to a maximum of three times per day. The polymorph occurs within 1 segment after the cloak is donned, without the sparkling lights usually accompanying a polymorph. After the first full tum of use, there is a 10% chance per tum (cumulative) of the wearer being mentally changed into a gargoyle as well. If this occurs, the user either attacks or flies off (just as would a real gargoyle). Only a wish or death can then return the victim to normal form. The cloak is easily damaged by any edged weapon, fire, and other hazards. If the wearer takes 20 or more points of damage from such attacks, consider the cloak destroyed. The cloak may be repaired magi­ cally (via limited wish or similar enchant­ ment) but not by normal means. As a final note, other cloaks of poly­ morphingmay be found. Each is designed to change the user into one specific creature. Each confers benefits and hazards in the manner given above-a full polymorph self (lacking only the spell's curative effects), with the given chance of permanent mental change as well. ICHOR Of INIDXICATION GP Sale Value: 90 XP Value: 500 This substance is a colorless syrup found in half- ounce vials. It can be mixed with a liq­ uid, applied to food, or simply ingested straight. The ichor dries when exposed to air, hardening in 1 tum. When a vial of the fluid is consumed, the user becomes greatly intoxicated within 1 round (se effects below). If more is then consumed, the user becomes comatose from the excess. A half-vial produces mild intoxi- cation, but lesser doses have little or no effect. One vial of ichor can be used to treat one apple-sized foodstuff (about 10 square inches of area) or any beverage. Effects of intoxication are summarized below. Note that all modifiers are penalties except for those affecting NPC Bravery and Morale. Recovery from intoxication simply requires time, and (if a Comatose condition results) sleep. The times needed are 2-4 hours for Mild, 4-6 hours for Great, and 7- 10 hours for Comatose.

Invisible runes are scribed upon its front; these reveal four command words. The first shrinks the box to a twelfth of normal size, with all contents likewise becoming minute. The weight of the shrunken chest, empty or filled, is 30 pounds. The second word causes the chest (if of normal size) to function as one upon which a Leomund's secret chest spell has been placed (but with no smaller replica necessary!). The third word causes the box to return to full size or normal place, as applicable. The fourth word causes growth to quadruple dimensions, with sides, top, and bottom of one foot thickness, huge cop­ per bands, and a weight of 1,200 pounds. POUCH OF HOLDING GP Sale Value: 4,00 XP Value: 800 (per pouch) These apparently normal leather or cloth pouches are found in groups of 3-6 (ld4 + 2) attached to a belt. Each pouch can hold 100 gp (or ten pounds weight) as if it were but 1 gp (or a tenth of a pound). However, noth­ ing larger than 1 x 2 x 3 inches can fit into a pocket, and the maximum cubic volume 126 capacity for a pocket is 3 x 6 x 12 inches. (Thus, vials of holy water would easily fit, but a dagger or wand would not, in most cases.) fRAGARACH GP Sale Value: 90,00 XP Value: 18,00 (plus scabbard value: 35,00 gp) This hefty steel broadsword bears a mighty enchantment. It was originally fashioned for a demigod of elsewhen, and eventually passed into the WORLD OF GREYHAWK"' Setting. It served well for a short time, all too soon falling into the hands of the minions of Chaotic Evil. It has been in their grasp for a decade or more, resting in hiding in the Temple of Elemental Evil, guarded by the worst of elemental grues. Fragarach means "The Answerer:' The sword is of Chaotic Good alignment. Any Lawful creature trying to grasp it takes 1-6 points of damage and falls senseless for 1-10 rounds. A Neutral creature holding it takes only 1-3 points and swoons for 1-4 rounds. In evil hands, Fragarach has no "to hit" bonus whatsoever; in Chaotic Neutral hands, it will strike but one opponent per round. The sword functions perfectly only for a Chaotic Good user. In such hands, its + 4 bonus always operates, and it will strike WAND Of A WONDER GP Sale Value: 10,00 XP Value: 6,00 Quite similar to its cousin, the ever-popular wand of wonder, this item produces strange and unpredictable results for users of any class or type. The exact effect produced in any single use is determined by a random ldlOO roll, with reference to the following chart. The wand uses 1 charge per function. It may not be recharged. Allow saving throws wherever applicable, vs. wands unless the effect suggests another category. The wand performs at 6th level of experi­ ence, as is normal for such devices, and all physical changes produced (growths, poly­ morphs, etc.) are dispellable at normal chances. 0NGiilAL ADVEilTV S REi ilCARJIATED • THE TEJb:PLE 0F ELEJb:EllTAL EVIL as many opponents unerringly as have struck at its possessor. Fragarach always hits all such targets, the + 4 pertaining to additional damage only. Note, however, that The Answerer always strikes last in a melee round. Against evil opponents, the bonus doubles (to + 8) whenever a natural 20 is rolled for "to hit" determination. The sword has a hilt of silver and gold wire, most cunningly wrought. Its guard and pommel are set with perfect emeralds (corundum)-7 gems, total value 65,00 gp. Its scabbard is likewise trimmed with pre­ cious metal and decorated with many gems of green and golden hue, worth another 35,00 gp. OTHER SWORDS OF ANSWERING GP Sale Value: 50,00 XP Value: 10,00 (plus scabbard: 16,00 gp) When Fragarach first came to this world, it received immediate attention and quick renown; so much so, in fact, that six other swords like it were forged and enchanted. These are lesser weapons, of course, and their alignments vary. Each has a + 2 bonus (and cannot hit opponents struck only by + 3 or better weapons). On a natural "to hit" roll of 1, no bonus applies; on a natural 20, like their predecessor, the bonus is dou­ bled (to + 4). These lesser swords are identi­ fied by the differing gems set in guard and pommel. They are reported to be amethyst, aquamarine, garnet, peridot, topaz, and tourmaline stones, with combined value of about 24,00 gp per weapon, 16,00 gp per scabbard. These weapons are named Rebut­ ter, Scather, Replier, Retorter, Squelcher, and Back-Talker, in honor of Fragarach. LENS OF TRANSFORMATION Artifact GP Sale Value: 22,500 This device is a sheet of cloudy crystal, 7 feet broad and tall and 3 inches thick. It was created by Iuz, who placed it in the dungeon for his own evil purposes. The crystal sheet appears cloudy from one side, but clear from the other. No detect spell works within 20 feet of it, except for detect magic, which reveals that a powerful dweomer is upon the crystal sheet, and (if the lens is activated) that a lesser magic affects the area within 20 feet of it. The lens is activated whenever any life force (living or undead) approaches within 3 feet of the clear side. The cloudy side of the lens then begins to brighten, its radiance 127 producing a continual light effect within one round. Viewed from the cloudy side, the users (those on the clear side) appear as the purest opposites of their actual forms. A paladin would appear demonic or diabolic; a Chaotic Evil monster might appear as a paladin, or as a deva, planetar, or solar. Additional visual effects (flames and smoke, sky and fluffy clouds, etc.) are auto­ matically produced as a background setting appropriate to the visual (false) form. Sub­ tle feelings (fear, peace, etc.) are likewise projected to the viewers of the illusion, allowing no saving throw (though innate total immunity to ESP negates the emo­ tional effects). The cloudy side of the lens quickly darkens when the user(s) back away from the clear side. The lens will function as often as desired. It is protected by a powerful and permanent force field, and is impervious to harm by anything less than a godling. Even passwall and glasse are useless against its mighty dweomer. Once mounted, as it is herein, it cannot be removed by a power lesser than Iuz', except for a wish-and even that may cause the lens to shatter in the attempt (a 25% chance). A final dweomer lets Iuz know if the lens is destroyed, and who did it. THE ORB OF GOLDEN DEATH Artifact GP Sale Value: 75,00 This item (a.k.a. Yellowskull, Goldenskull, or the Death Orb) is a powerful magic item created by Zuggtmoy and luz. Because of its nature and aura, no paladin will touch it willingly, nor will any Good cleric; they feel its immense innate Evil. The Death Orb is a gold sphere three inches in diameter, shaped to resemble a human skull sans lower jaw. Atop the crown is a raised diadem with depressions, the latter designed to accept four large gems, one representing each element. The Orb has only limited powers without these gems. Its possessor can, at will, detect lie, know alignment, and poison (as the reverse of a neutralize poison spell). The possessor learns directly from The Orb full details of usable powers, but no information about Charisma effects (explained below), potential powers (such as those gained by addition of gems), unfa­ vorable effects, nor the Orb's following pro­ tection ability. Neither Zuggtmoy nor luz can harm the possessor of Goldenskull, nor can either be the agent employing another to cause the user harm. 0JtjGiilAL ADVEilTVRJ;S REi ilCA.R._IlATED • THE TEDIPLE 0F ELEDIEilTAL EVIL If the possessor gazes upon the great throne in the Temple of Elemental Evil (upper level, area 3), he or she immediately knows how to operate it. The Throne can be caused to raise and lower itself, with the user, between the upper Temple works and dungeon level three (area 340). The user's Charisma with respect to Cha­ otic Evil creatures is raised to 20, or to -3 when angry. The corresponding effects apply, i.e. for Charisma 20, + 4S % Reac­ tion Adjustment, Maximum 2S Henchmen (all Chaotic Evil), 60% Loyalty Base, Awe Power affecting up to 2 Hit Dice or Levels; for Charisma -3, -SO% Reaction Adjust­ ment, Horror affecting up to 4 Hit Dice or Levels (again, only of Chaotic Evil crea­ tures). Those affected by Awe or Horror are stunned into inaction by the mere sight of the possessor (no saving throw), and (;annot initiate any action other than physical defense. Ill Efects: No Good ever results from the employment of the Death Orb's powers, except on a very short-term or temporary basis. Thus, if evil can result from any use of the Orb, that occurs along with whatever was actually done. For example, an elemental conjured to fight against some evil creatures will do so, but in such a way as to allow them to harm the conjurer's associates to a maxi­ mum extent. Also, each time the Awe Power is brought forth, the user actually loses 1 point of Charisma (but only with respect to those not Chaotic Evil). Both Zuggtmoy and luz know the iden­ tity and exact location of any person in pos­ session of Yellowskull (their detection ability overpowering any and all protec­ tions magical or mundane). The protection of the Death Orb notwithstanding, Zuggt­ moy and/ or Iuz can attempt to persuade or coerce the possessor to hand over the Orb (though they cannot take it by force). How­ ever, the possessor is forced to react to these Evil beings in a somewhat cooperative man­ ner, the degree corresponding to Charisma loss (from the use of the Awe Power)-a 10% chance of persuasion existing for each point so lost. In play, if the character does not naturally cooperate, roll d % to check the correct current chance, and privately inform the player if persuasion has occurred. Any character who actually gives the Death Orb to either Zuggtmoy or luz becomes the hopeless thrall of the appropri­ ate Evil being ever afterwards. (This perma­ nently removes the character from PC play.) The Elemental Power Gems The gems of the Orb, and additional powers they bestow, are as shown on the table. The four gems of the correct size and shape to fit the diadem of the Orb are hid­ den in the Elemental Nodes connected to the Temple of Elemental Evil. Each gem radiates a strong enchantment. When touched, a loose gem immediately transports all creatures within SO feet to the corresponding Elemental Node. No saving throw applies, and the victims arrive in the center of the Node map (q. v.). The gem tra­ vels with the victims. No other effect occurs, and no powers are bestowed. No effect occurs if a gem is touched while in its corresponding Node, but remember that the transport effect occurs elsewhere whenever the loose gem is touched. Repeat trips may thus occur before the possessor realizes that a container (ideally the Orb) must be used to prevent involuntary travel. When one of these gems is placed within its diadem mounting, the possessor gains the following abilities, and immediately realizes (and magically understands the process of) each of the effects. 1. The noted spell power, usable once per week. 2. Travel to and from the corresponding Element Gem Air Smoky quartz Earth Carnelian Fire Gamet Water Aquamarine 128 Elemental Plane at will (as if by using the teleport without error spell, but with no chance of error). 3. Comfortable existence in the corres­ ponding element or Elemental Plane, taking no environmental damage. 4. Conjure elemental once per week, sum­ moning from the appropriate Plane; however, no mental control is needed as long as the Orb is held (producing an effect much like the druid spells). The elemental is of small size (8 HD) but max­ imum hit points (64). (Note, however, that such summoning is NOT possible while on the same Elemental Plane. ) S. Summon and control a demon of the type noted up to 3 times per day, but never more frequently than once per hour (6 turns). Before the final assault on the Temple by the forces of Good, Zuggtmoy carefully hid the gems in their corresponding Elemental Nodes. She then entrusted the gemless Yel­ lowskull to her priesthood, while she faced the onslaught of those whose magic then trapped her in her own stronghold. Destroying the Orb: The Death Orb can only be destroyed if all of its gems are properly inset. It must then be subjected to the following effects, in quick succession and in the· proper order: a wind of SO or more mph force; the strike of a maul made from a solid piece of granite; a very hot flame (1,000 degrees F.); and immersion in very cold water (32 degrees F.). The procedure causes the Orb to shatter, which causes the Elemental Nodes and the Greater Temple (Dungeon Level Four, area 417) to collapse, and the dungeon levels above as well. Zuggtmoy takes 111 points of physical damage, is unable to use any powers for four days, and cannot leave her own Abyssal Plane for 40 years. luz, having less invested in the Death Orb, merely loses the services of evil elemental creatures for four years.

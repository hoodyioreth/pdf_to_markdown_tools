Some of you have visited the City of Greyhawk and the lands of the Flanaess before this, through the many adventures and accessories set in Greyhawki world. Some of you are newcomers to this setting, though you may have heard others speak of their experiences here. In either case, this PLyw's G i d e  book is designed to give you information about the land, the history, the races and the cultures that make the GREY HAWK^ campaign uniquely exciting. Several years have parsed since new game mate&& have seen print and much has changed, but the danger, mystery and adventures that have always been a part of this world are as prefent as ever - perhaps more so. Some material idthis book introduces - or reintrodut -you to the lands of the Flanaess, th northeastern corner of the immense continent of Oerik and home to the Free City and Domain of Greyhawk. Since it helps to know a little about the world in which your characters move, we'll update the history of the Flanaess to the current campaign year of 591 CY (Common Year): and we'll provide an overview of the geographical and political divisions in effect at this time. The races of Oerth, described in only sketchy detail until now, are given greater consideration so that players can understand what it feels like to play a Flan, Baklunish, Oeridian, Rhennee or Sue1 human. Other information will be directly useful in your roleplaying experience in Greyhawk: race and cultural information, notes for roleplaying representatives of specific groups, adventuring attractions, and even character kits unique to the lands surrounding the City of Greyhawk. The Pkyw's Guide book is by no means exhaustive. The GREYHAWK campaign was the first AD&D' game setting, and there exists a large body of m a t e d  (most of it out of print) describing the City of Greyhawk and the Flanaess. It officially began with the WORD OF GREYHAWK folio and boxed Set in the early'80s, set in the campaign year 576 CY, though many ADBID game adventures were set in this realm even before the setting rules came out. In the nearly two decades since publication of the folio, the world has been developed through scores of adventurer, accessories and articles. GEYHAWK boxed ret (TSR stock #1015,1983), the GREYHAWK Advmrurrr hardcover book (#2023,1988), Ihe City o j  C+hwk boxed set (#1043,1989), and the Fmm rhr Ashes boxed set (#1064,1992). None of these materials are required for play in the GREYHAWK setting, but those of you interested in reading them might find them in used book Stores, in secondhand sections of hobby and game stores, or at auctions at game conventions across the country. Future GREYHAWK products will develop Oerik in much greater detail. Time has passed on Oerth since the last GREYHAWK game materials were produced; in the years between 576 CY and the current campaign date, 591 CY, the Flanaess has seen great treacheries and greater wars. A few years ago, a widespread conflict called the Greyhawk Wars damaged the fabric of life here, perhaps irreparably; the treaty which was supposed to have ended the wars has been broken again and again, and borders everywhere are in turmoil. The corrupt and decayed Great Kingdom has finally fallen, but new realms have arisen to take its place - each with the potential to be even more evil than iu predecessor. A horrifying demigod has been freed from captivity; despite the loss of many of his fiendish troops, his expanded empire threatens the heart of the Flanaess. A mysterious brotherhood has reached out from its southern stronghold to begin a conquest of certain countries - a conquest that may not end until the Flanaess itself is destroyed. Armies of humanoids -brutish creatures with both human and bestial features - march across the 1and:Though some have been repelled, still there are lost lands to be won. Giants and creatures drawn from alien planer lay waste to civilization. Barbarians, assassins and monsters run rampant. Yet the Flanaess is alive and vibrant. The timer are more peaceful than they have been, and for many, life goes on as it always has - there are crops to be gathered, markets to visit, roofs to rebuild. Other, more adventurous types strike out against the enemies of civilization and order, uncover lost and forgotten treasures, and gain the resources they need to become the heroes and leaders of this exciting new time. There are captured realms to be retaken, artifacts to be rediscovered and used, and incredible lands beyond the Flanaess to explore. It is an age of adventure with no limit to what one person can achieve. Some of the material that follows is adapted and updated From the Worn OF Welcome to Greyhawk.

Some of it is m e ;  more is learned speculation; and still more is wild surmise. It is believed that there are four continents on Oerth, of which the largest is Oerk To the south and east of Oerik is the small continent of Hepmonaland. An ice-covered continent caps Oerth’s northern pole: it is known as Telchuria or any of a number of variations on the name High Boros. A large island to the east of Oerik is known as Fireland for the many volcanoes there. At the opposite end of the world from the Flanaess is a fourth continent, about which no more is known than that it exists. rest of the continent by the Dramidj Ocean and a string of towering mountain chains stretching from theyatils down to the volcanic Hellfurnaces; to the west of those are steppes and the horrific wastes of the sea of dust, where the ancient Balunish Empire once lay. Beyond these barriers, tales say, are great and ancient empires, mountains so tall that they dwarf the great Crystalmistr, and monsters of inconceivable horror. Further, the Flanaess is separated from the rest of Oerth by other natural barriers.To the north lies the dangerous Land of Black Ice and the aptly named Icy Sea: to the east the immense, storm-racked Solnor Ocean, raid to stretch over a thousand leaguer. To the southeast are the jungle and swamps of tropical Hepmonaland; due south is the huge Densac Gulf and the wild Amedio Jungle. Oeliki northeasternmost section is known as the Flanaess, which is isolated from the GHE FLANAESS vded with nations and groups of every p, and threaded through with roads waterways, the Flanaess is an object of m e  interest to its inhabitants, who see the center of enlightened humanity. e three thousand miles from east to , it offers immense variety, and, while ! is some interest in what lies beyond orders, most adventuresome find le opportunities for exploration within ,any lands. he variety extends to the area’s bitants, for there are many demihuman humanoid races scattered across the ass.

If an outside threat plagues the city, the citizens of Greyhawk are required by law to stand to her defense. The city prospered during the Greyhawk Wars. Refugees fled here to escape ravaged lands: among these thousands were great scholars, artists and wizards who offered their talents to the city’s defense and future. Humans, halflings, dwarves, gnomes and elves live under Greyhawk‘s banner, shielded by the city’s military might and lending their own weapons and skills to the army.

One of the strongest states in this region is the Kingdom of Furyondy, west of the Nyr Dyv. As Ferrond, Furyondy broke from the Great Kingdom three and a half centuries ago. Now, battered by the armies of Iuz since the Greyhawk Wars, it clings to its fieedom. Immediately west of Furyondy is the Archdericy of Velum, a theocracy upholding law, order and goodness. Veluna is perhaps monger than Furyondy, and it supports its eastern neighbor against their mutual enemy - even as it keeps an eye on Ket to the west. important are the Viscounty of Verbobonc, allied withveluna, and the elf-ruled Town of Highfolk, allied with Furyondy. South of Greyhawk‘s lands are several independent towns on the Wild Coast, some of which have fallen to humanoid armies from the Pomarj. The Kingdom of Celene is a powerful elven realm west of the Wild Coast. Long an ally of the Ulek states in their battles against humanoids in the Lortmils, in the recent wars this ancient state chose instead to stay isolated, refusing assistance to even iu staunchest allies. Such isolationism angers many elves here. Those who disagree with the policy secretly support Celene’r traditional allies with arms and money Several smaller independent cities and realms dot this region.

Cran March, Biwl, Valb $ the M q The fertile Sheldomar Valley is almost completely endosed by mountains, with the Azure Sea coast along the southeast border. Two great rivers, the Sheldomar and the Javan, feed this vast land. The Pomarj peninsula is counted as part of this area. The primary threat here comes from humanoid and giant marauders in the Crystalmist, Hellfurnaces and Barrier Peaks to the west, and the Orcish Empire of the Pomarj to the eat: several states have been invaded by these forces. The Hold of the Sea Princes is in turmoil; pare are under the control of the Scarlet Brotherhood in the south. After the wars that destroyed the Baklunish and Suloise Empires, demihumans and primitive Flan humans were joined here a millennium ago by Suloise and Oendian humans. At the center of this valley is the Kingdom of Keoland, the first major nation established here. East of Keoland are three demihuman states: the Duchy of Ulek (populated by elves and humans), the County of Ulek (humans, halflings and gnomes), and the Principality of Ulek (dwarves and humans). There are currently battling o m and goblins from the P o m j . To the north are the Gran March and BLsel, once part of Keoland’s northern border. Gran March has attracted rtfugees from B i d ,  Geoff and Sterich, and has a strong force of knights supported by a militant philosophy In recent years, Bissel was conquered by Ket, but has won free. One unusual spot here is the Valley of the Mage (orvale of the Mage) in the Barrier Peaks, controlled by the secretive, paranoid wizard Jaran Krimeeah. Gnomes and unusually tall elves live here, supporting the wizard and defending the valley against all visitors. In the east are Geoff and Sterich, once vassal states of Keoland, more recently overrun by giants and other hostile humanoids. While Sterich has been reclaimed, Geoff still remains a “lost land,” and most of the population lives in exile in neighboring kingdoms, preparing for a waz that will allow them to return home. South of Keoland is the Yeomanry, a democracy with longstanding military traditions. Almost everyone knows how to fight, which enabled it to ward off an invasion of giants and humanoids during the Greyhawk Wars. pirates, now torn by civil rebellion against the Scarlet Brotherhood, which invaded in 583 CY. In this region, Suloise background is dominant among humans, with strong Oeridian influence. Flan blood is strong in certain areas (Geoft Sterich and the County of Ulek) and strong Baklunish influence appears in Bissel and theValley of the Mage. 1, mnih :y IS bursting at the s~ams.

These temperate grassland, forest and coastal western lands were settled by survivors of the destruction of the Baklunish Empire a thousand years ago. Largely separated from the rest of the Flanaess by the Yatils, Barrier Peaks and Crystalmists, they remain a traditional stronghold of the Baklunish people. The empire's core lands are a mix of prairie and scrub desert called the Dry Steppes. Only horse-riding nomads ruled by khans inhabit the Dry Steppes, though one tribe has settled to create UU. The Steppes' northernmost extent, the Plains of the Paynims, is unoccupied during much of the hot summer: the nomadic residents are poorly armored but highly mobile and fierce. Baklunish nomads breed beautiful horses famed for speed and endurance. , Just to the north are the four major Baklunish states: Ket, Tusmit, the Caliphate of Ekbir and the Sultanate of Zeif. On the fringe of the Flanaess, they seem exotic to ' visitors from the east: buildings are lavishly ornamented with minarets and towers, and locals d r t s  in turbans and layered robes. Sailors from Zeif and Ekbir explore the Dramidj Ocean to the west. Caravans pass through Ket, which is located in a gap in the mountains between the Flanaess and the rest of Oerik.

The only organized state here is Perredand, a mountainous neutral nation. Perrenlanders (also called Perrendem) were originally warlike Flannae who absorbed all invading peoples. Now democratic and wealthy Perrenland is a major trading partner of Ket, Furyondy, Veluna and other states, and it is a source of mercenaries across the Flanaess.

Its inhabimts include remorhaz (insectoid monsters with furnacelike stomachs) and blue-furred bugbears. Here too are the ruins and dungeons of Bkdunoor, but despite legends of ancient treasure and magic, few people come to this frightening place. It is possible that in the long winter night the Land of Black Ice develops a wide ice bridge that leads to the polar continent of Telchuria.

His vast armies consist of OICS and hobgoblins, with other humanoids and many evil humans: IuiS lieutenants are nearly all evil spellcasters. The imperial capital is Dorakaa. During and following the Greyhawk Wars, he expanded his empire to include the former lands of the Rovers of the Barrens, parts of the Duchy of Ted, the Bandit Kingdoms, the Shield L a d s  and the Horned Saciecy, as well as the bizarre Rift Canyon and parts of the enormous Verve and Fellreev Forests. The empire's civilized neighbors all currently follow a policy of strict containment, building up massive defenses along their borders with Iuz.The major threat to this region is not external, despite raids along every border and a major conflict in Tenh. The empire is threatened by manpower and food shortages, poor disaibution of what few resources exist, and a completely chaotic and paranoid chain of command in which high-level commanders hoard mattrid for their private use while striving to undermine their peers.

TheThillonrian Peninsula to the far northeast is separated from the rest of the Flanaess by a string of mountain chains. The dimate is subarctic, with brief growing seasons, poor soil and conifer forests. There are reports of curious lights in the sky like colorful ribbons, stripes or flashes. The peninsula is daimed by the Ice, Snow and Frost Barbarians, people almost entirely descended from Suloise migrants of a few centuries ago. Strong Flan and minor other elements are present in Stonehold (formerly the Hold of Stonefist). All there people live in relative barbarism, putting to sea in longships to raid the coasts of other realms (and one another), or attacking overland in wild hordes.

The Old Aerdy region includes the vast temperate, fertile lands that were once a parr of the Kingdom of Aerdy, established in the eastern Flanaess seven hundred years ago. As it expanded and evolved and crowned its first Overking, the area was renamed the Great Kingdom. The western portion of this region is the Kingdom of Nyond, founded by a branch of the Great Kingdom's royal dynasty j u s  over two centuries ago.

islands, but what happens there, no mortal can say. The Lordship of the Isles declared the Scarlet Brothcthhood in 584 CY. Only a few dozen miles across theTilva Strait from theTilvanot Peninsula is the mi continent of Hepmonaknd. Hepmonaland is almost entirely unexplored, a tropical region where rain forests doak the land.The Scarlet Brotherhood has conquered part c northern Hepmonaland and imports the warriors it finds there (themselves of Suloise stock) to the Flanaess to fight for the Brotherhood. A second tropical region lies to the west of Hepmonaland, across the pirate- and monster-infested Densac Gulf. The Amedio Jungle’s northernmost part reaches into tl Azure Sea. Here, pirates and slavers from the Hold of the Sea Princes raided or trade with the jungle residents, until the Scarlet Brotherhood conquered the Hold and conducted its own raids. Ancient ruins and savage monsters fill the Amedio, which is c off from the rest of the world by the Azure Sea and Densac Gulf and by the volcanic Hellfurnace mountains to the west. The Brotherhood remains the greatest threat to th islands, Hepmonaland and the Amedio; hut the shipbuilding programs of the Great Kingdom of Northern Aerdy and the United Kingdom of Ahlissa are likely to create external threat within a decade. The Sea of Dust lies to the southwest of the Flanaess, across the Hellfurnaces ftor the Amedio Jungle. This ash desert is all that remains of the old Suloise Empire, also called the Sue1 Imperium, after the Rain of Colorless Fire about a thousand years ago. Portions of the Sea of Dust are navigable using special boats. This region is extremely hostile to humans, hut a strange ecology has developed, with rock-eating CE~NES, 9;” slugs, burrowing beasts and other monsters. Beneath the Hellfunaces and parts of the Crystalmists ate huge tunnels and cavern: that stretch underground for perhaps thousands of d e s .  Only a fraction of this subterranean realm has been explored by humans, who generally avoid the evil races that live here.This realm is called by some Under-Oerth. Its best-known feature is the gigantic city-cavern called thevault of the Drow, though a great underground river ani sea are rumored to exist as well. :LIMA= OF THE FLANAESS world of Oerth, local weather is strongly affected by magic, and it is possible that #en generates or controls the world's climate as well. Certainly, the Flanaess has an long summer and growing season, especially considering the world's large axial ch by rights should produce remarkable seasonal and climatic extremes. Certain nd their agents specialize in manipulation of the atmosphere, including winds, rain, heat and cold. Such manipulations are generally meant to keep the weather 21 to most worshipers of the gods, though the weather can also be used to punish ssors on a large scale. i cast by wizards and priests can have extraordinary effects on local weather , too, and new weather-altering spells are developed all the time. Some kingdoms Celene) appear to deliberately alter local conditions on a day-to-day basis the weather as pleasant as possible. However, there is concern that great or 2d weather changes using magic result in a baddash, altering conditions elsewhere vorld or even on other planes, particularly the elemental ones. Some areas of ,articularly over the seas, are savaged by storms of extreme violence, perhaps ingly driven by magic-use elsewhere. cd this, changes in climate on Oerth are closely related to latitude. In general, a ,f one degree of latitude will result in a difference of two degrees Fahrenheit in tux Thus, a wizard teleporting from the equator in the jungles of Hepmonaland xthernmost peninsula of the Land of Black Ice, about 60 degrees north should experience a sudden drop in temperature of roughly 120 degrees. Local ns alter this tendency. h a e s s ,  as noted, has an especially good growing season. Temperatures rarely fall eezing in that part of the Flanaess that is below 45 degrees north latitude the latitude of Perredand), except during the two winter months (Sunrebb and ) and early spring (Readying), and at night during late spring (Coldeven) and late (Readykat). Even in the depths of winter, rarely more than a week or two of :old weather is suffered, with gradual warming after. Summer lasts five or six in the central Flanaess, that area between 45 and 25 degrees north latitude, rutdy the latitudes of the Crystalmists. The climate here is temperate, with rare south of latitude 35 degrees (just south of Greyhawk). oasts usually receive more rainfall and remain cooler in the summer and Warmer inter than inland areas. Several areas have subtropical conditions, during which ners are relatively dry but winters bring considerable rain. These areas include 1 of the Sea Princes, the Pomarj, Onnwal, Idee, thevast Swamp, Dullstrand, the L Lordship of the Isles and the Spindrift Isles. cal conditions generally exist everywhere south of 20 degrees north latitude. in particular are the Amedio Jungle, theTilvanot Peninsula, the southern > of the Isles and all of Hepmonaland.

The Lormils and Glorioles have only ow-capped peaks. regions between 45 and 55 degrees north latitude (the latitudes of the Barrens and the lands of Iuz) count as subarctic, with cool, dry summers during which the ground thaws for only a few months. This region is very close to the Northern Border of Day and Night (as Oerthi arctic circle is called), north of which the length of day and night alter greatly.The Thillonrian Peninsula receives more rain and snowfall than interior areas such as the Barrens, Iuzi homeland and the land of the Wolf Nomads, which are cold steppeland with permafrost tundra farther north. Barbarians of the Thillonrian Peninsula practice limited agriculture. An exception to the above are those regions adjacent to the Dramidj Ocean, which is known for its unusually warm currents. Zeif, Tusmit, Ekbir and the western half of the lands controlled by the Tiger Nomads are all temperate, with respectable rainfall and the same growing seasons as the central Flanaess. Fog is Common in the winter here, as cold air from the north passes met the warm sea. Icebergs are often shrouded in fog. Prevailing winds in the Flanaess tend to be from the north and northeast in autumn and winter, and from the east and southeast in spring and summer. The wintry north wind is often called "Telchur's breath," after the Oendian god of the north, and the spring wind from the east is called "Atroab laugh," for the Oeridian goddess of the east and springtime. Mountain ranges and the like may alter tha. When they flow against high hills and mountains, moisture-laden winds from the east cool, causing rainfall. As the winds cross the hills and mountains, they warm up, retaining their moisture. Thus, the western side of many mountain ranges are dryer than the eastern side.This becomes especially apparent when looking at the west and east sides of the Barrier Peaks/ CrystaLnists/Hellfu~n~c~~ chain, though the western side is also more arid because of magical influences. Elsewhere, the Kingdom of Sunndi is wetter than the Ahlissan Principality of Naerie to the west, thanks to the Hollow Highlands, but is drier than Dullstrand and old Medegia, thanks to the Hestmarka.

' . y x * qp") Rise and F d  of the Great Kingdom After two centuries of war, the olive-skinned Oetidians dominated much of the Flanaess, dying with native Flannae and scattered demihuman enclaves against the Suloire and armies of rapacious humanoids, particularly ora. The Aerdi tribe of Oeridians established the Kingdom of Aerdy in the fir east which grew until it controlled most of the Flanaess, from Sunndi in the southeast to Ratik andTenh in the northeast, and westward as far as what is now Futyondy andVduna.This vast empire, called the Great Kingdom, lasted for three centuries. The first major crack in the Great Kingdom was the loss of theviceroyalty of Ferrond, which became the Kingdom of Fuqondy in 254 CY. Ferrond eventually split into the states of Furyondy andVeluna; the City of Dyers and other areas broke away later. In 356 CY, internal feuding ripped at the ruling Aerdi dynasty, the House of Rax. The junior branch, Nyrond, rebelled and dedared its lands ftee of the Overking's rule. A barbarian invasion in North Province prevented the Overking from punishing this, and eventually these lands became known as the Kingdom of Nyrond. Nyrond later went through an imperialistic phase, annexing and then losing the County of Urnst and the Pale. In 446 CY, repression and excessive taxation led to a general rebellion in the southern k a t  Kingdom. The city of Irongate was the first to secede, joined by the Idee, Onnwal nd (in 455 CY) Sunndi. (Later, the Lordship of the Isles joined the Iron League.) lperating from South Province and the See of Medegia, the armies of the Overking ried without success to regain the lost territories for over a century. Greater disaster was on the way. The House of Rax became decadent and weak, and ertain regions in the shrunken Great Kingdom were ruled by nobler of other houses as if hey were minor independent lungdoms. In the first half of the fifth century, the House tf Naelax destroyed the House of Rax in a conflict called theTurmoi1 Between Crowns, nd Naelax took the MalachiteThrone. A century later, the nobles of the House of qaelax are regarded as having been either insane or evil fiend-worshipers - or both. To the West iimultaneous to these events, the Kingdom of Keoland reached its zenith in the iheldomar Valley far to the west. Founded by Oeridian and Suloise tribes less warlike and nore tolerant than their fellows, Keoland grew rapidly until it ruled the entire region rom the Pomarj to the CrystaLnists. Its armies pressed into Ket andVeluna around 50-360 ci, but were later pushed out. Within a century, Keoland lost its frontier egions: the Ulek states, Celene, Bissel and the Yeomanry. Keoland relinquished its mperial ambitions and stabilized, with the semi-independent lands of Gran March nd Sterich supporting its army. While the Great Kingdom and Keoland grew and shrank, other parts of the Flanaesr ere taking shape. During the late third century, Baklunish horse barbarians claimed much Nf the northern steppes. A hundred yean later, the Sea Princes and Bandit Kings looted nd pillaged their way to political autonomy About 375 CY, the Free City of Greyhawk eached its first period of greatness under the leadenhip of Zagig Yragerne.

Iuz had scaped magical imprisonment beneath Greyhawk Castle in 570 CY and returned to his lomelands. By pretending to be their godVatun, he mcked the northern barbarians of he Thillonrian Peninsula into attacking the Hold of Stonefist. He apparently gained nagical control over Stword Redbeard, the evil Master of the Hold, and used the Fists as the Stoneholders are called) to sweep into Tenh in 582 CY. When Iuz as Vatun tried o pressure the northern barbarians to attack Ratik, they balked, due to the longstanding Iliance between the lands. Iuz then hurled his armies into the Horned Society, Shield .an&, Bandit Kingdoms and even Furyondy The Great Kingdom, under the insane ulerrhip of Ivid V, chose this time to attack Nyrond and Ahor. The turmoil in the Great Kingdom turned into mad chaos, as the r e u s  own provinces were despoiled and ruined. An army of giants and humanoids conquered Geoff and Sterich. After its beygraf signed a meaty with Iuz, Ket attacked and conquered Bissel. A half- OIC namedTurrosh Mak arose in the Pomarj and led orc and goblin armies to conquer the southern half of the Wild Coast and half of the Principality of Ulek.

From the Greyhawk Wars to the Present Seven years have passed between the signing of the Pact of Greyhawk and the present day, 591 CY - seven years of change and conflict. While the history of this tumultuous period will be covered in detail in The Advmtwr Bcgini accessory (#9577, I998), this hook offers a brief catalog of events to bring players up to date. The Return of the Eighf: In mid-585 CY, the Circle of Eight was brought back to its full numbers. This brought hope to the hearts of many residents of the Flanaess, as did the news that one of the assassinated members of the Eight, Tenser the Archmage, had been brought back to life. However, Tenser left the Eight and now follows his own course in protecting the Flanaess. The Flight of the Fiends: In Coldeven of 586 m, many of the demons in the Flanaess were banished by Veluna's Canon Hazen (a priest of Rao), the archmage Bigby and others. They used a powerful artifact known as the Crook $ Rao, retrieved some years before from a demiplane where it had been lost. This decimated the armies of Iuz, which relied heavily on demons, and gave beleaguered Furyondy the chance for a counteroffensive.

Celene remains officially neuttal; the Valley of the Mage remains a puzzle. Following the assassination of its beygraf, Ket has largely withdrawn from B i d ,  though Thornward now marks Keti eastern border. It is now 591 N. While the Flanaess s t d suffers from internal disputes and battles, times are slightly more stable than they have been. Nations and individuals sdll fight for &eedom and survival against threats old and new; but some are able to focus their attention elsewhere - even beyond the borders of the Flanaess.

Only the most significant and widely celebrated religious '5 are given here. In addition, each religion has its own set of holy days in addition list, and each city and town celebrates its own secular holidays, most of them of importance elsewhere. :scThis frigid seven-day period marks the transition from one calendar year to r, and it is usually accounted as the start of the new year. In many areas in the Flanaess, the week is spent feasting, drinking, dancing, gift-giving, putting up nd decorations, and in revelry Many religions celebrate midwinter with good charity, or observations of the sky. Various civic government functions take place this time, as well. evening of Needfest Godsday is also known as Midwinter Night.

Offerings to shrines to Telchur (the Oeridian the north and winter) are also made, praising his work but suggesting he go o the pole and sleep. Local druids and their small congregations also hold this acted, but little is known of their activities. Many farmers and herdsmen mark :ht as the m e beginning of spring, though Readying 1st is the calendar date for i start. ISC In Greyhawk, Growfest is not taken as a week-long public holiday, though it ded as a time of good cheer with the full arrival of spring.

While certain religious groups spend the night observing the skies for portents (or d i n g advantage of its darkness for acts of evil or thievery), many ordinary folk light all- night bonfires. Brewfest Only the first and last days of Brewfest (Starday and Freeday) are public holidays in the City of Greyhawk, meaning that no one can be coerced to work, and public revelry is encouraged by the government. However, many citizens take this fall celebration of the last harvest completely to heart, and public intoxication is common. The city takes on a circus atmosphere, and the stteeu are filled with actou, jugglers, acrobats, animal and monster trainers (with their best “pets”), and grinning adventurers showing off their latest trophies. The festival is celebrated throughout the central Flanaess. bNCUAGES Despite the great size of the Flanaess, only six tongues are recognized as actual languages: Flan, Suloise, Ancient Baklunish, Old Oeridian, Common and the Rhennee cant. Rhennee is considered less important in the Flanaess than the other five. A number of dialects exist, but there are not considered languages due to their close similarity to the major languages or their limited numbers of speakers. The foremost authority on languages in northeastern Oerik is Revort Leyhar at the Grey College of the University of Greyhawk. His 44-volume work, L..g.is # Lintistit Uragr b~ the Fhnms Ptoplri. examines each language and dialect in painstaking detail. A brief summary follows. Major Languages Flan: The language of the original nomadic peoples of the Flanaess, Flan is the oldest language still spoken in modern times. The current version of Flan, spoken by theTenhas, has changed considerably from the original. Despite these changes, the language is stagnant and inappropriate for describing modern concepts and technology. The vocabulary and syntax are not nearly flexible enough to express ideas and objects that were unknown to the original speakers. SuIoise:The tongue of the Suel peoples, this language is all but dead, thanks in large part to the Rain of Colorless Fire. The only known modern speakers of Suloire are the members of the Scarlet Brotherhood (where it is the only language permitted within its hierarchy), and the lawyers of Greyhawk. Others who study Suloise do so primarily as a written language in order to study the ancient tomes of the Suel people. Ancient Baklwish:This language survives among the Paynim tribes and certain dans in Zeif, Turmit and others. It is always used in formal addresses and commercial dealings. Baklunish is one of the roofs of modern Common. Old Oeridian: One of the “younger” languages in the Flanaess, Oeridian was believed to be a p u e  tongue (having changed very little wet the centuries) until Revort Leyhar proved otherwise. In his essays, Leyhar poinu out that a language as widespread as Oeridian could not have remained free of outside influences. Oeridian is still widely used in the lands of the former Great Kingdom, and is used almost exclusively by scribes, lawyers, clerks and similar professionals. Their critics maintain that the only reason these people still use the old tongue is to exclude speakers of “mere” Common and to maintain a monopoly on their professions. Libraries and archives are filled with official documents and ancient tomes written in Oeridian. Common:The newest language spoken in the Flanaess, Common is a blend of Old Oeridian and Ancient Baklunish. It is the most widely spoken language in Greyhawk, even among native speakers of other tongues. Anyone who plans to travel across national or cultural boundaries understands the need to speak at least some Common. This language evolved, in part, from the need for translations; certain languages cannot be translated directly to other languages. Common forms the bridge, allowing a language to be translated first into Common, then into the target language. It has become the universal language for trade and diplomacy. Rhennee CaneThough usually ignored in mmr writings on languages, Rhennee cant was studied by Revort Leyhar in some detail, using means he does not describe. He did not group it with other Flanaess languages, instead stating that its roots were of unknown origin but that it was a complete language, not a true “cant.”The privare language of the Rhennee has great flexibility and has incorporated many terms and phrases from other Flanaess tongues, particularly Old Oeridian and Common, with many specialized terms borrowed from mariners and thieves. Because this language has so few speakers (only the Rhennee) and may come from another world entirely, it is not considered one of the five q7true’’ tongues of eastern Oerik. Minor Dialects Ferral: An Oeridian tribal language, F e d  is now a guarded secret. It is spoken only by officials of the Iron League, and is used primarily for commands and purposes of identification. It is not a true living language, and amounts to little more than a code - a set of signals and labels. Most expressions are discrete: Ferral does not have the capability to mix elements to form new concepts. Npndese: Common is the basis for this dialect, which adds elements from an Oeridian tribal tongue. It is used in Nyond, primarily by peasants and shopkeepers. Fruz (the Co1dTongue):This dialect is primarily Suloise with Flan influencer. It is spoken by the Frost, Snow and Ice Barbarians. Even fluent speakers of Suloise find it hard to comprehend. Velondi: Used only in isolated areas of Veluna and iu northern borders, this is an Oeridian tribal tongue with no written form. Keolandish: Spoken in Keoland and surrounding areas, this is a dialect of Old 15 s are noticeable from village to village. obscure dialect of Suloire was used only in the Spindrift Isles but is is time.

Ewerd Destron, the szek of Onnwal before the Greyhawk Wan, L 3rese. became "Elve&; Duke Karll of Urnst became "Karl": and the mysterious Mage of thevale, Jaran Knmeeah became "Jason Krimeah" in several sources. Misspellings can be repeated unknowingly in later works, causing carehil scholars to pull out their hair. The actual name of the Lord Mayor of the City of Greyhawk, for instance, is Nerof Gasgol, but when his last name is pronounced the ''0'' sounds like an "a" (Gasgal), and that is what everyone thinks his name is when they wtite it out. He has long ago given up q i n g  to correct the error, so it remains Gasgal herein. Old names may change, but they never die. Nyrond was once known as "Nehron," after the Oeridian bibe that settled there, and the latter spelling shows up even today. (Nehron eventually became Nyrond, the m e

of a noble house allied with Rax until Nyond declared independence.) The Hold of Stonefist is now Stonehold, but many call it by its old name: its inhabitants, once called Holden or Stonefisterr, are now Stoneholders (or Fists, though this properly means only the war bands). Northern Aerdy and the United Kingdom of Ahlissa have alternate names: many still call this region "the former Great Kingdom," regardless of the current political situation. No one is sure what to call the regions once known as the Duchy of Tenh and the Hold of the Sea Princes, given their civil chaos and internal military conflicu. The Duchy of Geoff, invaded by giants and humanoids almost a decade ago, is std called that by w q o n e  except the invaders. Murlynd, the most peculiar hero-god known, was called Merlund or something simikr during his mortal life; variant spellings appear in many works. Zagyg the demigod is ofren called the Mad Ar&ge or identified by his mortal name, Zagig Yragerne. The castle &gig built is vaiously called Castle Greyhawk, Greyhawk Castle, the ruins of Greyhawk, the Greyhawk ruins, the dungeons of Greyhawk, Lgig's Folly and 50 forth. In short, the nomenclature of the Fknaess is like everything else in this fascinating land: vivid, varied and full of surprises. Sdarly, the Great Kingdom of ie to Greyhawk 16 THE FLANAESS RUNES AND GLYPHS 17 , The GREYHAWX campaign LS home to *&fqiJV many of the most powerful and dangerous beings anywhere. The deities of the Flanaess demonstrate great strengths; some, such as Vecna, have affected other planes profoundly Certain great mortals have ascended to become demigods or hero-gods and their names ring across time and space: Zagyg, Keoghtom, Murlynd, Vecna. Still other mortal wizards, villains, thieves and heroes have had such an impact that in a hundrrd universes great spells and magical devices bear their names: Mordenkainen, Iuz, Bigby, Drawmij, Heward, Iggwilv, Tenser, Acererak, Nystul, Tuerny, Ehlisra, Otiluke, Serten, Bucknard, Sustarre. These people made the Flanaess the greatest of GODS nmm POWERS The gods and powers of the Flanaess are an often-confusing mix of deities from a handful of cultures, representing natural powers and human attributes, virtues (and vices), and mental and emotional states. . In such an environment, the powerr and attributes of some gods overlap. Certain others, generally demigods or hero-gods, are once-mortal heroes (or villains) who have attained godlike powers. one or two primary gods, but their worship is by no means exclusionist. The people of the Flanaess are pragmatists, and they willingly embrace as many gods as necessary to make their lives run more smoothly. While a farmer may worship the old Flan goddess Beory as the Oerth Most humans and demihumanr worship Mother, he may also offer money or tribute to the Sue1 god Phyton to bring fertility to his fields. More than this, whenever the farmer strays into nonagricultural endeavors, he may very well offer tribute to the god or gods appropriate to whatever he is doing. For instance, if he travels to the City of Greyhawk to sell his products in the market there, he may at different times during his trip offer tribute to Fhadanghn (god of roads), St. Cuthbert (god of honesty),Velniur (god of weather) and Zilchus (god of money). A lot of this "worship" will look perfunctory, like tossing coins into a fountain for luck, but it will be no less genuine for that. The people of the Flanaess feel their gods are real and can take concrete action on the material plane. This feeling isn't changed by the fact that the most powerful gods rarely involve themselves directly with happenings on Oerth, St. Cuthbert being an occasional exception to this. In the GREYHAWK setting, gods are able to grant spells to their clerics and specialty priests, at the following levels: * Greater/Intermediate Gods: Clerics get up to 7th-level spells (with Quest spells from * Lesser Gods: Clerics get up to 6th-level spells unless deity lives on Oerth (example: the Tome $Magi< book only for Greater gods). Fharlanghdr prierto can get up to 7th-level spells, as he lives on Oerth, but no Quest * Demigods: Clerics get up to 5th-level spells unless the deity lives on Oerth, in which * Hero-gods: Clerics get up to 4th-level spells unless the deity liver on Oerth, in which * Quasi-deities: No spells gained; no priests available. . Imprisoned gods: Tharizdun, Vatun and Vecna are imprisoned. Their priests get up to spells). case 6th-level spells can be acquired (examples: Iuz and Wastri) case 5th-level spells can be acquired. 2nd-level spells only. Following is a table describing certain human gods in the Flanaess. This is not a comprehensive list, even for humans, and includes very few demihuman or humanoid gods. While the Baklunirh have many gods, only a few are relevant to the Flanaess and are mentioned here. Name: Deity's accepted proper name. Origin: The ethnic group/human race with which the deity is usually associated. B Baklunish; F Flan; 0: Oeridian; S: Suloire; U Unknown/mysterious origin; E: Elven; H Humanoid; C / c :  Commonly accepted across the Flanaess in many regions and cultures, and actual origin is irrelevant. The lower case "c" indicates a deity is less accepted and worshipped but is still widely known. Deities that are not commonly accepted (no "c" or "c") are worshipped primarily in areas settled by the listed ethnic group (for example, Ospremi shrines and temples are likely found only in areas where 18 Player's Guide to Greyhawk "I- -_ - THE HIGH AND MIGHTY 2-2- the Suloise have settled: in this case, along seacoasts). Some deities have very limited worship, though their names might be widely known: this is particularly true of extremely evil gods such as Tharizdun and Vecna.

These nine wizards serve as unofficial “watchdogs” on the continent, monitoring Oerik far trouble. Because most members are neutral in alignment, the group is concerned with maintaining balance in its world and not allowing any faction to become too powerful or overwhelming. In recent years, however, as evil forces have threatened to to contain these ever-growing evils. Nystul, Otiluke, Otto, Rary of Ket and the archmageTenser. During the Greyhawk Wars, two members of the Eight, Tenser and Otiluke, were killed as a result of the actions of Rary of Ket, now known as Rary theTraitor.Tenser was returned to life in 585 CY (during IAt Return .f the E$ adventure [#9576,1998]), but chose not IO return to the Circle of Eight. Otiluke is still dead. Three new members were appointed in 585 CY: Alhamazad the Wise, Theodain Eriason and Warnes Starcoat. The three former members are listed here. following the members of the Eight in 591 CY. All members of the Circle of Eight possess or have access to large numbers of magical items, particularly potions. They might be approached for assistance on a quest, requesting little more than a full report of the journey or an errand in return. Any of the members of the Circle of Eight might be contacted by leaving a message at the Wizards’ Guildhall, Otto5 home in the Garden Quarter or Jallaai Sallavarian’s home in the High Quarter of the City of Greyhawk. The members of the Circle of Eight have fast communication with each other through various magical devices. seize control of the land, the Circle of Eight has worked on the side of good in order In the early 580s, the Circle of Eight included Bigby, Drawrnij, Jallarzi Sallavarian, sr, ’y q.3 Mordenkainen Mordenkainen is an extremely powerful archmage who appears middle-aged hut is much older. He has cmpped bladr hair, brown eyes, and a black b e d  streaked with silver. A brilliant thinker, Mordenkainen feels responsible for the Flanaess and manipulates political and military events to suit his vision of what the Fknaesr should be. , but he also travels disguised as a merchant to learn facts on his own. The Citadel houses Mordenkaineds unequaled spell (except those designed continent, and a detailed and dTenser know of his home's Alhamazad the Wise Alhamazad became a member of the Circle in 585 CY and thus is one of the newest members of the Circle. A thin, elderly Baklunish man in plain robes and a simple turban, he looks like a poor wanderer during his frequent travels. He is in fact highly powerful as a mage, and has forged alliances with noble elementals and genies. His primary goals are the maintenance of modern Baklunish culture, society and power. A detailed character description is included in &&turn oj thc Eight adventure (#9576,1998). Bigby Bigby is a lean, severe-looking man with brown hair and eyes who prefers dark gray hooded robes. At 57 years of age, he is known for being cautious, quiet, nervous and puritanical. Though a fault-finder and nitpicker, he is steadfast and has a fine sense of humor. Bigby lived in Onnwal, but fled after the Scarlet Bmtherhood conquered it. He now lives in the city of Mitrik in Veluna. He adventures only infrequently, preferring to remain at home in one of his libraries or tinkering in his laboratory. Only when he gets wind of rare spell components or unusual magical items will he go adventuring, but he visits his wizard friends frequently He nearly killed Iuz once and is greatly hated by the demigod: in 590 CY, he survived an assassination attempt by Iuz's agents. Drawmij Despite his age of 63 years, Drawmij is tall, slim and young-looking, with dark blond hair and deeo blue eyes, which contribute to make him areuablv the best lookine male - ,

af the Eight He is secretive and says little even to fellow members of the Eight. He is a dedicated foe of the Mage of theValley.The mage makes his home in an underwater lair located at least a hundred miles offshore in the Azure Sea. As might be expected, Drawmij is an expert with magical devices involving water (he has a number of magical boats) and in adapting spells to underwater use. He visits the City of Greyhawk only when he must. Jallarzi Sallavarian The only woman in the Eight and one of the few leaning more toward goad than neutrality, Jallarzi offers a much-needed fresh perspective on matters put before this curmudgeonly men's club. Even at the age of 42, she remains beautiful, with blonde hair and bright blue eyes. Jallarzi has been a member of the Circle of Eight for just over nine years: she truly enjoys her membership and uses her other affiliations to benefit the Circle whenever possible. The wizard makes her home in the City of Greyhawk and will entertain visitors there, but she prefers to hold meetings at the Guild of Wizardry. She is also known to disguise herself and creep through the seedier areas of town in order to spy on the shady side of society. Her familiar is a pseudodragon named Edwina. Nystul This wizard's appearance is that of the stereotypical absentminded mage. Tall, gangly, and plain, Nystul has brown hair that looks as if it has never met a comb in all his 52 years. He has become a master of disguise to conceal his ridiculous appearance, and frequently travels under the guise of a half-elven maiden to gain assistance fiom paladins and knights. Nystul has a special interest in spells involving light and darkness. He is also an expert in the use of concealing and defensive spells, claiming that a wizard who finds himself in hand- to-hand combat has not used his arsenal of spells properly. Nystul visits Greyhawk on occasion, but is occupied with the war in his homeland of Tenh. He is always on the lookout for discovered spellbooks and magical items. Otto Otto was once a priest of Boccob, the god of magic, hut is now a major wizard and a member of the Circle of Eight, One of the younger membets at age 53, Otto is also one of the most colorful. Otto often poses as a rich, cheerful merchant, but he is easily picked out in a crowd because of his huge girth and his ruffled and beribboned clothing. He is a gourmet constantly in search of new, exotic dishes to sample, and is a patron of the arts. He has a natural talent for music and adds musical elements to his spells, which include singingjrcballc and yodeling iir stwmr. Once a native of Almor far to the east, Otto has moved to the City of Greyhawk following the complete destruction of his country He can be found visiting the opera house, the Wizards' Guildhall or his fellow Circle members. Theodain Eriason The first demihuman to join the Circle in 585 CY, Theodain is a tall, slim high elf with long bkck and silver hair, high cheekbones and a pale complexion. His manner is cold, and he often seems disdainful ot even evil, but he is in fact a passionate defender of regional stability, since such order protects his homeland, the Yeomanry. Theodain is unusual in that he is able to use a short sword despite being a wizard. He shows no compunction in attacking foes directly. A detailed character description is included in Thr Return oj the Eight adventure (#9576,1998). Player's Guide to Gmyhawk 22 THE HIGH AND MIGHTY Warnes Starcoat Warnes Starcoat joined in 585 CY to become one of the newest members of the Circle, a middle-aged man with a bald spot in his long blond hair and piercing pale eyes. He has a long-standing interest In the politics of the central Flanaess, particularly the County and Duchy of Umst. He was involved in the recovery of the Crook .f Rao.

Basmajian Arras The Commander of the Sea Barons is a middle-aged copper-haired man, survivor of decades of piracy, ship-to-ship battles and assassination attempts. Arras kept the Sea Barons out of the Greyhawk Wars and favors neutrality, though there are concerns about the Sea Barons' ability to stay neutral in the face of recent shipbuilding efforts by the Great Kingdom of Northern Aerdy, which may allow Aerdy to attack. He lives . Belvor IV The paladin King of Furyondy saw his nation lose land but survive against the armies of Iuz during the Greyhawk Wars. In 586 CY, he disregarded the Pact of Greyhawk to drive back Iuz's forces and reclaim the lost territory. He used much of his family's wealth to finance this war, and even now struggles to recover financially. _ Cobb Darg The Lord High Mayor of Irongate is a wily old man named Cobb Darg, A political genius with an unmatched grasp of intrigue, Cobb Darg was not fooled by the agents sent into his realm by the Scarlet Brotherhood, and he had them all slain or expelled. He is a familiar figure to his loyal human and dwarf subjects, but almost nothing is known of him personally.

The Canon of Vel- is a priest of Rao, god of reason, with exceptional spellcasting abilities. Hazen leads one of the strongest realms remaining in the Flanaess. In 586 c(, he worked with lesser priests and the archmage Bigby to drive out most of the fiends from the Flanaess using the Cmok oJRao. He also supported Furyondy's attack on Iuz's lands. He seeks to return balance to the Flanaess. Hazendel The King of Sunndi is a multitalented gray elf. At once wizard, priest and warrior, Hazendel is politically wise, listening to counsel from the elves, gnomes, humans and dwarves who harmoniously populate his isolated realm. Hazendel's worst enemies are the Scarlet Brotherhood (which has tried without success to subvert the realm from within) and the attentions of the United Kingdom of Ahlirsa (which seeks to incorporate Sunndi into its new empire). Iuz the Old The child of the human female necromancer Iggwilv and the powerful demon Graz't, Iuz gained control of a small re& in the Howling Hills a little over a century ago, expanding its borders in a campaign notable for its horrific massacres. For shy-five years. Iuz was imprisoned beneath Castle Creyhawk by an alliance of adventuren (indudmg the Mad Ardynage Zagig), possibly with the assistance of an avatar of St. Cuthbert.

Eclavdra Edavdra's name is whispered wherever the deeds of the drow are discussed. An evil priestess of the spider goddess Lolth, Edavdra is nonetheless one of the most diplomatic of the dark elves. She is involved in dozens of plots being hatched by Lolth, all aimed at the eventual conquest of the Flanaess and the enslavement of its people. Her home is a great drow city in a cavern beneath the Hellfurnaces. She currently keeps an eye on Iuz, hut her plans are mysterious. Grenell When the North Province dedared itself to be the new Great Kinedom of Northern " Aerdy, its former Herzog became the new Overking. An evil high priest of Hextor with little value for human life, Grenell is nonetheless a master politician and survived the Greyhawk Wars and the Great Kingdom's collapse without being captured, slain or turned into an undead monster.

Lynwerd After his Gather Archbold IU's abilcation, Lynwerd assumed the &ne of Nyrond in 586 CY. He strengthened hs c o u n q  by restructuring the military, by encouraging births among his people and by resisting a demand by representatives of theTheocracy of the Pale to give up the North Lands of Nymnd. Despite financial reverses and personal tragedy, he has been able to expand and stabilize Nymnd's eastan borders, and to repair and smnghen his kingdom's roads, armies, cities and trade links. Lyzandred Well over a thousand years old, the legends of the wil lich L y a n h d  make him the equivalent of a b o g e y  in many parts of the Flanaess. He is wen more hghtening to those who know the m t h  - that Lyzandred was once a living, breathing creature and that he lies in a self-made prison somewhere in the Abbor-Ah mountains. Lyandred's tomb holds a reputation as one of the most dangerous dungeons on the continent No matter how experienced, some adventurers shun the thought of exploring the lost tomb. Obmi 3. A sociopathic assassin and expert warrior, Obmi is a bladt-bearded dwarf with a magical ' * *p"' throwing hammer. He kills prisoners at the fint sign of disobedience, laughs at massacres and has unbearably foul personal habits. It is said that his injuries heal in minutes, and he can come back to life even if slain.

Ogon Tillit Korenth Zan, Father of Obedience The Supreme Prelate of the Pale is a gnm, humorless high priest of the god Pholtus. His Worshipful Mercy Tillit actually has little mercy, regarding everyone outside of his theocracy as degenerate heretics or worthless heathens. Tillit's army is very strong: in recent years, he has invaded portions of Tenh and continues to war there. Little is k n m  of the leader of the Scaclet Brotherhood though he is pmbably of Suloise ancestry He is evil natured, which is dearly demonstrated by the means used by his olganlzation to gam control of pivotal nations in the Flanaess. This b&mt mystic master, perhaps a high priest, may reside on the huge Philidor, The Blue Wizard Philidor is an enigma, a wizard of tremendous power who first appeared toward the end of the Greyhawk Wars. Regardless of how he otherwise changes his appearance, his skin, 25 hair, eyes and clothing always remain shades of blue. He has been seen in many places in the Flanaess, particularly in the Vesve Forest and the City of Greyhawk, though not in ‘g I ; recent years. Prince Brightflame Melt Prince Brightflame, i s  a cousin of Celene’s queen,Yolande. Melf is a brilliant and knowledgeable elf, a fighter/wizard like his cousin, but his better grasp of the dangers the Flanaerr faces has led him to found and declare himself the leader of the Knights of Luna, who seek to involve Celene in the larger world. He knows many powerful rulers and wizards and he works to oppose evil eveyuhere. Currently he lives in exile, sometimes in the City of Greyhawk. Sevvord Redheard The grim, bloodthirsty Master of Stonehold is a warlord with almost unparalleled experience. Ruthless and savage, he led troops to conquer, loot and occupy Tenh, though he now fights Iuz$ forcer and the Theocracy of the Pale to retain his claimed territory. . Stonehold currently suffers from attacks by the Snow, Ice and Frost Barbarians. Lord Robilar A powerful but unstable Warnor, Lord Rob& is treacherous, unwtworthy and a liar. He is responsible for freeing the archfiend Z u g p o y  from imprisonment, and on a separate occasion, he was a member of the entourage that set out to free and destroy Iuz from hs prison beneath Castle Greyhawk. I u  escaped, and it is quite possible that Robilair god was not to M1 Iuz, but to somehow enslave or ally with him As a result of the bade that h o s t 9 lulled h m ,  Iuz has vowed revenge on Robilar. ’ serves R a y ,  using a wide variety of magical weapons and devices such as an artificial Robilar was Rary’s accomplice in the deaths of Tenser and Otiluke in 584 CY.

He united his -es and conquered part of the Wild Coast and the Prin6pality of Ukk, but he cannot afford to go farther without risk of seeing hs command collapse from intertribal conflicts. , , r/ ., . Xaene the Accursed Before the Greyhawkwan, Xaene was the court wLard of IvidV but was replaced at the mad Overlunei whim. Xaene went into hiding and studied nmomanq, but hs misuse of an evil ” - artifact caused him to be c u e d  to become a two-headed lich of homifying power. Xaene is rumored to have aided the Overking’s descent into madness. He is believed to be destroyed. Xavener I The first Overking of the United Kingdom of Ahlissa is the head of House Darmen, which has near-total control over mercantile activity in the realm. The Royal Guild of Merchants of Aerdy was formed by this house to manage its trade interests, and the guild today pours vast funds into Xavener’s treasury. Little is known about Xavener except what his court tells others. He is a superb leader and wry charismatic, but his enemies do not seem to survive long in Ahlissa, and it is apparent that some of his aider fear him very much. Yolande The Queen of Celene is not currendy popular with many of her &en subjects. She has taken to heart her advisors’ plans to keep Celene free of the power struggles across the Player‘s Guide to Greyhawk Flanaess, which has caused some of her subjects to secretly turn against her. Yolande is a gray elf, both a skilled warrior and wizard of extraordinary age and power -but, sadly, limited wisdom. Many other Aaractm exist in this campaign, but their whereabouts and plans are known to no one. Some may be dead, others may have fled to other worlds or planes; but one or more of there beings may return to the Flanaess. The demigod Zagyg was once the human wizard Zagig Yragerne, the “Mad Archmage” who ruled the City of Greyhawk for many decades and built Castle Greyhawk, now in ruins on the city’s outskirts. Zagyg has a twisted sense of humor, as those who have explored Castle Greyhawk (and returned alive and sane) can test+ He was involved in the capture of I- many decades ago. Zagygb allies over the years have included a number of adventurers who achieved unimaginable levels of personal power. These fellows still think of themselves as friends of Zagyg, though no one has the faintest idea where he is. Heward, inventor of the Mystical Organ that produces wild magical effects with each note, is a retiring bard and wizard who has visited many worlds beyond Oerth. Keoghtom is a devil-may-care hero fond of exploring the Outer Planes and tormenting the evil lords there. Murlynd is perhaps the most unusual hero of them all, a holy warrior and wizard who mixes technology and magic to defeat his foes; he dresser like a cowboy and even uses firearms. These individuals are rarely seen in the Flanaess. Recently, Keoghtom and Murlynd ascended to hero-god status, and they now have clerics. Vecna is as well known as L g y g ,  but his dreaded name is not spoken aloud for fear of arousing him. Once the most powerful undead wizard of any known world, Vecna was destroyed at the height of his power by his treacherous lieutenant 26 THE HIGH AND MIGHTY Kas. Only Vecna's withered Hand and jeweled Eye survived, possessing frightening powers that can corrupt even the purest soul. Vecna attempted to return and conquer Oerth only a few years before the Greyhawk Wars and he nearly succeeded. Before his defeat, a servant of his was briefly able to slay the entire Circle of Eight. A Vecna cult survives, attempting to bring him back. Other notorious personalities include Iggwilv, the necromancer-witch who gave birth to Iuz: Zugg~moy, a female archfiend known as the "Queen of Fungi," who has tried to subvert and conquer the Flanaess; Tharizdun, a "dead god whose revival, some say, would mean the destruction of the world; Acererak, the demilich whose "Tomb of Horrors" has destroyed hundreds of adventurers; Keraptis, an evil wizard whose volcanic home in White Plume Mountain houses powerful artifacts - and the world's largest crab; the Falcon, a serpentine monster who tried to take over the City of Greyhawk from below but is believed slain; and the Slave Lords, the organized crime masters who once dominated the Pomarj and Wild Coast, and may rise again. 4 21 FAMOUS ORDERS OF KNIGHTHWD AND h E R WELL-KNOWN o ~ A N l u \ n O N S For information on roleplaying a member of the knightly orders, please see the player kits on pages 55-58 of this book. Knights of Luna This sectet order was founded in Celene by &en warriors and spellcasters who opposed Queen Yolande's neutrality in the Greyhawk Wars. Members work to involve Celene in supporting the elves of Veluna and the Duchy of Ulek in their struggles against evil. The order indudes in its ranks Me16 Prince Brightflame, a powerful elven warrior-wizard, cousin to Yolande. Knights of Holy Shielding Before they were conquered by the armies of Iuz, the core of the Shield Lands armies was a religious order of knights called the Knights of the Shield, or more formally Knights of Holy Shielding. With the conquest of the Shield Lands and the capture of the head of the order, Lord Holmet, the surviving knights have been led in exile by Lady Katarina, Holmer's cousin and a paladin of the god Heironeous.The proud knights managed to regain Critwall and Scragholme Island during the Great Northern Crusade after the Greyhawk wars. Knights of the Watch Before the Greyhawk Wars, great soldiers from Keoland, Gran March, Bissel and Geoff united and pledged to defend their nations from Baklunish invasion. Castles and keeps were maintained along the Ket border, but many of these were circumvented or overrun when Ket invaded B i d .  When Geoff fell to an invasion of giants, Keoland and Gran March became the sole centers of Watch activity. The Knighu have since returned to B i d ,  and some are in Sterich. Order of the Hart Before the Greyhawk Wars there were three branches of this order: the Knights of up exclusively of Highfolk elves.These warriors have been much reduced by the wars, in theVesve Forest. All the knights hate Iuz with a passion and dislike Perredand. Furyondy, the Knights of Veluna, and the Knights of the High Forest, which was made especially the Knights of Furyondy The High Forest knights are fighting Iuz's forces 3. " ' y qp" Rangers of the Gnarley Forest This group holds three goals above all others: to protect the integriry of the forest, to help good folk in need, and to worship a power of good (especially Ehlonna). The organization is not concerned about politics or squabbles over land. They render aid to the lost, injured and persecuted within their woods, but their first concern is always the forest's welfare. For information on playing a Gnarley Ranger, please see the character kit on page 54 of thin book. The Fellowship of the Torch This small but famous group has dedicated itself to eliminating Iuz, his agents and his threats. The Greyhawk Wars daimed several of the Torch's members: now the grim survivors follow any lead, no matter how dangerous, and engage in any bade against Iuz, no matter how deadly.They eagerly join expeditions to retrieve evil magical items and slay Iuz's followers, and will do anything in their power to see the demigod destroyed. The members of the fellowship have many friends, and it is possible to gain news of their whereabouu through the Gnarley Forest Rangers, the Temple of Rao or the Knights of Luna ' a fairly low violent &e rate. Although it was relatively untouched by the Greyhawk Wars, the city nonetheless has felt its share of burdens following the marches of so many armies. Refugees are the primary concern and diffidty for the city New construction is everywhere, and more rehgecs have set up camp outside the city walls. Tradc was disrupted somewhat, with temporary shortages of goods from time to time in the city's markets. Crime threatened to spin out of conml, hut thanks to additional watchmen hired by the Chief Constable and some help from the Guild of W d t y  the University of Magical Arts and the various temples, Greyhawk's violent crime rate r a i n s  stable. The Free City l h  most Lvge cities, is an excellent place to "disappear" for as long as several m o n k .  T h e  city has numerous swelled population reduces any chance of being noticed. An individual who keeps a low profile (and perhaps uses disguises judiciously) might be able to hide here for as long as several years. For those adventuren who have never visited the famed City of Greyhawk and for those who have been away for a while, following is a quick tour of the city as it stands in 591 CY. A map of the city can be kund on pager 32-33 of this book More information on the city will appear in future a ' resources for aid, food and shelter, and the GREYHAWK products. The City of Greyhawk is a roughly oval-shaped, walled city on the banks of the Selintan River. To the north lie the Cairn Hills and the Midbay of the Nyr Dyv. To the south is the Plain of Greyhawk: on the west bank of the Selintan to the south of the city is the Gnarley Forest: due east is the Mistmarsh. The Selinm eventually emptier into Woolly Bay. The city itself is mostly surrounded by farmland with some lightly wooded areas to the north.The dimate is moderate, with long, warm summen, a rainy spring and fall, and a chilly but rarely subzero winter that usually results in a few inches of snowfall. A few features lie outside the city walls. The river docks, outside the center of the western wall, allow cargo and passengers to arrive and disembark. ShackTom, a slum outside the walls on the northern edge of the city, has stood for as long as anyone can remember, but it has more than doubled in size in the past few years thanks to incoming refugees. These (supposedly) temporary quarters housing the poor and indigent have spilled over onto the opposite bank of the Selintan, with the Rhennee bargefolk appreciating the opportunity for new business. A community of Rhennee barges still dock just outside the city's northern wall. Just outside the southeastern wall stands the manor of Lord Wainright. Several generations of the family have farmed these lands and built wagons here for sale and trade. The family has had several pm~perou~ years, but its personal worth has not increased, since they have assisted refugees and the City of Gteyhawk with picking up the pieces after the war. StoneRing. Indisputably built by druids centuries ago, no one knows the purpose of these standing stones. Other circles are scattered across the continent, but this is believed to be the oldest of the lot. Druids often stop to offer a prayer when passing the circle. Seven gates offer access to the city. Most are closed during nighttime hours, hut all require visitors to sign the city registers upon entering. South of the Wainright manor and closer to the city wall stands the ancient Greyhawk is split into three primary sections by two gated walls running west to east. The northern section is home to the High Quarter and the Garden Quarter, where most of the wealthy make their homes. Also in this area are the Temples of St. Cuthbert, Pelor and Zilchus, a gambling house, the opera house, the mayor's mansion, the Wizards' Guildhall, the High Market (or Grand Bazaar) and the Grand Citadel, Player's Guide to Greyhawl home of Greyhawk's law enforcement. to the River Quarter, a somewhat seedy sedon of town with inns, taverns and warehouses; Clerkburg, home to the City Mint, Grey College and other institutions of learning; the Artisans' Quarter, a peaceful neighborhood of craftspeople and their families and a number of guildhalls; and the Foreign Quarter. In the past, this latter quarter was designed far noncitizens who wished to live in the city, After seven consecutive years of residence, these folk could apply for citizenship in the city and then purchase property in Geyhawk. Because of the flood of refugees in recent years, these rules have been relaxed. The Directing Oligarchy - a panel of twelve to sixteen members currently led by Lord Mayor Nerof Gasgal - plans to enforce the zoning codes again as soon as possible. The southern portion of Greyhawk, known as Old City (the northern two- thirds being New City), includes some of the poorer and rowdier neighborhoods. Divided roughly into the Slum Quarter and the Thieves' Quarter, this section is home to many of the more cololful citizens of the city, but most folk would rather not raise a famdy here. A large section of the central Old City known as the Great Burn (destroyed by fire many years ago) has been COmpldy cleared and rebuilt in the past five years. Much of the available ground in Old City has been built on, though there is no construction on a narrow strip of land along the inside of the city walls (per city ordinance, no building may touch the wall, to prevent unfriendly factions from drilling into the stonework and breaching the d). Anyone looking for adventure (or trouble) is sure to find it here. the ProcessionaL Beginning at the southernmost gate, the Highway Gate, the Processional passer through Old City, Black Gate, the River and Artisans' Quarters, the Low Market (or Petit Bazaar), the Foreign Quarter and Clerkburg, the Garden Gate, and finally the High and Gatden Quarters to terminate at the Grand Citadel. Inarguably the best way to see the city, the Processional is always bury with traffic but well maintained, even in bad weather. The central section of the city is home The city's main thoroughfare is known as 1 -- THE CITY OF GREYHAWK -cJ- CITV SITES The Grand Citadel (High Quarter): Within the walls of this large stronghold on the city's northeast side are the administrative headquarters for the City Watch and Greyhawk Militia, the great prison of Greyhawk, a weapons arsenal, and the City Vault, in which incredible wealth is rumored to be stored under heay guard. Access to the Citadel is greatly restricted; the main gates are opened only at fixed times of the day except in grave emergencies, and authorization is required to enter. The Citadel has not had to serve defensively for centuries, but no one doubts it would be highly effective against even aerial or magical assault. The Guild of Wirardry (High Quarter): In a city filled with powerful mages, the guild that supports and regulates them has immense power. Adventurers wishing to speak with members of the Circle of Eight or other wizards are well-advised to check at the Guild for amilable information about their whereabouts. It can also be tactful for magic-using characters to check in here on first arriving in the city. The Lord Mayor's P&ce (High Quarter): While not palatial, the is one of the finest residences in the City - as well as serving as a headquarters for civic doings.

The Guildhalls: If a visitor were to ask a merchant about something that stands out about the City of Geyhawk, he would undoubtedly answer, "the guilds." Geyhawk rivals every city in the Flanaess for the number and effectiveness of its guilds. Whether adventurers are newcomers looking for work or leads, skilled craftsmen themselves, or employers looking for a job to be performed, the respective guild should provide more than sufficient information. A cautionary note: None of the guilds' services are free, and , " players should he prepared to make donations of money, goods or raw materials to the guild treasuries.

In particular, the postwar collapse of the "Downwind Guild" of leathenuorkers, tanners, smiths, stahlers, weavers and tailors is responsible for many new groups. ft: This group underwent internal reorganization after the Greyhawk Wars, adding new members and occupations to its roster. The Whistling Fish (River Quarter): This inn in Greyhawk's River Quarter is operated by a half-hill giant named Gruenab. The building is constructed on a scale to suit its owner, 50 the ceilings, staircases and bar are exceptionally high. The place is nonetheless cozy, and Gruenab has built up a well-mannered dientele over the years. The Whistling Fish consists of a large pub/dining mom, kitchen, storerooms, several guest moms upstairs and a stable. Gruenab has his o m  cottage attached to the rear of the tavern. The Undercity: Unlikely as it seems, one of the features that earned the Gem of the Flanaess its title is the city's sewer system.

NOTABLES IN GREVHAWK Nerof Gasgal As Lord-Mayor of the City of Greyhawk, Gasgal holds an enviable position.

(A sixth group, the Olman of the Arnedio Jungle, exist as former slaves in the Hold of the Sea Princes.) Many fok retain distinctive racial characteristics, but most are difficult to recognize due to long centuties of mixed marriages. However even in these cases, many families identify with a certain racial group and follow those traditions and customs whether they resemble their ancestors or not. Only the Rhennee shun clothing including loincloths, capes and leather wrappings on their feet that served as shoes. They also wore brightly colored body paints, primarily vermilion and yellow ochre, in primitive patterns, a practice still common among the surviving Rovers of the Barrens. In civilized regions such as the Duchy of Tenh, Flan clothing tends to follow current fashion, though in solid, bright primary colors. The ancient Flannae were a peaceful people who followed a regular pattern of seasonal migration. They lived off the land, hunting and gathering, and their population remained relatively steady They had a strong view of nature as an entity, and the myths, legends and culture dl emphasized the importance and values of a close relationship with nature. All of the known druidic gods are Flan in origin. While many Flannae were able to coexist with the immigrating Suel and Oeridians, others found themselves pushed from their traditional lands. They were forced to hunt in unfamiliar territories and dimates, and some scholars speculate that the Flannae nearly died out during these difficult years. Some of the pureblooded Flannae still show characteristics of their ancestors. They tend to prefer open spaces to crowded cities, and they have an affinity for gardening (especially among those with no choice but to live in crowded conditions). Some Flan (particularly those of the Rovers, though many of them have hem killed in recent years) are good with horses.The Flannae have a strong tradition for storytelling, and most families have a repertoire of legends and traditions passed down through the generations. They like to spend as much time as they can out of doors, and a favorite pastime during comfortable weather is to build an outdoor fire and gather the family around for an evening of stories. The tree helps to maintain the family's ties to nature and remind them to care for the Oerth mother Beory. Among some branches of the Flan, if the tree sickens or dies, this is taken as a sign that the family must move or perhaps had luck or some wil influence. Trees and plants are often given as gifts to welcome a new baby or to greet a Flan family moving to a new home. For good luck, some Flannae keep a dried or pressed leaf from their home tree when traveling or adventuring. !* martiages outside their own race.

They are sometimes difficult to differentiate from other races, with skin ranging from tan to olive, hair varying in color from honey-blonde to black (with brown and auburn being most common), and eyes of every common calor, though most often brown or gray. Oeridians are recognized more easily through their choice of clothing. mixed with other races, still identify with eventually took control of what is now Furyondy Perrenland, the Shield Lands, the t 1 The original Flan nomads of a Player's Guide to Greyhawk 34 RACES OF EASTERN OERIK Favoring plaids and checks, sometimes with unusual variations such as diamond or lozenge patterns, the Oeridians are perhaps the flashiest dressers in the Flanaers. Their clothing normally consists of close-fitting trousers and short tunics with capes or cloaks. Historically, the Oeridians were fierce warriors and aggressive about controlling land. They fought hard to maintain their borders and even harder to acquire lands they desired. Conquerors by nature, they are accustomed to thinking of themselves as the best humanity has to offer and thus destined to rule. They are prone to take charge, obey their superiors, and sacrifice for the good of whatever group they are in. All Oeridians suffer from bouts of temper, however, and those who can control their emotions and channel their energies into productive activity are regarded highly among all the races. Oeridians have a talent for focusing their attention in combat, and this sometimes gives them the upper hand. They consider fighting a craft, and practice is taken very seriously. Some Oeridians practice acrobatics, tumbling, unarmed fighting and even dance as part of their training. Because of the great amounts of time the warriors devote to practicing their art, Oeridians tend to be nimble. The Oeridians are recognized for the superb weapons and armor they produce. They are always looking for ways to improve their odds in a battle, and that includes perfecting existing weapons and armor designs, and inventing new types of armor and weapons. They are also very inventive with developing magical armor and weapons and combat spells. Oeridian custom requires that a gift be offered to a host or hostess when an overnight stay is anticipated. Traditionally, this gesture was meant to put the hosting family at ease and serve as a sign that the visitors had no designs on acquiring the host's land or property. The Oeridian people feel deep ties to clan and are fiercely protective of both their immediate and extended family, A threat to an Oeridian's land or property is only slightly less important than a threat to his family THE RHENNEE The Rhennee are truly the enigma among the races of Greyhawk. While the other foul races can trace their histories to elsewhere on the continent, the Rhennee have separate origins. They are thought to have first appeared in the Flanaess in the area around the Adri Forest around 150 CY, moving west to avoid harassment by Aerdy soldiers and citizens. The Rhennee increasingly left the land to become migrants on the central rivers, until comparatively few land-dwelling Rhennee now exist. Though they rarely speak of this to outsiders, their legends claim that the race came to Oerth accidentally from their home world of Rhop. Although the Rhenn-folk have only a few ideas of what their home plane was like or how they got here, they know that it was quite different from the Flanaers. in the tan to olive shades and h r  tends to be black or dark brown, and curly hair is most common. Their eyes m most often brown, gray or hazel, but blue or green eyes are not unusual.The Rhennee are w q  and short, with males averaging about 5' 6", but they are exceptionally stmng for their build The Rhennee live exclusively on the waterways. making their homes on large barges that average about 60 feet long and 15 feet wide.These sturdy barges are similar in style to a j d ; they are capable of navigating the Nyx Dyvi often choppy waters and treacherous storms, as well as rivemys.These ships may have one or fwo m t s . A single barge may be home to as m q as 45 people, including a captain or chiet; cwo to four guards, a "wise woman," an advisor or two, 13 to 24 adults, and swen to twelve children (up to age 12). The guards may be male or female, but the advisors m always female. The wise woman is the matriarch of the group (although not all families on the barge are related); At a glance, some Rhennee might be confused with Oeridians. Rhennee skin color ranger her role is to tell forrunes for land-dwellers and thus earn coin, and also to predict the weather, settle disputes and use her SMS with herbalism for minor healing. Thc wise woman is the driving force in Rhennee society: not even a noble will knowingly conttadm her. In spite of the role of the wise woman and her advisors, Rhennee society is extremely chauvinistic. Other women are treated as helpmeets and gain some respt~t from the men, but they are basically considered chattel. No formal rite of marriage exists, and barge captains and nobles may have as many "wives" as they can support. The men tend toward proud, aggressive behavior and are quick to issue a challenge to a non-Rhennee male who looks in the direction of one of their women. The Rhennee earn their living primarily through transportation of goods and passengers, with some hunting, fishing, trading and craftwork on the side. Most will not work when they can steal and thus have the thieving proficiency although they avoid stealing from each other. Some also have a skill for tinkering, but their reputations vary widely. Most of these folk do not seem indined toward good or evil, but instead lean toward neutrality. Some Rhennee have recently followed evil cults (for example, those of Vecna , and Iuz), but this influence has been thrown off. The Rhennee follow a rather strict set of norms that has different standards for their own kind and for non-Rhennee. Many of their customs are baffling to outsiders, and the Rhennee seem to like it that way floats an the Selintan RivecThe city officials ignore the flotilla, leaving the Rhmnee to resolve their own problems in their own way. This system works well for d concerned. Outside the City of Greyhawk, a large settlement (if it can be called that) of Rhennee THE SULOIU The Sue1 folk arrived in Oerik as refugees from lands south and west of the Crystalmist and Hellfurnace Mountains. Escaping the wars in their homelands, the Suloise helped to displace the Fknnae from their traditional lands and were themselves scattered far and wide. No one is certain what the ancient Suloise Empire war like. Most of their former realm was destroyed by the Rain of Colorless Fire, leaving behind what is now called the Sea of Dust. Rumors abound of Suloise ruins and treasures buried in the Sea of Dust, but the climate there is so harsh that few dare to po looking for this wealth. ' ranges in the strawberry blondes, yellows and platinums. Wavy or kinky hair is seen as often as straight hair. The Frost. Ice and Snow Barbarians are the best examples of pure Sue1 blood. Suel descendants are also predominant in the Duchy of Umst, the islands off the eastern coast of the Flanaess, and the lands of the Scarlet Brotherhood on theTilvanot Peninsula. Some Suloise settled in the Amedio Jungle and H-lepmonaland. where they became tanned and freckled. Ancient Suloise wore wide-legged pantaloons and laore blouses. These styles are still popular but have been adapted for dimate. In the north, these garments can be of fur or felted wool, worn with capes, furred boots and mittens. Those in the south sometimes wear a loose vest instead of a blouse, and fabrics are lightweight. Solid colors are preferred universally, with most folk having only one or two colors in their wardrobe. The Suloise also like to wear emblems and souvenir trinkets on their clothing. These ornaments are considered important items of family heritage. They can be passed down through generations. They fight more among themselves than other human groups because of these ancient allegiances. The Suloise have a strong sense of the importance of ancestral and family ties. The Suloise are not known for their patience and have a short way with disagreements, Player's Guide to Greyhawk since they tend to be opinionated and convinced that their notions are the best. A popular saying in some parts of the Flanaess is, "when d the Suloise have lcft the table," meaning that nothing constructive will take place in a discussion until anyone unwilling to be open-minded is removed. There folk are also known for their manual dexterity. They have a talent far dl arts and crafts, especially those involving detail work such as embroidery, sewing, leather tooling, sculpting and painting. Suloise weavers can demand the highest prices on the continent for their fabrics, both for the fine grain of their weaves and the extraordinary detail of thcir patterns. The Suel have a long tradition of wizardty and magical research, and the ancient Sue1 Imperium produced many powerful magics, culminating in the Invoked Devastation that laid waste to the ancient Baklunish Empire. Even now many Sue1 become mages. Perhaps their dexterity gives them an advantage in manipulating spell components and gesticulations THE BAKLUNISH The Baklunish are settled mainly in the northwestern regions of the Flanaess. Zeif, Ull, Ekbir and theTiger Nomads are the best examples of pure Baklunish folk. Their skin tends ro be golden and eyes are most commonly green or gray-green, with gray and hazel less frequent. Hair color is always dark, ranging from blue- black to dark brown. Baklunish features can be seen mixed with those of other races in the nations of Ket and Tusmit, and among the Wolf Nomads and the Paynim tribes. In the north, bright colors and gaudy patterns are tpical of Baklunish costume, with gowns and robes favored, and short breekr with long coats nearly as popular. Peasant folk in the north also wear gaudy fabrics, but tend more toward a single long robe with whatever adornments are available. The southern Baklunish favor colors in the pastel ranges, with patterns also popular.

OTHER INTELLIGENT RACES Giants Giants of the Flanaess come in many sizes and races, some with unusual quirks.

Because the GREYHAWK setting was the first world designed for the AD&D game, the demihumans described in the AD&D rules may be considered to have been designed with the demihumans of the world of Greyhawk in mind. Demihuman characters generated for play in the Flanaess should be rolled as described in the Player’s Handbook. An exception to this is the dwarves of the central Flanaess, who have been given their own kit in this book, which describes three groups of dwurfok found in the Domain of Greyhawk. Information about half-orcs in Greyhawk has also been included in this book, as part of the Greyhawk thug kit. : OPTIONAL RACIAL ABILITY ADJUSTMENTS A campaign’s DM may choose to make optional adjustments to the abilities of individuals based on racial background.

They are also required to offer a gift to their mounts, pets and familiars once a year (usually on the character's birthday if known). Breath children are forbidden to eat meat during the spring. Flesh symbolizes humanity and demihumanity, identified with the time of year when bodies starved over the winter regain their fat. While many Flan choose to ornament their bodies with tattoos and other permanent marks, only Flesh children muit have at least one tattoo or body piercing. They are also required to offer aid to anyone who asks for it (though the aid doesn't have to be what is requested: for instance, someone asking a Flan to escort her to Ket may instead be given a silver piece - which is, after all, helpful). They permanently wear leather bands knotted elaborately around one wrist for every person they consider kin or a friend.

Roleplaying Oeridian Characters :at nations of the Flanaess (Furyondy, Nyrond and the Great Kingdom itsell) were 1 by Oeridians migrating from the west, and Oeridian culture has gone a long way shaping “generic” Flanaess culture. They are generally straightforward pragmatists with est in empire building and a passion for fighting and exploration. historic Oerid respect for organizational hierarchies makes an Oeridian more likely meone from another race to settle easily into strictly regulated military groups such as tly orders, or into a position of responsibility reporting to political leaders - for :, as a sheriff to a county or shire. le he will usually follow orders without many questions, a typical Oeridian is somewhat mpered and given to direct action when solving what he sees as a problem.

They may rebel in covert ways authority, or they may follow even absurd or destructive orders without question. ns from the former Great Kingdom are more likely to be rogues, or have taken on rogue proficiencies, such as disguise or reading lips. y Oeridians become warriors. Raised since duldhood to respect men and women of lost have studied at least one melee weapon before they are adults. They may fill pons specialization slots with skds that improve their agility, such as dancing, juggling, ig and tightrope walking. However, mages who specialize in combat and protection re also common; Oeridian mages create many combat-related magical items. dians also value the making of weapons and armor.

The weapons or armor an Oeridian adventurer begins er with has a chance of being more effective or more valuable, simply because of its c workmanship.

Primary weapon is worth double the standard value for such a weapon. Secondary weapon has a nonmagical +I bonus to attack roll (weapon type determined before dice roll). Secondary weapon is worth double the standard value for such a weapon. Armor is nonmagical +1 for its type (armor type determined before dice roll). Armor is worth double the standard value for such armor. er‘s Guide to Greyhawk Roleplaying Rhennee Characters The Rhennee deeply dislike non-Rhennee and are treated with suspicion by others, so a player needs the approval of her DM to play a Rhennee character. A satisfactory backstory will be needed to explain why one of the Rhennee chose to behend the other PCs and abandon the barge life - and why the others tolerate and accept the Rhennee. Of course, a party where all members are Rhennee avoids this problem. If the player wishes, she may roll for her reason for leaving her W y

An adventurer may well send wealth back to his family, or may summon a sibling and train her in the arts of adventuring. A Suel can be aware of his ancestry back even to the days of the Suel Empire a thousand years ago. The Suel are shorter tempered than people in the Flanaess generally. To resolve an issue, they are as likely to use direct means including force (whether political, magical or physical) as they are to use indirect means such as negotiation or manipulation. They are often proud and may not allow others to know if they have financial or personal problems. organizations tend to slide that way. several subcultural options: Family obligations are strong among the Suloise, who will fiercely protect what they The ancient Suel Empire was deeply evil in nature and even now some Suel Players choosing to roleplay a Suloise can roll on the following table, or choose from Suloise Subgroup Table Idlo SuloLe Subgroup 1-2 Thillonrian Peninsula barbarians 3 Island Realms Suel 4-8 Central Flanaess Suel 9 10 Scarlet Brotherhood informants Amedio Jungle or Hepmonaland barbarians Thillonrian Peninsula barbarians: Many savants consider the Snow, Ice and Frost Barbarians of the far northeast to be the purest-blooded of oristing Suel.

Their celebrations indude a wide range of festive songs and dances. For major holidays, parades are conducted using life-size (and larger) puppets. Badunish funerals have their own repertoire of slow, solemn, harmonic songs that are sung by all in attendance. Many Baklunish greet the morning or end their day with a song. Roleplaying Mixed Human Characters While many people are able to identify themselves with a single race, others are of mixed blood or have a sttong affinity to more than one race: a character with an Oeridian mother and Baklunish father, for instance, or a nedy pure Sue1 family living in a primarily Flan village in Perrenland. Players can reflect this in their characters by demonstrating characteristics of both (or all) the races in their background. In addition, some characters may not care about their race or origin, or may come fmm families, communities or groups who have little or no racial affiliation. For example, a character growing up and living in the City of Greyhawk can dmonsttate as many or few racial characteristics as his player desires. NAMES AND FORMS OF ADDRESS Systems of naming are wide and varied in the Flanaess, with many local customs. Following are a few general guidelines. Common humanity: Most ordmary fok have a smgle name. If an mdwidual has a trade of any kmd, this might be added to h s  name, as m D o m  Gemcutter or Thadeus the Armorer. If an mdmdual is easdy idenufiable by some physical or behamoral charactensac, it is possible that he wd be tagged with dus, as m Janko Whe-Eye or Gitta the Quick. If a f d y member w i t h  a couple of generations has some reasonable local fame, that mght be substituted for the career tag, as m Marran, cousin of Hewell Orc-Cleaver. When travellng and identifjnng oneself to strangers, one’s home becomes part of his name: Kendren of Hookhd or Stonehold Jakk. Exiles: Many people have been uprooted by the Greyhawk Wars and ConMumg unrest throughout the Flanaess. They often use ther o n p a l  homeland as part of their name. This takes precedence even over earned heroic titles, so that Jenna Gorgonstab becomes Jenna of Geoff now that she is exded to Furyondy. Identifjmg oneself by homeland is considered a matter of pnde. Nobles: In almost all lands, nobles m a formal situauon are addressed by utle and first name, then by f d y  or locatlon. Lord Nellist Egremont ( f d y )  of Woodwych (home) would be content to be referred to as “Lord Nellist” m everyday discourse; m court he would expect his fLll names and utle to be used. Many exded nobles do not use ther homeland as part of ther name, because &s emphaslzes the sorrow and embarrassment of theu loss. A tactful host would refer to h s  guest as Lord Nellist or Lord Nebst Egremont, if that unfortunate mdmdual lost his lands. A number of unscrupulous individuals have used this J crcumstance to set up as false nobhty, either to trade on the goodwdl of people who dunk they are exiles, or for other, more damapg cons. , Grimmri Fischer the Jester, Grimmri Fischer of the Highfok or Grimmri Fischer, Locksmith of Greyhawk Halflings Like gnomes, halllings use a first and a family name, but they also use and identifj. themselves by nicknames, pet names or other devices that most races find irksome. Thus the halfling Harriet Thorngage might also be known as Goldie for her hair color, The Gager fiom her last name, Greensleeves for a favorite gown, and Nettles or Netta from an old family nickname - all within hour. Humanoids: Humanoids typically use a simple first name, with a clan or family allegiance if appropriate. Captains and clan leaders are referred to by honorifics that may have to do with favorite weapons, execution or torture tactics, disgusting personal habits, or physical prowess. Sometimes, these honorifics refer in some fashion to the clan name, so that a chieftain of the Broken Skull clan might be known as Arakkosh Headcleaver. Wizards: Regardless of background,most wizards are identified by a single name: Mordenkainen or Bigby are examples. Generally, the higher a mage’s eminence, the more likely this is, though there are extremely powerfLl mages with multiple names, like Jallarzi Sallavarian and Warnes Starcoat Clerics: Priests are known by their name and the location of their temple, such as Hamras of Leukish, though occasionally a noble priest will be referred to by his personal and family names. Elves Elves always use family names, unsurprising given that siblings and half-siblings may be a century or more apart in age. Family names in translation are usually romantic and flowery: Starglow, Silverfrond and the like. Even in their original tongue, they tend to be melodious; Theodain Eriason of the Circle of Eight and Fioranna Aielestriel, Nyrondese ambassador to the City of Greyhawk, are typical examples. Half-elves and elves living near human communities may add a career or loiation tag io their names for ease in de&g with humans. Dwarves: Deeply proud of their lineage, dwarves always use family names, and a highly formal etiquette applies to their usage. A dwarf will introduce himself to a stranger by mentioning his first name, his clan and a list of his ancestors. Four is standard, though a modest dwarf may only go back three; a dwarf citing five generations is either boas& or showing a high degree of trust in whoever he is taking to. Only a leader cites his ancestry back six generations. After the first introduction a dwarf is likely to permit first-name terms unless he is a leader, in which case his fdl name (but not his ancestry) will continue to be used. Dwarves exiled or driven from their homelands do not commonly proclaim this by using their homeland as part of their name. Humans generally call dwarves by their first name and clan name, though on occasion they may substitute a nickname for the clan name, as in King Holgi Hirsute of the Iron Hds. This might be the family home, or a workplace, or anything that might seem important to them at the moment At different times in his life, Gnmmri Fischer might be known as Gnomes: Gnomes use a first and a family name, and always add an additional tag as well. FORMS OF PROPER ADDRESS Anyone mixing with exalted individuals needs to know the correct forms of address when dealing with royalty, nobles and knights. In the states of the western central Flanaess, the following forms of address are conventional, in order of precedence. honorifics and forms of address. Thus the Baroness Alida Vaessen of Hartbrooke might be called “Your Prominence,” since that is the correct form of address for a baroness; but the truly knowledgeable would call her “My Lady Hartbrooke,” since that is the correct form of address for the Baronesses of Hartbrooke. The terms given below are hardy comprehensive, and the forms of address are appropriate only until one learns the more correct specific forms. Not all titles exist in all lands, but their order of precedence is consistent, though there is some confusion between the various degrees of Dukes and Princes: for instance Karll, Duke Palatine and head of the Duchy of Urnst, ranks higher than many princes. It is far more tactful to refer to a noble with too exalted a form than with too low a one. Most tides have distinct additional 48 Player’s Guide to Greyhawk ROLEPLAWNG IN THE FLANAESS Titles and Forms of Address Title Emperor/Empress, Overking/Overqueen King/Queen Prince/Princess Duke/Duchess Archcleric, High Priest Margrave, Marquis/Marchioness, Marquise Earl, Count, Graf, Plar/Countess Viscount/Viscountess Baron/Baroness Lord Mayor Knight Commander Knight Banneret Mayor Knight/Lady Companion Knight/Lady Bachelor Cleric, Priest Knight/Lady Elder Gentleman/Gentlewoman Esquire Yeoman POPULAR E x p ~ ~ s s i w s A few local greetings and other expressions of note are listed here, for the use of travelers and the satisfaction of the curious. Cold iron avail you is a common exchange between warriors among the Highfolk and in Furyondy, referring to the power of cold iron against certain undead, particularly the servants of Iuz. Among the same folk, I spit on the Old One is an aggressive greeting or expression of bravery or disdain. Stone endures (and its many variations, such as As long as stone endures and Stone endures s a l )  is a greeting and sign of friendship among those allied with Irongate, as an acknowledgment of the bravery of the dwarves there and the strength of their walled city. Ware and were, friend is a greeting used by and to rangers of the Gnarley Forest, who have many friends among the werebears there. When used by an outsider, it indicates the courtesy to learn something of the rangers’ ways. Hands in your pockets, eyes on your purse! is a common farewell in the City of Greyhawk, where thieves are everywhere. Until the starbreak is a farewell and 49 Formal form of address Your Imperial Majesty Your Majesty Your Highness or Your Noble Grace Your Grace Your Royal Highness Your Nobleness, Your Nobility Your Eminence Your Noble Lordship/Ladyship Your Prominence Your Lordship/Ladyship Most Honorable Sir/Lady Right Honorable Sir/Lady Honorable Worship Most Worthy Sir/Lady Worthy Sir/Lady varies according to church, but Father/Mother are often appropriate Sir/My Lady Honorable Master/Mistress Master/Mistress Squire Socman/Socwoman oath of fidelity used among northern barbarians. It has two meanings. In bitterly cold weather, the exhalation of breath causes a tiny cloud of frost to form and fall, and these falling flakes are referred to as “the breaking of stars.” hence, “until the starbreak” can mean “until we speak again.” It can also mean “until the end of the world,” since certain barbaric myths indicate that the world ends with a shower of stars that fall when the heavens break. Shielding. It refers to their deity Heironeous, who possesses an axe that can grow or shrink will be reclaimed, and that better times will come. Are you athought?

The implication is that proper followers should not think but follow orders. situation changes without apparent effect. Referring to the fact that the collapse of the Great Kingdom was followed by the founding of two new contenders for its dominant position, it means that things never really change - except to get worse. Sure as a Shielding oath refers to the Knights of Holy Shielding, famed for their loyalty. It indicates a thing is a near-certainty. Sweet as the Mistmarsh is a phrase used ironically throughout the Domain to indicate a business deal or an agreement that smells fishy to the speaker. Kill your fither, eat your mother is an exhortation used to encourage the orcs of the Pomarj to acts of evil and vice. However, it becomes a horrible insult if an orc’s parents are both dead, since it implies that he is incapable of true evil. Such a use generally leads to a fight to the death.

The Palace of the Rhennee The Rhennee folk who call the Flanaess home are as scattered and disconnected as dust motes in a cyclone. The Rhennee themselves, along with a few Oeridian scholars, know that the Rhennee are not native to Oerth and that they arrived here from some great distance. How this occurred, when, or why is a total mystery. But some believe that when the Rhennee first appeared on Oerth, they settled on a remote shore on the Nyr Dyv, building a palace complex to be shared by all the Rhennee pioneers and to be ruled by their chosen leader. Whether the palace was ever completed or became besieged later is also a mystery. How the Rhennee became scattered handfuls of refugees, no one can say. But the palace is still rumored to exist, and if it were found, it might hold exotic other- worldly treasures of fantastic magical or monetary value. Portals to the Rhennee home world might also be found. Scant evidence exists to suggest that such a palace might truly be found in the Flanaess. The most common knowledge of the palace lies in an old Rhennee saying, “When I find the Rhennee palace.. . .” This phrase is practically equivalent to the more common human saying, “When my ship comes in,” indicating that the speaker believes his luck will change when a mythical ship arrives to shower wealth upon him. The Petrified Wizard In a mangaroo swamp of the Mistmarsh stands a half-sunken stone statue of a wizard. Legends are in agreement that the wizard succumbed to a cockatrice. The story intrigues many. Citizens of Greyhawk and neighboring small villages report that they sell supplies to marsh explorers at least several times per year. Of those who return to brag about their adventures, none have actually seen the petrified wizard. An apprentice mage from the City of Greyhawk is reported to make weekly observations of the Mistmarsh 51 while practicing her flying spells; she claims to have once seen a virtual garden of stone sculptures, but before she could get close enough to investigate, she was driven out of the marsh by a sudden dense fog. The Mistmarsh is a dangerous site in its own right, filled with natural hazards, lizardmen, human bandits, intelligent monsters and giant examples of many creatures such as frogs, spiders, rats and crocodiles. The Bright Lands “The Empire of the Bright Lands” is Rary of Ket’s name for his new-found realm, hidden in the Brass Hills of the Bright Desert. After his betrayal of the Circle of Eight, his castle was magically moved from its location in Ket to its new position here. Now it serves as a local power base for evil. Officials of the City of Greyhawk are concerned that this new “empire” might choose to attack the Domain at some point. To learn more about Rary, please see page 23 of this book. Still more information about Rary and the Bright Lands is available in WGR3, the Rary the Tvaitor accessory (#9386,1992). The Screaming Valley This four-mile-long gouge in the earth has no geologic explanation; scholars can find no evidence that wind, water or earthquake formed this desolate valley in the Cairn Hills. Nor can they explain the fact that the valley is utterly lifeless; not so much as a moss, lichen or scrub tree grows along its length. The Screaming Valley is no hotter, colder or drier than the surrounding terrain, offering no explanation for the valley’s barren condition. Seeds and seedlings planted in the valley wither and die within a day of being placed in the mysterious rift. he very center of the valley rises a pitted and honeycombed monolith of me. How this soft stone was formed here is another geologic mystery. When the lows strongly, especially in spring and fall, it whistles through the tunnels and )f the sandstone, creating an eerie sound that can be heard for several miles.

An aged wyvern nests in the valley and netimes be seen circling overhead, hunting for food. Galeb duhr inhabit the great most noteworthy incident involving the Screaming Valley came eighteen years ago, he body of an illithid, ritually scarred and stabbed, washed down from the valley. : the body was well preserved, no determination could be made as to its age. 7 villagers, superstitious and fearful of the illithid, tried to incinerate the body on a pyre but the corpse refused to burn. They eventually dug a hole until they struck water, dumped in the weighted body, and filled in the ever-sinking hole over the of several months. Warning signs and holy wards still mark the site.

Recently, Lemnen’s agents discovered something buried near Skorane, but whether it is an ancient temple to Incabulos remains to be seen. Excavations by crews of undead are underway. Rangers of the Gnarley Forest are monitoring the site and are hiring adventurers as spies and troops should an assault become necessary. Lemnen believes that a forgotten temple The Wandering Caravan Several times a year, a phantom caravan of merchants and guards appears on the roads circling the Nyr Dyv. The caravan - three wagons with blue-and-black-striped awnings (each pulled by four horses), six peripheral riders and horses, six teamsters and six guards - has appeared to assist stranded travelers, fight off bandit attacks on other caravans, and spoil ambushes that might cause loss of life or property. No one is certain who the members of the caravan are or when their appearances began. Some witnesses profess the entourage to be entirely ghostly, while others insist that the caravan’s members are in a weird form of stasis, victims of a curse that forces them to ride the roads around the Nyr Dyv until they fulfill some goal or correct an old misdeed. Their intentions seem to be honorable, and they can be recognized by the complete lack of sound made by the horses and wagons. 52 Just as in other settings, characters in a GREYHAWK campaign setting may be customized using kits. This section outlines several new kits unique to the Flanaess, as well as offering more general information about playing dwarves in the Domain of Greyhawk. Players are free to propose other kits from previously published game material, and as always, are free to design their own. Many of the rules for existing kits apply, namely: Players need the permission of their DM Only one kit may be taken by a Kits must be chosen when the character in order to adopt a kit; character; is created (with certain exceptions, explained below); and Kits may not be changed or abandoned. An exception to this last rule arises if the DM decides that a character is not living up to the responsibilities of his organization (in the case of the Rangers of the Gnarley Forest, Apprentice to the Magic University, and the various orders of knights). In that event, the player should be warned (perhaps his character has an official meeting with members of the organization, at which he is sanctioned) about the behavior of his character and given a chance to improve. If the PC still falls short of expectations, he might be expelled from the group. The character then loses all benefits, hindrances and bonus proficiencies of the kit. As the PC gains more proficiency slots, they must be filled with the former bonus proficiencies. A note about adding kits: In most cases, ARACTER KITS a kit must be selected for a character when that character is created. The exception lies in the orders of knights and rangers in the GREYHAWK setting. Because some of the orders have a minimum level requirement or demand evidence of heroic deeds, a newly created first-level character will not qualify. Even a newly created character of a higher level may not qualify; a DM may wish a PC to prove himself before granting him a certain kit. In these cases, the player and DM should discuss what is required for the PC to be accepted into his desired group, and engage in role-playing opportunities to allow him the chance to fulfill his requirements. DETAILS OF THE KITS Each kit is defined according to specific terms, though the kits for thugs and dwurfolk are less rigidly defined. Eligible Class: Kits are designed to be used by one specific character dass, identified here. Description: The Lnction, demands and responsibilities of the kit are explained, and any special requirements are listed. Role: The purpose of the kit is defined as well as the societal status of its members. Secondary Skills: If your DM uses the Secondary Skills rules, the kit may require a certain skill rather than allowing a choice or random die roll. Weapon Proficiencies: If you’re using the optional weapon proficiency rules, the kit may require a specific weapon proficiencv or a choice from a limited Prom (these are not L I

0 I \

bonus proficiencies unless noted). Any departures from normal character dass rules are noted here. In the case of the knightly orders which may be added later in a character‘s career, these proficiencies should be considered prerequisites to admission into the kit. Nonweapon Proficiencies: If you’re using the optional rules for nonweapon proficiencies, kits may grant bonus proficiencies in addition to the character’s normal number of slots; these are detailed here. Any recommended profic proficiencies are acquired at the time the character is admitted to the kit. The nonweapon proficiency rules are highly recommended for players wishing to use kits. Equipment: Equipment required to adopt a kit or granted upon admittance to a kit is listed here. Special Benefits: Kits may afford benefits that cannot be defined in game mechanics; these are listed here. Such benefits may include hospitality, reputation, social status and so on. Special Hindrances: Kits may require rigorous training, monetary support of an organization or other demands on a character’s time or resources. These are listed here. Wealth Options: Any financial obligations or requirements associated with the kit are given here. Races: Some races may be barred from certain kits: thev are listed in this entrv. 1 3 Description: This association of 200-plus rangers has as its primary goal the protection of the Gnarley Forest. Its concern lies with the health of the forest: its members care little for the politics that may surround it, except as the directly affect it. While the rangers would not wish to see the entire forest fall under the control of the City of Greyhawk (or any faction, for that matter), it welcomes the assistance of the Greyhawk Militia in protecting the Gnarley and its dwellers. each is likely to have favored sections where he knows the residents and the terrain This group is loosely organized. No individual is responsible for certain territory, hut especially well. The group does not have leaders who give orders, but instead recognizes a number of Ranger Knights who meet every two or three months at Corustaith to exchange information. These Ranger Knights are also responsible for training younger rangers; the younger rangers swear a personal allegiance to their knight, promising to protect the forest, help good folk in need, and revere a good deity (usually Ehlonna). Rangers of any level may join this group. A hopeful ranger must locate one of the I 1 ,

. Ranger Knights, undergo an interview process and a number of wilderness tests and offer several references. Role: The Gnarley Rangers are known for their efforts in protecting this vast woodland. They monitor lumbering, flush out bandits and humanoids and safeguard the humans who dwell in the forest. Enemies indude the orcs, gnolls and ogres of the Blackthorn cavern, occasional humanoid patrols from the Pomarj, and evil cult members who have been chased from neighboring states and now skulk in the Gnarley. RANGERS OF THE GNARLEY FOREST Junior Cadet Senior Ranger Knight Secondary Skills: Required: Bowyer/fletcher, forester, hunter, OR trapper/furrier. Weapon Proficiencies: Required: how (any), dagger or knife. Recommended: axe (any), sling, spear, sword (any). Nonweapon Proficiencies: Bonus: Animal lore, survival (woodland). Recommended: Bowyer/fletcher, direction sense, fire- building, hunting, modern languages (elvish, gnomish, pixie, nixie, treant), rope use, set snares, weather sense. Equipment No equipment is required to become a Gnarley Ranger, hut each member knows he is responsible for his own weapons, rations, survival equipment and other goods to provide for comfort in the wild. All rangers are given an oakleaf insignia which identifies their membership and rank in the group. Special Benefits: The rangers are a team that will come to the aid of their brothers and sisters at the first cry for help. They use a secret code of whistles and chirps that can summon aid almost immediately (if someone is within earshot). They also have a secret language made up of verbal and nonverbal cues. So subtle is this system that two Gnarley Rangers might use the code amid a group without the nonrangers even realizing that they are doing so. The system works well for communicating basic ideas and information about weather, forest conditions, strangers and so on, hut has no applications for abstract concepts. The Rangers have a working knowledge of the secret druidic language. It functions as a thief's Read Languages skill (spoken word only) at 5% per experience level above the first. They also make use of a complex set of symbols that involve scratches on trees or logs, woven tree branches and marks on other forest plants to advise their fellow rangers of nearby dangers or resources. It is said by some that these rangers have gained the cooperation of the wild animals from time to time. This most often involves animals dragging a wounded ranger to safety or providing a warning that danger is imminent. Gnarley Rangers can gain hospitality Player's Guide to Greyhawk 54 PLAYER-CHARACTER KITS from all the folk of the woodlands merely by showing their insignia. Those who are native to the Gnarley Forest are 90% capable of identifying plants, animals and safe fiesh water within the forest. Special Hindrances: Gnarley Rangers must stay close to the Gnarley Forest. They may spend no more than six months at a time away from the forest. For longer journeys, rangers normally seek the approval (they do not need actual permission) of their Ranger Knight. A ranger who spends too much time away from the forest without good reason may be asked to turn in his oak leaves. Rangers do not get along well in cities. They may be perceived as easy targets for cheats and con games. They may forget matters of etiquette or be uncomfortable in the urban environment, resulting in penalties to reaction checks, outrageously inflated prices (“Hey, look at Jungle Jim! He couldn’t possibly know that an evening meal doesn’t cost 12 gold pieces!”) or other minor but annoying troubles. Wealth Options: Normal for rangers. Since the Gnarley Rangers tend to live off the land and have little opportunity for earning money, they usually get by on much less gold (and have less need for it) than other rangers. Races: Any human except Rhennee, half- elf. Werebears and swanmays can also be Gnarley Rangers. KNIGHTS OF HOW SHIELDING Eligible Class: Paladin. Description: This elite band of knights was once the core of the army of the Shield Lands. This army came together as a result of the petty nobles of the region banding together for their mutual protection. At the time, Holmer, Earl of Walworth, served as their commander in chief. Since his capture and death, his cousin Katarina has taken his title and stepped in to lead the knights. The Shield Lands were left in ruin during the Greyhawk Wars, the capital (and knights’ headquarters) of Admundfort was seized, and the knights were left with nothing to defend. In 587 CY, Katarina led the 55 knights in an attempt to reclaim the Shield Lands, regaining Critwall, but that fight is ongoing. Many knights are involved in this war, but others are currently scattered throughout the City of Greyhawk, Dyvers, the Duchy of Urnst and Furyondy, working as mercenaries and sending the revenue to support their army. Young paladins hoping to one day join the Knights of Holy Shielding would do well to offer their services as volunteers or by taking positions as acolytes and squires. Paladins must be of at least seventh level in order to join the group and must provide evidence of a heroic deed. Inductions into the group are done in a private ceremony at the temple of the inductee’s deity (most often Heironeous). Role: The Knights of Holy Shielding, since their organization, have served as the moral and physical centers of the Shield Lands armies. Their valor, faith and bravery have inspired the many troops that followed under their wing. They are well respected by the folk in their homeland, but are despised by Iuz and his followers, from whom they hope to redaim the Shield Lands. Secondary Skills: Required: Armorer, groom, OR weaponsmith. Weapon Proficiencies: Required: Lance (any), morning star, sword (any except short). Recommended: Battle axe, crossbow, horseman’s mace, horseman’s pick, polearm (any), warhammer. Nonweapon Proficiencies: Bonus: Animal handling, riding (land-based). Recommended: Animal training, armorer, blacksmithing, heraldry, languages (any), religion, weaponsmithing. Equipment: Before the Shield Lands were conquered by Iuz, each knight was provided with two weapons, a suit of field plate armor and a mount. Now each member maintains her own armor and new members must own at least two battle weapons, a decent suit of armor (chain mail or better), a shield bearing the coat of arms of the Shield Lands and a mount. Special Benefits: Currently, members of the knighthood stand to gain few benefits. The knights have an excellent information network, and any member (or friend of a member) can pass along requests for i*mation and be assured that the message will reach every knight within a week. The order has made some progress in helping to track down certain evil artifacts and factions. After six months, a Knight can gain +I to attacks against humanoids known to be in the service of Iuz. Special Hindrances: The Knights of the Holy Shielding have limited financing. Agents of Iuz and many other evil cults are eager to exterminate them. Wealth Options: Because of current conditions, many knights are forced to work as mercenaries. Races: Any human except Rhennee. KNIGHTS OF THE WATCH Description: Traditionally, the Knights of the Watch were the cream of the crop from the armies of Bissel, Gran March, Geoff and Keoland. Sworn to protect the eastern lands from Baklunish threats from the west, they maintained a number of castles, keeps and strongholds along the Ket border and in the western mountains. At one time numbering 6,500, the Knights of the Watch currently have fewer than 2,500 members. The humanoid and giant invasion of Geoff cut their numbers considerably, as did Ket’s invasion of Bissel. Known for their strict discipline and near- monastic habits, they may have been so entrenched in the traditional warfare techniques that they were unprepared for the guerrilla tactics of the humanoids, giants and certain Ket factions. knights that still drill and patrol in Gran March, Bissel and Keoland, stand on tradition The Knights of the Watch have split into two divisions. The first, comprised of c replacc : When Specia absenc is reqL strateg the we Weak Races: L Eligib Secon, weapo Weapc Battle; Play e no reason to change habits or tactics; they still call themselves Knights of the L, but are commonly called Watchers by outsiders.

They call themselves ts of Dispatch. Currently funded by the powers of Gran March and Keoland, the tchers feel they must show some return for their work or the aid may dry up.

Special Benefits: Dispatchers can expect hospitality anywhere in the realms they protect and can depend on their fellows for aid. Dispatchers choose one type of humanoid as a sworn enemy; after six months in the order, they gain a 2-point bonus to attack rolls versus that race. Special Hindrances: The Dispatchers are only marginally funded at present; unless they establish themselves, their aid is likely to cease. Wealth Options: As per character class. Races: Any human, half-elf, dwarf. KNIGHTS OF WE ORDER OF WE HAR~ Description: The Knights of the Order of the Hart were organized to assure that Furyondy, Veluna and High Folk retained their freedom and purpose. Historically, these three had difficulty maintaining a standing military. Nobles and lords each kept their own guards, men-at-arms and small bodies of troops, but mustering them in emergencies took too much time, The Knights of the Hart solved this problem, taking oath to be constantly battle-ready. The Knights of the Hart regard Iuz as their greatest enemy and will do anything possible to stop him. They maintain strongholds such as Castle Hart, serve in the courts of their nations and support troops that scout hostile areas and the borders. Due to heavy fatalities during the Wars, the Order's battle-readiness has suffered somewhat. The Order of the Hart is divided into three branches. Knights of Furyondy: This branch once counted more than 200 knights in its PLAYER-CHARACTER KITS order, but is now struggling to reach 170. Its major concerns are recruitment and the maintenance of its strongholds such as Castle Hart. These knights are not likely to directly guard the City of Greyhawk, but may watch over the nearby realms of Dyvers and Verbobonc, in particular trying to protect their trade; despite this, Dyvers and Verbobonc do not trust them, suspecting that the Knights would be happiest with the two realms absorbed into Furyondy. The Knights of Furyondy accept human and half-elf fighters, paladins and rangers of third level and higher who pass their tests. A new recruit is not considered accepted until a current member volunteers to oversee her training. Knights of Velunz Numbering around 120, these knights have begun to increase their ranks again following the Wars. Once almost entirely made up of seasoned veterans (7th-level fighters and higher), the group has opened its ranks to fighting priests. Because most members are land owners or are closely tied to seats of power, diplomacy is a major concern. This branch accepts human and half-elf fighters and human paladins of at least fifth level, and human and half-elf priests of at least sixth level: half-elf priests must worship a human deity. Knights of Veluna are likely to worship Rao, but may revere other lawful-good deities instead, such as St. Cuthbert. Knights of the High Forest: An order made up exclusively of elves, this branch currently has only 45 members. They are involved in guerrilla warfare in the Vesve Forest as well as with trade; they are not merchants, but they need the income. These knights accept elf fighters and rangers of at least fourth level. Role: Knights of the Order of the Hart spend time policing their realms, maintaining their strongholds, tending to their armories to ensure battle-readiness and drilling. They are respected by the folk of their nations but have a long- standing rivalry with the Knights of the Holy Shielding. The Knights of the Hart feel that the Knights of Shielding behaved foolishly when they missed Iuz’s attack on their country, and refused aid 57 -- from Furyondy until it was too late. The Knights dislike the City of Dyvers for declaring independence from Furyondy. Some hostility exists between the Hart and the rulers of Perrenland and the Nyrondese nobles. The Hart and the Watchers have no use for each other. Membership in any of the three branches is limited to freemen and -women who have demonstrated their allegiance to the three states they are sworn to protect. This proof of allegiance must be shown in deeds as well as words; those who merely make speeches can hardly be considered knights. Each branch has tests of skill, bravery, quickness and diplomacy that must be passed. Anyone hoping to contact the knights might do so through Sir Lemajen Sterrich. A high-ranking member of the order, he maintains a residence in the Foreign Quarter of the City of Greyhawk. Knights of the Order can be found visiting the City of Greyhawk to consult with Sir Lemajen or recruit new members. Knights of Furyondy Eligible Classes: Fighter, paladin, ranger. Secondary Skills: Required: Armorer, groom, navigator, OR weaponsmith. Weapon Proficiencies: Required: lance (any) and sword (any except short), plus choose polearm (any) OR battle axe.

Equipment: Initiates are expected to provide their own mount, a suit of decent armor (rangers maybe waived from this d e ) ,  and two battle weapons. Members are expected to maintain their own equipment. Knights can sometimes offer assistance to worthy members who cannot afford this equipment or who need to replace items (especially horses) that are destroyed in battle. The order provides all members with a tabard (golden stag’s antlers on an azure background) and other insignia of the order. Special BenefitsThe knights may ask for assistance or hospitality from the members of any of the three orders at any time. Knights of Furyondy receive a small stipend (2 gp per week) to assist in their upkeep. They may request audience with the rulers of Furyondy, Veluna and Highfolk, and in most cases will be heard within 24 hours. Knights who petition rulers for aid for a mission that might assist the re& (tracking down evil artifacts, destroying fiends and so on) stand a fair chance of getting it (the DM can determine any ability or proficiency checks that may apply). Special Hindrances: Knights of Furyondy are expected to be battle-ready at all times. They must notify a superior when traveling beyond the boundaries of Furyondy, Veluna and Highfolk; superiors decide whether a traveling knight must return in the event of a battle or whether she is excused from it. Iuz has taken a special interest in destroying all the knightly orders; any member may find herself pursued by fiends or agents of ILIZ at any time. Wealth Options: As per rules for character class. Races: Any human, half-elf. Knights of Veluna Eligible Class: Fighter, paladin, priest. Secondary Skills: Required: Armorer, groom, OR weaponsmith.

II Benefits: While the knights are expected to live off the land and fend for elves, they are also encouraged to take their meals with any household they might nter. It is considered a great honor for a family to feed or house a knight. ghts of the High Forest are paid a stipend of 1 gp per week for their upkeep. ause these knights are skilled in woodland combat and they know the forest well, iay secretly observe or track an intruder for one full turn to gain a combat .age. Following a successful Wisdom check, the knight (and his party, if any) gains vantage of surprise plus initiative for the first round. A knight may study an enemy nce per combat to gain this advantage, though he can use this ability again in an nter several days later. ghts of the High Forest who have been in the order for a year or more may have edge of magical glades, stands of treants, or other unusual features in their woods. tl Hindrances: This order of knights has few resources, and the knights elves are spread a bit thin. They tend to travel alone to cover the most ground, vulnerable to attack. They are expected to remain within five miles of the Vesve , and must seek permission of a superior to venture more than a day’s travel away h e  area. A knight who spends six months or more exclusively in the forest may suffer a 1- or 2-point penalty to ability or proficiency checks dealing with diplomacy, etiquette, or similar skills when in the presence of nobles or rulers. His skills have merely grown rusty; a few days or weeks in a court setting will eliminate these penalties. Iuz or his followers may pursue a member at any time. Wealth Options: As per rules for character class. Races: Elf, half-elf. APPREmKEs To THE UNIVERSITY OF MAGICAL ARTS Eligible Class: Wizard. Description: Located in the City of Greyhawk, this prestigious institution is also known as the Wizard School or College of Magic. Its students are admitted by invitation only, and are trained by the finest magical minds on the continent. Students of all levels (including 0-level) may be admitted. A student typically spends a year or two in her first term at the college, then may go off adventuring and return later for further instruction. The university is a good way for a character who wishes to become dual-classed to get started in her new career. Role: Students and teachers at the university are highly respected by everyone who has heard of the school. Members are sometimes sought out by desperate folk in need of magical aid; the school favors charity work and likes to hear of several incidences of pro bono spellcasting per year from each member. Secondary Skills: For 0- or 1st-level characters, Scribe. For higher levels, any. Weapon Proficiencies: Required: Dagger, darts, knife, sling, staff. Nonweapon Proficiencies: Bonus: Spellcrak Recommended: Astrology, herbalism, reading/writing, languages (ancient). Equipment: In order to enter the university, 0- and 1st-level characters need no equipment. At higher levels, at least one spellbook with pages to record new spells is required. When a term of study is yer‘s Guide to Greyhawk 58 PLAYER-CHARACTER KITS finished, 0- and 1st-level characters may take the spellbooks they’ve constructed with them; at higher levels, a magical item of appropriate power may be granted (a potion or scroll for lower levels, a ring or wand for higher levels). Special Benefits: For each course of study (minimum of one year) in the college, a wizard may memorize one additional spell per day (one per level beginning with 1st level). She may cast only the number of spells appropriate to her level. Thus, a 1st- level wizard who has studied at the university for at least a year may memorize two 1st-level spells rather than just one, but may cast only one of those spells in a day. A 7th-level wizard may normally memorize four 1st-level, three 2nd-level, two 3rd-level and one 4th-level spell for a given day. If Evaine the wizard studied at the university for two courses of study (one course during first level and one during fourth level), she could memorize five 1st-level, four 2nd-level, two 3rd-level, and one 4th level spell for a day, but she may cast only the number of spells normally allowed. After casting her limit of spells of a certain level - for example, four 1st-level spells - the additional memorized spell of that level (the fifth 1st-level spell) is wiped from Evaine’s memory. Special Hindrances: Students are required to remain close to the facility (in general, within a 50-mile radius of the City of Greyhawk) and to gain permission to go adventuring during the course of study. If an adventuring party petitions the staff and the instructors feel that a field mission would benefit the student, permission may be granted for the pupil to accompany her regular adventuring group on an expedition. An instructor may be assigned to chaperone, observe and advise. This kit is an excellent solution for a player who may be forced to spend time away from his regular gaming group. Wealth Options: Students of zero or first level who enter the school usually have a sponsor who makes a donation on the student’s behalf. The faculty does accept those who have no money. A student entering the university at a higher level 59 is usually expected to make a donation of about 30 gp per level. When zero and first level students are ready to leave, they are granted the starting money stated in the Player’s Handbook of (ld4+1) X 10 gp. Pupils of higher level are expected to support themselves, but the school subsidizes at the same rate those who are truly needy. Races: No one can remember a halfling or dwarf ever attending the school, but that’s not to say one wouldn’t be accepted. Humans are the most common students, followed by half-elves and elves. A few gnomes have studied here. No Rhennee have ever attended. GREVHAWK THUGS Eligible C1ass:Thief (not smart or skilled enough to be multiclassed). Description: Thugs are thieves who rely on brute force to commit their crimes. Large cities have long known the presence of thugs employed by criminal gangs, unprincipled merchant guilds and port authorities. Thugs enforce protection rackets, hijack shipments, serve as bodyguards, provide backup muscle on heists, and intimidate victims and law enforcers alike. A thug is a violent, frightening figure, nearly always male (except in Hardby) and heavily armed. In some cities, highly paid thugs are unofficially used to keep order in lawless or rebellious neighborhoods, though they are corrupt “peacekeepers” at best. Thugs are most common in major trade cities, particularly seaports and river towns where thieves are common, protection rackets are well entrenched, and large shipments of valuable goods exist to be protected or hijacked. If the city has a general alignment that is not Good, thugs are all the more likely to exist. Within these parameters, thugs are frequently seen in the cities of Greyhawk, Dyvers, Safeton, Nanvell and Hardby, as well as in other major cities of the Wild Coast and Pomarj, the Hold of the Sea Princes, the former Great Kingdom (especially along the rivers and coasts), the Sea Barons, the Lordship of the Isles, Dullstrand and Iuz’s Empire (especially in the Bandit Lands). Hardby thugs are very often human women, as this city was once ruled by a gynarchy and has a strong female culture. Half-orc thugs have more restricted origins because of their unpopularity, but many hail from Highport, Stoink, Prymp and Re1 Astra. Most half-orcs in the northern Wild Coast were slain in 584 CY, in reaction to the rise of the Orcish Empire in the Pomarj under Turrosh Mak. High-level half-orcs are similarly rare in the City of Greyhawk, apparently because they were targeted for assassination by persons unknown. The Guild of Assassins in Greyhawk never used half-orcs until after the departure of Turin Deathstalker, rumored to be the Guildmaster, for a position as commander of the Safeton garrison of the Greyhawk Militia. Role: A thug is unimaginative and brutish, unconcerned with larger issues of morality so long as he is well paid and gets to scare people. A thug on an adventure would function as a part-time fighter with mediocre thief skills; still, some dungeoneering groups aren’t choosy about their companions. A demihuman thug is surely an outcast from his people and homeland, possibly wanted there or elsewhere for past crimes. A half-orc thug is actually doing fairly well, all things considered, as many other half-orcs are beggars, peasants, laborers, or low-dass soldiers or militiamen. It is easily possible to add more depth to this picture. A thug could have grave anxieties and doubts about his abilities and feel he constantly needs to prove himself, He could have a rough sense of honor and fight worthy opponents fairly, proving himself loyal to a strong leader. He might vent his rage on evil beings, religions, or groups that harmed him in the past, buying drinks for friends using the money he loots from his foes (a crude sort of Robin Hood). He could be rather charming for a brutal outlaw, or he could be played with a comic touch as a dull-witted tough with overdone, stereotyped mannerisms. Secondary Skills: Gambler, groom, mason, miner, sailor or teamster/freighter. ed: See “Special Benefits”; otherwise, any ion (PHBR2 The Complete ThifS Handbook). Recommended Alertness (PHBR2), animal handling, blacksmithing, endurance (PHBR2), gaming, looting (PHBRZ), local history (for one city), looting (PHBR2), mining, seamanship (if sailor), stonemasonry, swimming (if sailor), trailing (PHBR2). Equipment: No bonus equipment is gained. A thug is usually unkempt and unwashed, seedy and suspicious in behavior, and physically powerful in appearance. Armor and dothing may show off arm and chest musculature, and bits of stolen jewelry (rings, necklaces, bracelets and so forth) may be displayed. At least one and sometimes many weapons are in evidence; if an unusual weapon is used, it will be displayed. Other smaller weapons are kept hidden on the thugs person. Criminal gang insignia, unlawful religious symbols, tattoos, scars, bruises and crude language are typical. Armor, weapons, and other possessions are rarely of good quality but are always well used. Special Benefits: A thug gains a bonus weapon proficiency slot at 1st level, and he has the owed to thieves. This non-thief weapon footman’s weapon, hand axe, morning star, scourge, war hammer or whip. The weapon costs only 1 proficiency slot to learn. No other non-thief weapon can be learned at higher levels. At the DMs option, the thug can instead learn to use an unusual weapon from The Cmpkte Fighter’s Handbook or Purut’s Opnoiv: Combat & Tactics tome, such as the cestus, belaying pin, chain, gaff/hook, net, shuriken or stiletto. Some unusual weapons are appropriate for thugs who double as sailors, particularly foreign weapons that could be picked up on long overseas journeys. All future weapon slots should be filled with normal thieves’ weapons, as per the PHB. The thug can also choose at any time from three new weapon proficiencies detailed in The g and wrestling. Each costs 1 slot for the A thug gains a +I bonus on all combat attack rolls, whether with hand-to-hand ’ weapons or fists. This bonus does not apply to missile weapons. This reflects the thugs greater-than-usual ability with physical attacks. Backstabbing functions normally for the thug as for other thieves, though again with a +1 bonus to the attack roll beyond the +4 bonus for backstabbing and any other bonuses for Strength or use of a magical weapon. When rolling for hit points, a thug rolls ld4+2 points per level instead of ld6. At 3rd level, therefore, the thug would roll 3d4+12 hit points, plus normal bonus hit points for high Constitution scores (+I or +2 per hit die). The upper range for hit points is the same as for normal thieves, but the thug has a higher average hit-point total, allowing him to withstand melee combat A thug can gain nonweapon proficiencies from the Warrior category without paying for them with additional slots-in other words, at the normal “slot cost” for such proficiencies. Proficiencies from the Wizard or Priest groups, however, cost one additional proficiency slot each, as usual. If the DM permits, a thug can don heavier armor than normally allowed to thieves. However, this armor imposes severe penalties on thieving skills. Use Table 38 in The Conplete Tbif’s Handbook for hll penalty information. If this option is used to allow the thug to wear armor heavier than studded leather (base AC 7), the thug should gain only 20 points per level after the 1st to distribute to his thieving skills, allotting 10 points at most to any one skill. A thug cannot learn to use a shield; he wants both hands “free.” successful proficiency chedc at +1 on the die roll (making the check more difficult) grants the thug knowledge of focal escape routes, hiding places and safehouses he can use to evade capture, if he is in trouble at any particular spot in the city. This check won’t work for any other city but the one for which the proficiency is ’assigned. This check may also be used to find special contacts such as smugglers, fences, or other criminal representatives. If the local history proficiency is taken strictly for a city that the thug inhabits, a Special Hindrances: A thug cannot start out with an Intelligence higher than 12. Minimum ability scores of Dexterity 9, Constitution 11 and Strength 13 are required. compared to other thieves, he is worse at using normal thieving skills as he relies more on taking wealth from others by force instead of by stealth. As a result, the thug gains only 40 points to distribute among his thief skills at 1st level (not counting racial and dexterity factors), but can put up to 30 of those points in a single skill if desired. Additional points are received with each level as per the PHB (30 points per level, maximum of 15 points per one skill). A thug does not gain any ability to read languages, however, and he cannot use magical or clerical scrolls when he reaches 10th level. He can learn to read or write Common, orcish, or other languages, but he cannot take these as bonus proficiencies. He must take a normal reading/writing proficiency, expending slots as per normal. He can thus gain the readinglwriting proficiency at 1st level, A thug at 10th level gains followers, but these will all be fighters or thieves. Thugs are the bottom of the criminal barrel, the lowlifes everyone loves to hate. As a lower-class individual who cannot start out with a good alignment, a thug faces considerable prejudice in many encounters. Normal NPC citizens automatically gain a +2 modifier to their reaction rolls to those they perceive as thugs, creating very hostile responses (though unarmed civilians will flee instead of fighting). This increases to a +4 modifier if the thug is a half-orc. Other thieves and criminals have no such penalty toward thugs, as they see thugs as potentially useful, loyal, and - when necessary - expendable. Wealth Options: Thugs start with 2d4x10 Races: Any human, half-orc, dwarf, half-elf. Though the thug is very good at combat ’ (2o-w gP* Player’s Guide to Greyhawk 60 PLAYER-CHARACTER KITS 61 Half-orcs as Thugs Half-orcs have marked advantages over humans as thugs, but in the GREYHAWK campaign they have severe disadvantages, too. On the good side, their 60-foot infravision makes them very useful for operations at night, underground or in dark alleys. They have no visual penalties in full daylight, d i k e  orcs. They make excellent go-betweens with orcs or other humanoids, as they have few or no tribal loyalties. And they can be very loyal troops, as they have so few other places to turn to for gainful employment. Wars and subsequent events, half-orcs are extremely unpopular in cities bordering lands conquered by Turrosh Mak’s Orcish Empire of the Pomarj, the vast Empire of I-, Bone March, the Great Kingdom of Northern Aerdy, the Yeomanry and the now-free land of Sterich. In many lands, a half-orc is open to physical attack immediately upon being recognized; those in Safeton and Narwell were exterminated in 584 CY in a single night’s violence. Nonetheless, half-orc thugs of non-evil (and non-good) alignment can make a good living as low- to mid-level adventurers. They present a reasonable mix of fighting and thieving skills, advance much more quickly than fighter/thief characters, and can largely overcome level limits on their advancement with the right mix of magical items and proficiencies. Of course, in the wake of the Greyhawk Half-Orc Statistics (adapted from PHBRlO The CompLte Book .f Humanoids) Ability Score Adjustments: +I Strength, +I Constitution, -2 Charisma. Ability Score Range (same for males and females): Strength: 6-18 (18/00 possible for fightersy Dexterity: 3-17** Constitution: 13-19 Intelligence: 3-17 Wisdom: 3-14 Charisma: 3-12 Classes Allowed (Maxunum Level): Fighter (IO), Cleric (4).

Mdticlassing Allowed: fighter/thief, fighter/cleric, deric/thief. (Reminder: A thief with the thug kit cannot be multiclassed) The shaman kit, as per PHBRlO The Compkte Book of Humanoids, can replace the cleric class, but it does not allow for broad adventuring.

If discovered, they are usually rejected and despised by both orcish and human society, but they are still able to achieve considerable power through their own efforts. (Turrosh Mak is a prime example of this.) A half-orc usually finds it cannot appear weak, injured or cowardly and expect to live long; this often promotes an unusually serious, forceful personality well suited for adventuring and harsh military duty. A half-orc may have a predisposition from an orcish parent toward brute-force aggression, lawfulness, dominance hierarchies, egotism, brutality, male superiority, a hatred of demihumans, disrespect for the weak and a carnivorous appetite, but the player may apply any personality desired. Half-orcs are usually free of all tribal ties binding orcish relatives, especially if raised in human society. In the Domain of Greyhawk, half-orcs are rare but not unknown. They are very few in number near the border with the Orcish Empire of the Pomarj, as a result of extreme racial prejudice and paranoia of orcish invasion and infiltration. However, the City of Greyhawk has long had a small population of half-ora, even when the former Oligarch Turin Deathstalker (rumored to have been the Guildmaster of Assassins in Greyhawk) was in the area. The most important “open” half-orc at present is the aging but still active and infamous Selczek Gobayuik, Guildmaster of Embalmers and Gravediggers, who works and lives in the River Quarter. Kara Hold. tunn GOW Pop1 P l a PLAVER-CHARACTER KITS Typical Personality: Law-abiding, hard- working, respectful of elders, greatly inclined to educated interests (especially fine arts), independent, proud, highly insular and reclusive, self-sufficient. Emnomy: Iron armor, tools, weapons manufactured for sale or trade: silver and gems (especially moonstones) mined and worked into jewelry and other works of art for sale or trade. Concerns: Clan doesn’t fully accept Greyhawk‘s rule, and the dwarves still pay a small tribute to Urnst out of habit. Skirmishes occur now and then with humanoids, ogres, hill giants, hillfolk and monsters from the Abbor-Alz, and bandits from the Duchy of Urnst. Special abilities: All Dwur of Greyhawk PCs have the following standard special abilities common to other dwarf characters, as per the PHB, Chapter 2: Saving-throw bonuses vs. poison and magical wands, staves, rods and spells for dwarves (as perTable 9 in the PHB); 20% chance for magical-item malfunction; +I attack-roll bonus vs. om, half-orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins: Defensive bonuses (-4 to attack rolls) applied against all ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants and titans who fight dwarves: 60-foot infravision in darkness: and Abilities to detect underground (dungeon or mining) phenomena. Ability RequwmentJ: Normally, a dwarf character gains a +I bonus to the rolled Constitution score and a -I penalty to the Charisma score. These ability adjustments change for characters from two of the h e

Yes, for clerics only Exceptional Strength? Yes, for fighters only Exceptional Constitution? Yes, for fighters only Proficiencies: Weapons Slots: Standard per class Initial Weapons: (2H = must be used two-handed by dwarves.) Clrric As prescribed by religion. The religions of Ulaa, Moradin and Clangeddin allow clerics to take proficiency in normal fighter weapons, but each requires one special weapon be selected at 1st level by the cleric. Ulaa’s clerics must take a war hammer or footman’s pick; Moradin’s clerics must take a war hammer: and Clangeddin’s clerics must take a battle axe (no shield). Fight: Typical weapons include the battle axe (2H), hand axe, light crossbow (2H), heavy crossbow (2H), dagger, war hammer, knife, footman’s flail (2H), footman’s mace (2H), footman’s pick (2H), spear (2H), and short swotd. The broad sword (2H) and long sword (2H) are not often seen. Other weapons are possible, such as small, one-handed (equal to horseman’s) versions of the flail, mace, and pick, the hand crossbow, clubs, darts, and the short bow (greatly preferred by hunters over the crossbow). ni$ Typical weapons include the hand axe, club, dagger, dart, hand crossbow, knife, lasso, short bow, sling and short sword. Armor typical for clerics and fighters is chain mail or better, with a helmet and a small or medium shield. (Shield use depends on the weapons employed.) Karakast thief-scouts wear leather armor but use no shields unless they are fighter/thieves. Each dwarf‘s shield usually carries the coat of arms of the dwarf‘s clan stronghold.

Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: All dwarves, whether from Greysmere, Karakast or Dumadan, receive automatic proficiencies in speaking, reading and writing the following languages: dwarvish and Common. They can choose to learn to speak the following languages, but must use a proficiency slot in language (modern) to learn each one: gnomish, halfling, orcish, goblin, hill giant. They can also use nonweapon proficiency slots to gain read/write proficiencies for the same languages. It is strongly recommended that the number of languages allowed each character by Intelligence, as shown in Table 4 of the PHB, be taken instead as nonweapon proficiency slots, as per the optional rule offered in the section on Intelligence. All dwarves from Greysmere, Karakast and Dumadan also gain two bonus proficiencies: endurance and local history (clan stronghold). No slots are expended in acquiring these skills. Required Nonweapon Proficiencies: A 1st-level dwarf fighter from each stronghold must take at least one of the following nonweapon proficiencies, which reflects particular skills often seen from those strongholds.

Dungeon Module T0 Journey to Hommlet By Joseph Bloch INTRODUCTORY TO NOVICE LEVEL Bandits and brigands are once more threatening commerce in the Gnarley Forest. Commerce to and from the Wild Coast is threatened, and the leading merchants of Narwell are determined to root out the bandits behind the raids. You have been hired to accompany a small merchant caravan through the forest in an effort to flush out the bandits and stop them once and for all, if you can. This module contains a map of the forest, detailed maps of the bandit hideouts, and information on the many encounters that can be found in the forest. The whole scenario can be used as a lead-in to MODULE T1, THE VILLAGE OF HOMMLET, which itself leads into THE TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL. Journey to Hommlet is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content Policy. Not approved/endorsed by Wizards.

Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Module #T0 Journey to Hommlet By Joseph Bloch BACKGROUND This adventure module is presented as an expansion and embellishment of the classic AD&D adventure T1-4 THE TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL, published by TSR, Inc. in 1985. It can also be used, of course, in conjunction with adventure T1 THE VILLAGE OF HOMMLET, published in 1979. It also be used in conjunction with the previously published adventure module T5 BENEATH THE TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL (also published by this author under the Fan Content Policy), although it is not necessary to do so. There is nothing in the present work that requires or refers to the additional material in T5, although they certainly can be used together to embellish the original. This module debuted at the ShireCon 2021 game convention in Falls Village, Connecticut. The most drastic change is that, when using the present book, the PCs do not begin the adventure in the village of Hommlet. Rather, the adventure begins as a rather prosaic hunt for brigands in the Gnarley Forest, and ends up in the famous Village. As the original module states, Lareth the Beautiful and his brigands in the Moathouse are but one of several groups acting on behalf of the resurgent Temple. The present work allows you and your players to explore the machinations of some of those others, thus expanding the possibilities for intrigue once the players reach the Temple itself. It should be noted that some view the mentions of Lolth in the original module as editing errors, claiming they should be read as references to Zuggtmoy. The present work disagrees with this conclusion, and attempts to integrate Lolth, the demon queen of spiders who is worshipped by the drow, as an active force in the Temple. Given her later connections to the Elder Elemental God, this seems appropriate. While this module can be used with the other expansion module in this series, T5 Beneath the Temple of Elemental Evil, it can be used individually as an add-on to the original T1-4. Using this Module with Other Published Adventures As noted above, the present work is intended to be used with the original T1-4 THE TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL or T1 THE VILLAGE OF HOMMLET, and requires that work in order to be played through as intended (although the enterprising DM could of course make an interesting campaign that doesn’t involve the actual Temple itself). Motives and Motivations Although it appears to be a monolithic edifice of evil on the surface, the Temple itself is riven by no fewer than seven factions: • Zuggtmoy: Wants to be released, hopes to resume her place as ruler of the Temple. • Iuz: Wants to keep Zuggtmoy in check, hopes to use a resurgent Temple to distract Furyondy and Veluna. He publicly states he wants to free Zuggtmoy, however. • Lolth: Wants to oppose the Elder Elemental God at all points, hopes to keep the Temple divided and impotent. • Kelno the Prefect: Wants to restore the Temple, hopes to put the Air Temple in the primary position, needs new acolytes. • Romag: Wants to restore the Temple, hopes to put the Earth Temple in the primary position. • Prefect Alrrem: Wants to restore the Temple, hopes to put the Fire Temple in the primary position. • Canon Belsornig: Wants to restore the Temple, hopes to put the Water Temple in the primary position. Not all of these factions are even aware of the others’ existence. Some individuals are playing a double (or even a triple) game, attempting to play one or more factions off each other for their own gain or that of their real master. In the context of the present adventure, only the factions behind the brigand bands are significant. The Moathouse brigands are working for Romag and the Earth Temple, but their leader Lareth the Beautiful is secretly loyal to the demoness Lolth. The bandits in the Abbey are part of the Water Temple faction and are loyal to Canon Belsornig. Finally, the bandits in the Watchtower are loyal to Iuz, but there are some exceptions as noted below. In addition, the Fire, Earth, and Water temples all have spies in each others’ bandit groups, among the common bandits, so everyone knows what everyone else is up to. Players’ Introduction Brigands plague the Gnarley Forest. The tracks through the forest are perilous enough in normal times, but now brigandry in the forest has markedly increased, and the brigands themselves show an unusually high level of organization and coordination. Not even the Rangers of the Gnarley seem able to stem the upsurge in brigandry in their domain. So it is that the leading merchants of the town of Narwell on the Wild Coast have commissioned you to look into the rise in brigandry and stop the attacks. You are offered 500 g.p. for the successful completion of your mission, plus whatever booty you can obtain from the brigands. The merchants will also outfit your expedition with riding horses and other supplies (but not arms or armor). The merchants have arranged for you to accompany a small caravan scheduled to go into the forest in two days’ time. It is carrying cloth from Almor and wine from Onnwal, and will meet up with a much larger caravan once it reaches the village of Hommlet on the far side of the forest. Once the caravan is safely seen to that point, your mission is over, assuming you have managed to retrieve intelligence about the bandits, or even managed to inflict a serious blow to them. You should give a complete report to Burne, the Most Worshipful Mage of Hommlet, who will pay you for your service.

TRAVELING WITH THE CARAVAN The PCs have a full day to purchase any supplies they wish. Assume that any equipment on the standard equipment list (including mounts) is available in Narwell, but this will not leave sufficient time to have custom equipment manufactured. The caravan consists of four ox-drawn carts, each with a driver; two hold wine and two hold cloth. Two merchants (not the ones who hired the PCs, but aware of their mission and happy to have the protection) on horseback accompany the carts. The small caravan’s wares are worth a total of 4,000 g.p., and the trip should take slightly less than two weeks to reach Hommlet, a small village in the Kron Hills. The PCs are expected to provide their own food. Cart 1: Driver (level 0 human, 3 h.p.), merchant Evard Luthwin (level 0 human, 5 h.p., armed with a dagger, has 34 g.p. and 16 s.p. in a belt pouch). Cart holds 6 large barrels of Onnwalish red wine, each worth 100 g.p. and weighing 200 lbs. Cart 2: Driver (level 0 human, 4 h.p.). Cart holds 3 large barrels of Onnwalish red wine and 8 small casks of Onnwalish white wine, each worth 75 g.p. and weighing 30 lbs. One of the casks of white is poisoned; Luthwin intends to do away with the brigands on his own in case they do strike. The barrel is subtly marked. Cart 3: Driver (level 0 human, 3 h.p.), merchant Ewin Rasgor (level 0 human, 4 h.p., armed with a dagger, carries 4 p.p., 27 g.p., and 17 s.p. in a belt pouch). Cart holds 40 bolts of Almorish linen, each worth 25 g.p. and weighing 10 lbs. Cart 4: Driver (level 0 human, 4 h.p.). Cart carries 50 bolts of Almorish wool, each worth 30 g.p. and weighing 12 lbs. Also holds enough food and water for 6 people for two weeks. Because the forest is unclaimed territory, there are no roads directly connecting the Wild Coast to the Kron Hills, so the trip through the Gnarley forest will have to use trails and tracks. There is a veritable maze of such minor passages through the forest, but only those of direct interest to the adventure are noted on the map. All of the drivers (except the driver of cart 4) and both of the merchants have traveled this route before, so there is very little chance of becoming lost unless the PCs find themselves the sole survivors of the caravan. What follows is the ideal route for the caravan. There are various possible encounters, including with three different groups of the brigands, that could happen along the journey, but if brigands have not been encountered randomly before day 11, they will be encountered by fiat. Brigand attacks will happen during the day 1/3 of the time, and at night while the caravan is encamped 2/3 of the time. When a roll indicates to “add 1 to encounter rolls” on future days, those modifiers are cumulative, only resetting after a brigand encounter has occurred, unless otherwise noted. In addition to the encounters below, there is a 25% chance per day that the caravan will pass another, similar, caravan traveling in the opposite direction. None will have any information about the bandits, but passing such a caravan adds an additional +1 to the encounter chart for that day only. Note that if and when the PCs go off the trail to pursue the brigands, the timeline ends and encounters would be dealt with per the location descriptions. The end point of each day’s travel is indicated on the map by the day where the caravan ends; 1 is the end of the first day, 2 is the end of the second day, etc. Finally, unbeknownst to the PCs, the merchants have also alerted the Gnarley Rangers to the mission. At the discretion of the DM, if the PCs are in a battle which is over their head, one of the rangers will be watching from the trees, and will intervene on their behalf, as he has been following them since they entered the forest (“I’ve been your guardian angel” he will say of asked). Once he does so, he will leave the caravan in order to report back to his fellow rangers. If the PCs are stuck for a means to locate the bandits who attacked them, he can also point them in the right direction.

Aaron Foxear, 3rd level ranger; HP: 22; S15, I 14, W14, D15, C14, Ch12; +1 chain mail and shield (AC 2 with DEX bonus), long sword, long bow with 20 arrows +1, 2 potions of extra healing. He is neutral good. Aaron comes across as competent but standoffish, and will be disdainful of the PCs, as they took on an assignment obviously beyond their capabilities, commenting on their performance, but is dedicated to his mission and will begin to warm to the PCs if they press on despite their initial failure. He will give them his potions as a gesture of respect. Day 1 The caravan leaves Narwell heading due west towards the Jewel River and the Gnarley Forest. It makes camp on the trail, and the night is uneventful. Day 2 The caravan continues due west, arriving at a ford across the Jewel river in late afternoon. The caravan stays in the small village of Redpatch, on the east bank of the river. The village does not have an inn, and the caravan must overnight in a field nearby. Roll 1d6. On a roll of 1-3, a scout for the brigands has sighted the caravan. Add 1 to all subsequent encounter rolls on days 4 and 5. Day 3 The caravan passes through the village of Dunmarsh on the edge of the forest, and enters the Gnarley near dusk, making camp only a mile or so within its boundaries. The caravan lead drover points out that their pace will slow considerably once they enter the forest, so every mile is precious. Roll 1d6. On a roll of 1-3, a scout for the Abbey brigands has sighted the caravan, unless they have already been sighted. Add 1 to all subsequent encounter rolls on days 4 and 5. Do not add this modifier if the scout sighted the caravan on the previous day. Day 4 The caravan spends its day entirely beneath the canopy of the forest. Towards the end of the day, the trail gets noticeably rougher as it enters more hilly terrain, and thus the caravan moves more slowly. Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1 None 2 Brigand victims 3 Pilgrims of St. Cuthbert 4 Gnarley Forest animal/monster 5 Brigand scout sights the caravan. Add 1 to the encounter roll on day 5. 6+ Abbey brigands attack Day 5 The trail is passing through wooded hills, but is keeping to the lowlands between them, making the going easier for the carts. Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1-2 None 3-4 Jijohn the tinker 5 Gnarley Forest animal/monster 6+ Abbey brigands attack Day 6 Around mid-morning, the caravan crosses a path going across the trail they are following. The caravan goes straight, but there are signs that the path to the north has been used recently.

The caravan has at this point moved out of the territory of the monastery brigands, and is now in the territory of the watchtower brigands. Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1-2 None 3 Woodsmen 4 Gnarley Forest animal/monster 5 Brigand scout sights the caravan. Add 1 to the encounter roll on days 7-11 6 Watchtower brigands attack Day 7 The caravan stops to rest at a crossroads, with a trail going northwest and another going southwest. If asked, the drovers indicate they will be taking the southwest trail, which is longer but safer. Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1 None 2 Brigand victims 3 Xvart band 4 Gnarley Forest animal/monster 5 Brigand scout sights the caravan. Add 1 to the encounter roll on days 8-11 6+ Watchtower brigands attack Day 8 The caravan takes the southwest fork in the trail. Around mid- morning there is another fork in the trail, with one branch continuing southwest and another going due south. The caravan takes the right fork, heading southwest. Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1-2 None 3 Goblin band 4 Gnarley Forest animal/monster 5 Brigand scout sights the caravan. Add 1 to the encounter roll on days 9-11 6+ Watchtower brigands attack Day 9 The track continues on its southwesterly course under the trees, flanked by rolling hills and occasional steep embankments. Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1-2 None 3 Brigand victims 4 Gnarley Forest animal/monster 5 Brigand scout sights the caravan. Add 1 to the encounter roll on days 10-11 6+ Watchtower brigands attack Day 10 The caravan remains under the thick branches of the trees, stopping for the night at a fork, with a smaller trail heading south. In the morning, the caravan will continue westward. Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1-2 None 3 Wood elves 4 Gnarley Forest animal/monster Die Roll (d6) Encounter 5 Brigand scout sights the caravan. Add 1 to the encounter roll on day 11 6+ Watchtower brigands attack Day 11 The caravan finally emerges from the canopy of the forest, making camp in the Kron Hills an hour or so after emerging from the forest. If none of the brigand groups has attacked before now, the Watchtower brigands will attack on this day or evening as the caravan is encamped. If the attack does happen, it is likely that the PCs will direct the caravan to simply continue on to Hommlet, which is only three days away, so that it can make its rendezvous with the larger, northbound caravan. If so, continue with days 12-14. The PCs will need some way to find the Watchtower; most likely one of the bandits from the attack will reveal its location with minimal persuasion. If the caravan has already been attacked, roll normally for random encounters. Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1 None 2 Celense patrol 3 Mining party 4 Hillmen 5 Kron Hills Animal/Monster 6+ Watchtower brigands attack Day 12 The caravan follows the trail through the Kron Hills westward. You see evidence of habitation; occasional isolated farms, The caravan has left the territory of the Watchtower brigands, and is now in the territory of the Moathouse brigands. Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1-2 None 3 Mining party 4 Hillmen 5 Brigand scout sights the caravan. Add 1 to the encounter roll on days 13-14 6 Moathouse brigands attack Day 13 At mid-day the trail intersects the north-south road connecting Celene with Verbobonc. The caravan turns north towards Hommlet. In addition to the random encounter rolled below, the caravan will encounter 1d4 local carts and wagons, traveling slowly from north to south. These are mostly farmers and small traders who live close by, and who are making their way to some nearby village to trade or visit. None will have any information about the brigands, other than the fact that more than a few folk have disappeared without a trace in recent months. Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1 None 2 Kron Hills animal/monster

Die Roll (d6) Encounter 3 Celenese patrol 4 Verbobonc patrol 5 Brigand scout sights the caravan. Add 1 to the encounter roll on day 14 6+ Moathouse brigands attack Day 14 The caravan reaches the village of Hommlet near sunset. The Inn of the Welcome Wench provides a welcome sight indeed, as the prospect of a safe and soft bed, good hot food, and the end of your mission is at hand. The caravan (if it is still intact) meets up with the larger one heading into Verbobonc, and the drovers are quite relieved to be in the relative safety of the village. Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1-3 None 4 Kron Hills animal/monster 5 Verbobonc patrol 6+ Moathouse brigands attack (attack happens before the caravan arrives in Hommlet) Locating Burne and Burne is not at all difficult, and the PCs should be able to make their report and receive their pay. He will not suggest any further actions on his own, but if directly pressed he will prod the PCs with the following. The PCs can, of course, return to the tower and get aid from Burne and Burne as described in T1 THE VILLAGE OF HOMMLET. I suspect so much and know so little. If the old evil really is returning, we must be subtle and not alert it to our awareness. I cannot give you any direct instructions, for I lack the authority to do so. I will say that there are many eyes on this region, some of whom may provide aid to you. But beware! Evil is subtle, and it’s passing hard to tell friend from foe. if you do choose to become involved, you will find friends hereabouts who may aid you. But you must consider yourselves at best unofficial allies of those who fight evil. With that, Burne bids you good luck, and you are escorted out of the tower. ENCOUNTER DESCRIPTIONS There are a number of different encounters that the caravan could have on its journey. It should be noted that the three brigand groups do not cooperate with one another, despite the fact that they all are in the employ of the Temple; each is aligned with a different faction within the Temple, and thus are at best rivals. The factions use their brigand raiders to increase their own wealth and influence within the Temple itself. The DM is reminded that many of these encounters will remain in the area for some time, such as Jijohn, the Verbobonc patrol, and so forth. Such encounters might become long-term participants in the campaign, offering aid or interference as the situation warrants. Abbey Brigands A group of brigands from the group posted at the Abbey (see below) attacks the caravan. One brigand will be in plain sight in the cart-path, bidding the caravan to halt and demanding its surrender. The group will be led by Heavy Snej, and will consist of 8 other brigands (the rest remain behind in the Abbey; roll randomly to determine which brigands are present). The bandits will form a ring around the caravan before the trap is sprung, so that no one is able to escape. If allowed, the bandits will take all of the carts and their contents back to the Abbey, take all valuables from the members of the caravan, take any beautiful women back with them as slaves, and will bind the men, saying they will be left here for someone to untie later. This last is a lie; once the men have allowed themselves to be bound, they will be slain and the bodies burned. Brigand Victims The PCs come upon the remnants of an attack by brigands. The burned remains of two carts are here, along with two slain draft horses. Three bodies lie nearby, unburied but obviously looted. If a ranger is present, tracks will lead off towards whichever brigand group is closest (Abbey or Watchtower; those at the Moathouse leave no traces). If the Abbey or Watchtower is closest, there is also one dead brigand, who is quite obvious from his clothing and remaining gear. His fellow bandits stripped the body of anything useful before they left. Lareth would never allow such sloppiness, of course. Celenese Patrol This is a group of elves, outriders who are part of a larger patrol guarding the border region in the Kron Hills. They wear Celenese livery (a tree proper on a purpure field). They will not be particularly suspicious of a small caravan such as that which the PCs are guarding, especially if it is heading away from Celene. As long as the PCs are relatively friendly and not suspicious, the elves will reciprocate. Any intelligence told to the patrol concerning brigand activity will be welcome. Serjeant: 4th level fighter, HP 23, AC 3 (chainmail, shield, and 15 DEX), armed with short bow and long sword. She rides a light warhorse (HD 2, HP 9, AC 7, MV 24”, #AT 2, DAM 1-4/1-4). He has 11 g.p. on her person. Elf soldiers (5): HD 1+1, HP 5 each, AC 5 (chainmail), armed with short bow and long sword. Each rides a light warhorse (HD 2, HP 9, AC 7, MV 24”, #AT 2, DAM 1-4/1-4). Each carries 2-5 g.p. Gnarley Forest Animal/Monster Roll on the following table to determine the encounter: Die Roll (d6) Encounter 1 1 ogre (HD 4+1, HP 18, AC 5, #AT 1, DAM 1- 10) 2 2-5 atomies (HD 1/2, HP 2 each, AC 4, #AT 2, armed with small spears, SA attack as 3rd level fighter, spells, surprise) 3 1-3 giant fire beetles (HD 1+2, HP 6 each, AC 4, #AT 1, DAM 2-8) 4-5 1 wild boar (HD 3+3, HP 15, AC 7, #AT 1, DAM 3-12) 6-7 1-3 large spiders (HD 1+1, HP 5 each, AC 8, #AT 1, DAM 1-6, SA poison (save +2)) 8 1 poisonous snake (HD 2+1, HP 9, #AT 1, DAM 1, SA poison; +2 saving throw, causes sickness and incapacitation for 2-8 days)

6

Die Roll (d6) Encounter 9-10 2-7 deer (HD 2, HP 6 each, AC 8, #AT 1, DAM 1-3) and 1 stag (HD 3, HP 12, AC 7, #AT 1 or 2, DAM: 2-8 or 1-3/1-3) 11 2-5 wild dogs (HD 1+1, HP 5 each, AC 7, #AT 1, DAM 1-4) 12 1 owlbear (HD 5+2, HP 22, AC6, #AT 3, DAM 2- 8/2-8/2-5, SA surprise on a 1-5) Goblin Band A small group of goblins has come up from the Suss forest to try their hand at raiding in the Gnarley. They have not been particularly successful, but they haven’t been so wounded as to return to their home. They have a small camp a half-mile from where they attempt to ambush the caravan. Note that because of their lawful evil alignment, they are not welcome in the Temple. Their presence in the forest is mere coincidence. Goblins (7): HD 1-1, HP 3 each, AC 6, armed with spear and sling. Back at their camp the goblins have a sack with a total of 47 s.p., 6 g.p., and a small wooden duck, representing the totality of their ill-gotten goods to date. Hillmen The Kron Hills are home to many small clans of hillmen, who exist in the borderland and serve neither Celene nor Verbobonc or Veluna. Their lives are more primitive, but they are content, as they are beholden to no one but themselves. The PCs encounter a small group of hillmen, who will be inclined to be wary of outsiders: 7 hillmen (HD 1, HP 5 each, AC 7 (furs and leather), armed with spears. Jijohn the Tinker Jijohn (pronounced “jee-jahn”) is a figure known throughout the region, from Hommlet to the Wild Coast. The wizened gnome has been plying the paths and byways here for more than a hundred years, driving his little dog-cart, repairing odd bits of junk, selling odder bits of junk, and somehow always knowing everything that’s going on, even if he doesn’t always tell anyone else. When it comes to fulfilling the needs of the farmers, woodsmen, miners, and shepherds on his route, he always seems to have exactly what the customer needs. Indeed, some say his ability to do so is almost supernatural, although none have ever been able to fathom why or how. Jijohn: 6th/8th level gnome illusionist/thief, HP: 24, AC 4 (DEX, ring of protection +2), unarmed but can pluck a short sword +3 out of his cart if needed. He does not practice thievery, but is an accomplished tinker, able to repair common household items such as kettles, crockery, baskets, leather, etc. He has no spell book that can be found, but has the following spells memorized: First level: dancing lights, hypnotism, phantasmal force, spook Second level: invisibility, misdirection, whispering wind Third level: suggestion If his cart is searched, it will be found to be filled with junk. Broken tin cups, bits of wire, cracked crockery, buttons and bits of ribbon of every description, and so forth. But when he begins to rummage around the cart, after a minute or two he invariably comes up with exactly the (almost invariably non-magical and completely mundane) item that a customer needs. The cart is pulled by his faithful companion, Red (HD 1, HP 3, AC 7, #AT 1, DAM 1-3). Red looks to be as ancient as his master, nearly blind and fond of being petted. When Jijohn is threatened, however, a brown-coated wolf of great size miraculously appears to defend him (HD 2+2, HP 18, AC 7, #AT 1, DAM 2-5). Jijohn is a mysterious figure to be sure, and it can be taken as true that the statistics above do not accurately reflect the entirety of him. The DM is encouraged to play him up as a harmless and eccentric, but occasionally uncanny, figure. Kron Hills Animal/Monster Roll on the following table to determine the encounter: Die Roll Encounter 1 Giant fire beetles (1-3): HD 1+2, HP 6 each, AC 4, #AT 1, DAM 2-8 2 Leprechaun: HD 1-1, HP 5, AC 8, #AT 0, SA spell-like powers, snatch objects, never surprised 3 Wild cattle (2-8): HD 2, HP 8 each, AC 7, #AT 1, DAM 1-4, SA stampede + trample) plus 1 wild bull (HD 4, HP 16, AC 7, #AT 2, DAM 1-6/1-6 4-5 Giant sheep (2-4): HD 4, HP 16 each, AC 6, #AT 1, DAM 2-12 6-7 Poisonous snake: HD 2+1, HP 9, #AT 1, DAM 1, SA poison; -1 saving throw, causes sickness and incapacitation for 1-4 days 8 Giant centipedes (2-5): HD 1/4, HP 1 each, #AT 1, DAM 0, SA poison +4 on saving throw 9-10 Wild dogs (2-5): HD 1+1, HP 5 each, AC 7, #AT 1, DAM 1-4 11-12 Wild goats (1-4) plus 1 buck goat: HD 1+2, HP 6 each, AC 7, #AT 1, DAM 1-3, SA buck can charge; +2 to hit and 1-2 additional damage Mining Party A mixed group of dwarves and gnomes (led by one Redard Ironeye) are traveling to a new mine site they have begun. While they are still lawful good, they are very suspicious of any strangers, and nearly paranoid about others finding the site of their new mine, which they believe will make them all rich. They are marching, but also lead 4 mules carrying their tools and supplies. Redard Ironeye: 3rd level dwarf fighter, HP 17, AC 5 (chainmail), armed with a hammer. He carries a map to the mine site. Dwarves (3): HD 1, HP 4 each, AC 7 (studded leather), #AT 1, armed with short swords. Gnomes (3): HD 1, HP 3 each, AC 8 (leather), #AT 1, armed with spears and slings. Mules (3): HD 3, HP 11 each, AC 7, #AT 1 or 2, DAM 1-2 (bite), 1- 6 (kick). Moathouse Brigands A band of brigands from the Moathouse attacks the caravan. See “The Ruins of the Moathouse”, area 7 (in the adventures T1 THE VILLAGE OF HOMMLET, p. 13, or T1-4 THE TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL, p. 22), for details on the 7 brigands, their leader, and his

7

aide. They will be accompanied by 3 of the gnolls from area 29 of the same adventure (note the gnolls’ willingness to parley, as they are dissatisfied with the loot they have been receiving). Their master, Lareth the Beautiful, has trained these brigands well. They will attempt to ambush the caravan, and engage in solid tactics, flanking the caravan to prevent coherent defense or escape. If they are victorious, the brigands will not leave any traces; bodies will be loaded onto the carts and disposed of near the Moathouse, while the loot is divvied up (after a very generous cut has been removed for the Temple itself, of course). If the brigands are faced with stiff resistance (which hopefully the PCs will provide), the brigands will disengage. Bodies of fallen bandits will be taken if possible, even to the point of making a second raid in order to do so. If any of the regular bandits are captured, they can be persuaded to give up the location of their base, but they really know no details beyond that. The leader and his aide will not betray that they are based in the Moathouse. Pilgrims of St. Cuthbert A band of holy pilgrims bearing the holy symbol of St. Cuthbert, traveling east towards the Wild Coast after having visited the shrine to St. Cuthbert in the village of Hommlet in the Kron Hills. This encounter will occur in late afternoon, and they offer to share a camp with the caravan for the night. If the PCs agree, during the course of the evening, the pilgrims begin acting somewhat suspicious. The regular pilgrims are uncommunicative, almost sullen. The clerics are overly pleasant to the point of obsequiousness, but if watched carefully and subtly, they can be seen to be looking around past the campfire. The pilgrims are, in fact, just what they appear to be. However, they have been stalked by an erinyes for the past few days, who has been plaguing their sleep with nightmares, engaging in sudden hit-and-run attacks, and generally wearing down the group to the point where the erinyes is about to strike this night. The pilgrims are scared witless, and the clerics are trying to put a brave face on things as they prepare for the end. The presence of the PCs might change the outcome… Priest Bevensen: 3rd level cleric, HP 11, AC 7 (leather armor, DEX), armed with a mace. He carries a scroll of protection from water. He has the following spells memorized: 1st level: cure light wounds (x2), protection from evil, remove fear 2nd level: aid, chant Acolyte Meeve: 1st level cleric, HP 8, AC 8 (leather armor), armed with a mace. She has the following spells memorized: 1st level: cure light wounds, protection from evil Pilgrims (1): 0-level humans, HP 3 each, AC 10, 5 are armed with knives, 4 are unarmed. Erinyes: HD 6+6, HP 30, AC 2, #AT 1, DAM 2-8, SA cause fear in those who view her (save vs. wand applies), detect invisible, locate object, invisibility, polymorph self, produce flame at will. carries a rope of entanglement and a dagger with venom that causes unconsciousness for 1-6 rounds). If the PCs materially help the clerics in defeating the erinyes, the clerics will be very grateful, not only healing any injuries they might have suffered, but gifting them with the scroll that he carries. “It’s not much” he will say, “but it’s all I have.” Verbobonc Patrol The PCs encounter a large train of soldiers wearing the livery of Verbobonc. There are seven mounted officers leading a train of 40 or 50 miserable looking soldiers. They are obviously levies conscripted from among the lower classes who are lucky if they know which end of their spears to stick into an enemy. The PCs and the caravan will be treated brusquely. The patrol is here to discourage brigand activity, and the captain has no intention of wasting time interrogating every wine or cloth merchant who passes their way. The captain, one Renald Horgerston (F7), is singularly dislikeable. Pompous, unconcerned with the feelings or observations of others, he will ignore any pleas or appeals to logic. If he does not find the brigands, he’ll be damned if he’ll let someone else do the finding and capture the glory. At the very best, he will dispatch a squad of 6 levies (0-level fighters, HP 3 each, AC 7, armed with spears) led by a veteran corporal (F1, HP 7, AC 6, armed with a spear), but only under the most severe provocation (such as a PC threatening to tell “my 2nd cousin the Viscount” about his lack of action in the face of concrete information about the brigands’ location). Watchtower Brigands A raiding party consisting of 1d6+4 brigands from the Watchtower (determine randomly) will be led either by Erin Darkmoon (40% chance) or her lieutenant Garoff (60% chance) who will always have his trained monkey Willie with him. The brigands will ambush the caravan from both sides, divided as evenly as possible. They will not waste time with parleying. Erin will accept a surrender (who will be taken back to the Watchtower to be used as slaves and sacrifices at the Temple), but Garoff will not, preferring to kill everyone and burn what can’t be carted off. Wood Elves A group of sylvan elves on a hunting expedition. There is a 50% chance that they have already taken down a deer and two of them will be carrying it on a pole. They will be friendly to the PCs unless greeted rudely, and will be able to give information about local terrain and inhabitants. Wood elves (6): HD 1+1, HP 5 each, AC 6 (studded leather), #AT 1, armed with long bow and spear. Each has 1-6 g.p. Woodsmen The PCs encounter a group of woodsmen on a hunting/gathering expedition. They are not at all friendly and are distrustful of outsiders, but are downright hateful towards the brigands in the forest, who have raided woodsman villages and homes. This might be an opportunity to turn the woodsmen into allies. The woodsmen will set an ambush for the caravan, but only to determine that they are not associated with the brigands; they will not actually attack unless they themselves are attacked. Woodsmen (8): HD 1, HP 5 each, AC 6 (ring mail), armed with longbow and hand axe, SA: surprise 50% of the time.

Xvart Band These xvarts have come up from the Pomarj, and are en route to enlist in the forces of the Temple, making for the Watchtower. They are not actively looking to attack caravans, so any meetings with the PCs would be accidental. They carry 2-12 c.p. each and are generally quite wretched, as are most of their race. Xvarts (12): HD 1-1, HP 3 each, AC 7, #AT 1, armed with small swords (2-5 damage). THE ABBEY DM’S BACKGROUND The easternmost group of bandits has set up a base of operations in a ruined abbey, formerly dedicated to Allitur, god of ethics and propriety. It has no prior association with the Temple; it is telling that the newly resurgent Temple has operations beyond its original area of influence. The DM should remember that these bandits are part of the Water Temple faction and are loyal to Canon Belsornig. A ranger will be able to detect signs of traffic heading in and out of the main gate, and to a lesser extent the back door in Area 11. Through a break in the dense foliage, you see the crumbling walls of some large structure, perhaps 100’ by 150’. The walls are covered with vines and have obviously not been well kept-up. There is an open walled courtyard surrounded by low buildings, with one corner sporting a windowed second story. Several entrances present themselves, including a main gate and a large hole in the east wall. There is no obvious evidence of habitation; if there was ever a path leading to the main gate, it has long since turned into little more than a game trail. ENCOUNTER KEY 1. MAIN GATE. A pair of large oaken doors stands slightly ajar; leaving enough room for a person to walk through. Anyone approaching has a 50% chance of being spotted by the guard in Area #12. In the southwest corner of the courtyard are a number of empty casks, which are the empties that have been discarded from the great hall by the brigands. 2. COURTYARD. This area of the Abbey is open to the sky. It is overgrown with weeds and tall grasses, and several small trees have begun to take root. Those entering by the main gate or the large gap in the eastern wall have a 50% chance of being spotted by the guard in Area #12. 3. WELL. The well is partially tumbled down, but there is a recently-used bucket and rope that can be used to lower and raise it. 4. BATHS. Originally this building was a bath-house for the abbey’s inhabitants. There are three large tubs, all empty now, and a fire-pit where water was heated. Several large copper kettles are on the floor as well, and there is a wet spot on the floor some 4’ across. The bandits avoid this room as the wet spot is actually a gray ooze (12 h.p.). 5. STOREROOM. This narrow room is filled with looted foodstuffs; sacks of grain, vegetables both fresh and pickled, meat packed with salt in barrels, for transport, and so forth. Fortunately the brigands’ activities keep them well-supplied in terms of food. 6. CELLAR. This room is directly under the abbot’s quarters and is where the brigands have stored their more valuable loot. Three large, locked chests are here, as well as four rolled up tapestries (1,000 g.p. value each). Chest #1 holds 2,000 g.p. and four pieces of jewelry worth 250 g.p. each. Chest #2 is trapped; a bladder will spray acid on whomever opens the chest, inflicting 2d4 h.p. of damage. It holds 10,000 s.p. Chest #3 is a booby trap; it holds nothing except a slithering tracker (18 h.p.) which will randomly select one individual in the room when the chest is opened, and follow that individual until it can strike. 7. ABBOT’S QUARTERS. The door to this place will be barred if the bandit leader is present. Once the living quarters of the head of the abbey, this chamber is now occupied by the bandit leader. Heavy Snej is a half-orc 3rd level cleric/assassin-- S 15, I 10, W 12, D 14, C 15, Ch 13; 15 hit points; AC 3 (chainmail and shield +1); short sword and dagger +1. Snej holds the keys the treasure chests in Area #6. He is an effective leader if an uninspired one; his raids show none of the finesse of some of the other bandits. It is his raids that have alerted outsiders to the fact that there are bandits about, as his raiders will leave bodies and wrecked wagons in their wake. While he is loyal to the Water Temple, he is much more interested in raiding and killing than he is in Temple politics. The chamber is sparsely furnished, with a bed, table, and two chairs. A single small chest holds personal belongings (clothing, etc.), as well as a small pouch with 30 g.p. and five 50 g.p. gems. Snej’s spells are:

First Level: Command, Cure Light Wounds

Second Level: Hold person If Snej is slain, discrete inquiries will be made in Narwell, similar to those described in T1 THE VILLAGE OF HOMMLET if Lareth the Beautiful is slain. 8. CHAPEL. The doors to this place are half-open. What used to be the chapel of Allitur is now a ruined mess, and a small dragon appears to be imprisoned here. Any who hold that deity as a patron will feel a great rush of sadness and anger seeing the desecration that has been wrought here. The walls are covered with frescos depicting various myths and stories sacred to Allitur, but these have been defaced with graffiti and hacked at with sharp instruments. The statue of the deity has similarly been defaced (literally) as the nose has been broken off as well as one of the arms. Paint has been applied in rude places. The altar is untouched, however; it still gleams white and appears completely untouched. This is because of a repulsion enchantment upon the altar that compels all those of evil alignment to avoid the stone. The high vaulted ceiling is similarly untouched, but it seems like only the inconvenience of reaching it has thus spared it. A small, very young silver dragon is attached to the statue of Allitur by an iron chain attached to a ring on its neck. Airgid: 9 HD, 9 h.p., AC -1, speaks common and draconic, does not cast spells. Airgid will remain in dragon form most of the time, but will polymorph self into the form of a young child if she needs to

9

disguise herself. She was captured while journeying from the Lortmil Mountains, and is being held by Snej until he can figure out a way to transport the dragon to the Temple safely. If freed, Airgid will want to escape immediately, as she is frightened of the brigands as any child would be. She can be persuaded to aid the PCs by someone with a CHA of 15 or higher, but upon taking any damage she will immediately seek to fly away westward to the mountains. If returned safely to anywhere within 100 miles of the Lortmils, she will depart, and a chest with 500 p.p. will be delivered to the PCs within a few weeks from her parents, as a token of thanks. 9. KITCHEN. This place is a mess, but functional in a chaotic way. Two slaves (Mae, a teenager from Verbobonc, and Arin, a young widow from Narwell, both 0 level humans with 2 h.p. each) do all the cooking and serving, while Urot, a female orc (AC 9, 5 h.p.), oversees them with a short whip and any kitchen implement that is handy. Except in the middle of the night there is always some sort of activity here; at night the two girls are chained to a huge cauldron that is far too heavy for them to move easily. Urot has the key. Their families will pay 50 g.p. each for the girls’ safe recovery. 10. GREAT HALL. Unless alerted to danger, half of the remaining bandits from area #11 will be here, either eating, relaxing, gambling etc. If they are alerted to attackers, the bandits can assemble here, or use it as a redoubt if required (the outer door can be barred with a heavy oaken beam). There are several long tables with benches, and the place is dimly lit and filled with the smells of spilled beer and food. Along the west wall are several racks containing 20 weapons of various sorts and a total of 5 shields. In the southeast corner, there are many barrels of ale and wine. 11. LIVING QUARTERS. The main body of the bandit force is quartered in these former monks’ cells. It is very unlikely that the bandits will be caught here unawares, but if they are, the doors are unable to be locked, and sounds do not travel through the thick walls. The serjeant has his own chamber, two are in area #12 at any given time, and 6 will be in the great hall (area #10). Of course if the bandits are alerted to the presence of intruders, they will be disbursed across the abbey accordingly. The serjeant is a 2nd level fighter, all the rest are 1st level fighters. Number Armor Type Weapons Armor Class Hit Points Serjeant chainmail battle axe 4 13 2 leather & shield spear 7 3 3 leather flail 8 4 4 padded crossbow, dagger 8 5 5 padded & shield mace, hand axe 7 5 6 ring mail glaive 6 7 7 leather spear, short sword 8 8 8 leather & shield longsword 7 5 9 padded & shield mace, 3 javelins 7 4 10 padded crossbow, hand axe 8 6 11 padded club, 3 darts 8 7 12 leather flail 8 6 Note that as bandits are slain by the PCs (whether while out on a bandit raid or in forays into the Abbey), they should be stricken off the list. Replacements for slain bandits will not arrive before at least 6 days have gone by from the time they are requested. 12. GUEST ROOM. Originally a guest room in the heyday of the Abbey, this room is now used as a guard room. There are two tables, chairs, and one guard looking out the south and east window (behind the cover of rotting curtains) for anyone approaching the main gate or the gap in the wall. There is a 50% chance of those entering either way being spotted. Either bandit 4 or 10 will be here on duty. If they see anyone entering the compound, they will rush downstairs to alert the other bandits. 13. GUEST ROOM. The roof of this side of the tower is mostly collapsed, and the room itself is a wreck. It is home to a giant spider (20 h.p.) which has built a large web over the ruins. The brigands are aware of the creature an are sure to not disturb it. Under the webbing, there is a cloak of elvenkind crumpled into a ball. Setting fire to the webbing will, of course, destroy it unless it successfully makes a saving throw of 11 or higher. THE WATCHTOWER DM’S BACKGROUND In the heyday of the Temple, streams of humanoids would come up from the Pomarj through the Suss Forest to swell the ranks of evil. A watchtower was built on the border of the Suss and Gnarley forests, to give these recruits a point to aim for. From here, they were passed on to the Temple proper, or various other places where they would be of use. Since the downfall of the temple, the watchtower was abandoned. Ignored as too far out of the way and too unimportant for the forces of Good to deal with directly, its garrison fled back to the south, and the watchtower fell into disuse. Recently, however, it has seen new activity, as a new trickle of recruits has begun to come up from the south once again, to be sent northwards to swell the ranks of the newly resurgent Temple. It’s easy to find the tower; it seems as if it was deliberately made to be visible for miles around. It is approximately 50’ in height. As you approach, you can see the holes in the stonework, the vines and other vegetation climbing up the vertical surface, that bespeaks of a structure long abandoned to the elements. ENCOUNTER KEY 1. MAIN HALL. The door to this room, which takes up the entire ground floor of the tower, is made of bronzewood and is barred from the inside. Within, 1d4+4 brigands will be present at any given time, unless they are on a raid. The room contains several long tables with benches, and supplies taken from captured merchants line the walls with boxes and kegs of food and drink. A small smoky fire is in the center of the room. The state of readiness of the brigands is determined by how the room is approached and entered; if an attack is obviously in process, they might even be reinforced by all remaining brigands and leaders. The stairs to the basement are under the stairs to the second floor, and a large ring of keys is kept on a peg there, which can open the manacles of the captives held in the basement. 2. BARRACKS. This is where the human bandits are quartered. Those who are not on guard duty (1d4+4 from both barracks

10

in the main hall, 1 in the guard room, and 1 in the observation room) will be here or in Area #3, unless they are out on a raid. Number Armor Type Weapons Armor Class Hit Points 1 leather & shield spear, hand axe 7 5 2 padded longbow, dagger 8 4 3 padded & shield long sword, 3 darts 7 4 4 leather mace, dagger 8 5 5 leather Short sword, crossbow 8 4 6 studded leather crossbow, hand axe 7 3 3. BARRACKS. Those humanoids who are not sent on to the Temple are quartered here, and assist the bandits in their raids. Those who are not on guard duty (1d4+4 from both barracks in the main hall, 1 in the guard room, and 1 in the observation room) will be here or in Area #3, unless they are out on a raid. Number Race Weapons Armor Class Hit Points 7 gnoll halberd 5 8 8 xvart small sword 7 5 9 bugbear long bow, spear 5 6 10 bugbear morning star 5 13 11 gnoll battle axe 5 10 12 gnoll two-handed sword 5 9 13 xvart small sword, 3 darts 7 3 14 bugbear glaive 5 14 4. GUARD ROOM. Erin has brought with her a pair of animated skeletons (4, 5 h.p.), a gift from her patron in the lands of Iuz. They have orders to attack anyone entering the room who does not speak the password “Iuz”. The sounds of fighting in this room will alert the bandit leader in the adjacent room. 5. OUTER CHAMBER. This is the living quarters of Erin Darkmoon, a 3rd level assassin (S: 14, I: 13, W: 10, D: 17, C: 15, Ch: 14; 15 hit points, AC 5 (leather armor, DEX), armed with a short sword and 6 darts. She has four packets of dust of sneezing and choking and three vials of insinuative poison A (if save fails, causes 15 h.p. damage in 2-5 rounds), wears five pieces of jewelry worth 300 g.p. each (one of which is actually a magic item; see below), and carries a personal pouch with 50 g.p. and four gems worth 250 g.p. each. In addition to the rest of her jewelry, she also wears an amulet that allows her to telepathically communicate with High Priestess Halga, her superior in Dorakaa (and vice versa). Finally, she carries a key to Area #15. Erin is in the service of Iuz, and is also a member of the Assassins Guild of Dyvers. She loathes Lareth the Beautiful in the Moathouse, and the feeling is mutual. Erin feels her activities recruiting humanoids for the Temple, in addition to her banditry in the forest, make her more important than Lareth, but is constantly enraged by the praise he receives. Her raids are not as cleverly done as his, however, and her bandits will often leave traces of their work behind. She is quite paranoid, and will flee at the first sign that she is outmatched by a foe. Failing that, she will offer all her riches in return for her freedom. The chamber has a bed, wardrobe, and table and chairs. It is not particularly richly appointed, and the tapestries on the walls are cheap and threadbare, more for controlling drafts than enhancing the beauty of the room. 6. INNER CHAMBER. The door to this chamber can be barred, but is usually kept unbarred except when the leader is fleeing an attack. A crossbow is set so that it will automatically fire at anyone coming through the door; the poisoned quarrel will do an additional 10 points of damage if it hits. The trap must be enabled to function; it will be if the brigand leader is fleeing this way. Several of the stones on the southern wall will swing outward when a hidden lever is thrown, and a rope ladder will fall out of the hollow wall, enabling a quick escape for the bandit leader if needed. 7. ARMORY. This room is filled with weapons and armor of various types, stacked haphazardly on tables and the floor. There are 5 suits of leather armor, 4 suits of padded armor, 2 small shields, 12 spears, 6 assorted pole arms, 2 maces, 4 daggers, and a barrel of arrows (but no bow). These are given to new recruits, if needed. 8. LIEUTENANT’S QUARTERS. The second in command of this band of brigands, Garoff, is quartered here; he is a 2nd level fighter (S 17, I 8, W 8, D 13, C 16, Ch 10; 19 hit points, AC 7 (studded leather), armed with a flail +1 and spear. He carries a key to Area #15. He is secretly working for the Fire Temple and has convinced a third of the bandits to join his position. Once he feels secure enough, he plans to slay Erin and assume command of the Watchtower in the name of the Fire Temple. He is not nearly as clever as he thinks he is, however, and Erin is completely aware of his true loyalty and his plans. Garoff is never without his trusted companion Willie, a trained monkey who also has the some thief abilities as if he were a 10th level thief (HD 1-1, 3 hit points, AC 3, #AT 1, DAM 1, PP 80%, MS 78%, HS 63%, CW 99%). Willie can understand most simple commands, but will only obey Garoff. 9. STOREROOM. This room contains several bags, boxes, and casks of mundane items such as oil, torches, blankets, etc. Food is kept in the main hall, while valuables are in the secret room in the cellar. 10. GUARD ROOM. In the heyday of the Temple, when the Watchtower was fully staffed, several guards would be stationed here to defend the tower if attacked. Currently it is empty, but four crossbows and a total of 40 bolts are kept here. The room can be manned by brigands from the barracks if needed. 11. OBSERVATION ROOM. A guard from the barracks will be here, looking for approaching bands of humanoids seeking to join the temple. If he sees such a band, he will alert the brigands in the main hall and go to the roof. 12. ROOF. If the guard in the observation room sees a large group of humanoids approaching, he will move to here after alerting the brigands in the main hall. Once he has verified their intentions, he will signal that it is safe to open the door to the tower. 13. BASEMENT. This dank chamber has a dirt floor and several rings on the walls, to which are chained several captives from previous raids. Several unused sets of manacles dangle from empty rings, where additional captives can be held. There are currently three captives present. Iridia is a high elf from Celene, a 4th level magic-user (11 hit points, no spells remaining) and lady-in-waiting in the court of a minor noble, and will give a wand of secret door and trap detection to

11

anyone who sees her safely home.. Dorof (0 level human, 3 hit points) is a drover from Narwell. Welmon Urlin is a merchant from Veluna (0 level human, 4 hit points) who will pay 200 g.p. to those who see him safely home. Those who can reward their liberators cannot obviously do so immediately. They do know of the existence of the secret door and will readily tell the PCs, but they do not know the mechanism used to open it. 14. SECRET ROOM. This room is filled with various looted items taken from merchants and caravans. There are 8 large rugs worth 50 g.p. each, a dozen beaver pelts worth 2 g.p. each, 10 tanned leather hides worth 5 g.p. each, six kegs of nails worth 20 g.p. each, ten sacks of salt worth 1 g.p. each, ten bolts of cloth worth 12 g.p. each, four pints of blue dye worth 5 g.p. each, and six bolts of linen worth 18 g.p. each. To the south is a door, stoutly barred from this side, which leads to a tunnel. The tunnel emerges in the forest about a quarter-mile from the Watchtower, at a cave whose entrance is largely obscured by vegetation. Near the mouth of the cave is a concealed backpack containing clothing, a pouch containing 50 g.p. and ten 100 g.p. jewels, a dagger +1, a potion of extra healing and a potion of invisibility. 15. INNER SECRET ROOM. This is where the main loot of the brigand band is stored. The door to this room is locked, and only Erin and Garoff have keys. It contains four large chests, none of which is locked. Chest #1 contains 6,000 s.p., 1,300 e.p., and 20 p.p. Chest #2 contains 500 g.p., an illuminated manuscript worth 200 g.p., and a fox cape worth 300 g.p. Chest #3 is a trap; anyone opening it will release a cloud of sleeping gas; anyone within 10’ of the chest must make a saving throw vs. poison or fall asleep (as per the spell) for 2-5 rounds. Chest #4 contains 2,000 s.p., 1,000 g.p., a ceremonial shield bearing the arms of Veluna worth 400 g.p., a small alabaster statue of some dwarf (it’s actually a statue of Clanggedin Silverbeard, the dwarven god of war) worth 1,000 g.p., and a harp worth 75 g.p. OTHER ENCOUNTER AREAS Canryell This location within the Gnarley Forest is not part of the regular encounter tables for this adventure. However, It is only a few miles from the Abbey, and if the PCs happen to venture there in their adventures, the DM is encouraged to refer to the FROM THE ASHES CAMPAIGN BOOK, page 48, and THE ADVENTURE BEGINS ADVENTURE MAPS BOOK, pages 3-4 and 11. Oakvein This location within the Gnarley Forest is not part of the regular encounter tables for this adventure. However, It is only a few miles from the Watchtower, and if the PCs happen to venture there in their adventures, the DM is encouraged to refer to the FROM THE ASHES CAMPAIGN BOOK, pages 46-47. The Loremasters of the Wood-Elf Clan Enlanefel are aware of the presence of the bandits in the Watchtower, and even their connection to the Temple, but do not see either as a threat worthy of their attention. It should be remembered that non-elves will almost never find Oakvein, and even wood elves will not go there unless they have a very specific, and pressing, reason to do so.

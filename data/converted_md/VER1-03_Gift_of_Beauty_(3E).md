Gift of Beauty

Page 2 This is a RPGA Network adventure game. A four-hour time block has been allocated for playing the game (or this round of the game), but the actual playing time will be about three hours.

It is a good idea to ask each player to put a name tag in front of him or her. The tag should have the player's name at the bottom, and the character's name, race, and gender at the top. This makes it easier for the players to keep track of who is playing which character.

Scoring the game for RPGA points Scoring the game for RPGA points Scoring the game for RPGA points Scoring the game for RPGA points: The RPGA has three ways to score this game. Consult your convention coordinator to determine which method to use: 1. No-vote scoring: The players write their names and numbers on the scoring packet grid, you fill in the top of the grid. That is all. No one is rated. This method is used for people who are just playing for fun. 2. Partial scoring: The players rate the game master and the scenario on their player voting sheet, and provide personal information, but don’t vote for other players. The game master rates the scenario and completes personal and event information, but does not rate the players as a team or vote for players. This method is used when there is no competition, but the convention coordinator wants information as to how the game masters are performing, or the game master wants feedback on his or her own performance. 3. Voting: Players and game masters complete the entire packet, including voting for best player. If this method is used, be sure to allow about 15-20 minutes for the players to briefly describe their characters to the other players, and about 5-10 minutes for voting. This method is used when the players want to know who played the best amongst them, or when the adventure is run in tournament format with winners and prizes. Multi-round adventures usually required advancing a smaller number of players than played the first round, so voting is required for multi-round adventures.

When using Voting, rank the players in order of your voting choice while they are completing their forms, so that you are not influenced by their comments on your abilities.

The players are free to use the game rules to learn about equipment and weapons their characters are carrying.

Some of the text in this scenario is written so that you may present it as written to the players, while other text is for your eyes only. Text for the players will be in bold italics bold italics bold italics bold italics. It is strongly recommended that you paraphrase the player text, instead of reading it aloud, as some of the text is general and must be adapted to the specific situation or to actions of the player characters.

LIVING IVING IVING IVING GREYHAWK REYHAWK REYHAWK REYHAWK Tier Tier Tier Tier Structure Structure Structure Structure To determine the tier, add the character levels of all the characters. In addition, add the levels of any henchmen or animals according to the values on their certificates. Compare the total to the chart below to find the tier.

4 players 5 players 6 players 7 players Lvl Cap T1: 4-12 5-13 6-14 7-15 4nd T2: 13-22 14-24 15-26 16-28 6th T3: 23-32 25-35 27-38 29-41 8th

The level cap indicated the highest level of character allowed to play this adventure. Characters of levels higher than the highest level shown for the highest tier cannot be played.

Lifestyle Lifestyle Lifestyle Lifestyle At the beginning of every scenario, each PC is required to pay upkeep costs matching the level of lifestyle they wish to maintain. The cost of each lifestyle will be indicated at the beginning of the scenario scenario scenario scenario. The lifestyles, and the effects that each has on play, are:

Destitute Destitute Destitute Destitute You have no living space, and must carry all your gear everywhere. You eat poor quality food. You wear a peasant outfit, your only change of clothes. Poor Poor Poor Poor You sleep in poor accommodations, and eat poor quality food. You wear a peasant outfit, and have two sets of clothing. Common Common Common Common You have common lodgings, and eat common quality food. You have normal clothing for your profession (adventuring); nothing fancy. You probably have two or three sets of clothing. High High High High You stay in good quality lodgings, and eat good quality food. You wear anything in value up to courtier’s outfits, and generally buy a new set of clothing every two weeks. Luxury Luxury Luxury Luxury You have luxurious accommodations (twice the cost of good accommodations), and you eat excellent foods. You can throw a banquet for your friends every day, and frequently do. You wear clothing up to the value of noble’s outfit, and buy a new set of clothes every week.

Lifestyles come with bonuses or penalties to Diplomacy, Intimidate, Disguise, and Bluff skill checks. These penalties, shown below, should be applied at the DM’s discretion, and can sometimes backfire—for example, a PC with a poor lifestyle would not have a penalty when talking to a beggar, but would when talking to a city official. A PC with a high lifestyle should have a penalty when dealing with a group of street thugs, where a PC with a destitute lifestyle might not.

DMs are encouraged to role-play these reactions whenever possible.

Adventure Summary and Adventure Summary and Adventure Summary and Adventure Summary and Background Background Background Background At the Winter Solstice Festival His Lordship Viscount Langard request the common folk of Verbobonc create a work of craftsmanship to present to Her Fey Majesty of Celene, which lies to the South of Verbobonc, as a Gift. The folk of Verbobonc are renowned for their beautiful crafts and many of the craft guilds became excited. Tasking their memberships with the duty of creating such an item, the entire Viscounty set to work with the greatest of skill and dedication. Nearly a full Season had passed and the month of Readying approached. It was the Viscount's desire to present the Verbobonc Gift of Beauty on the High Day of Readying.

The Weaver Guild presented a beautiful tapestry depicting the cooperation of the elves, gnomes and man in the early building of Verbobonc City. The Silversmiths created a chalice of intricate etching of the forest animals beneath the Elven Oak Father of the Gnarley. Many an independent craftsman submitted their works and a single carving of wood stood above all the crafts presented. Carved from a single piece of delicate Ip Wood taken from a lightning sundered tree, is a box measuring slightly over 2 feet by 1 foot by 1 foot deep. The carvings took the form of the elven father Corliathian as he sat in a glad with animals and fey folk alike. The sides told the stories of may major events in elven history.

This working of wood won supreme and was taken to the Archdruid of the Western Gnarley for his blessings. Once so blessed all the crafts were displayed in the court of Greyfist for nearly a ten-day. After, the gift was taken to the Estate of Lord Deleveu a Southern Noble. Guarded by a patrol of Borderers, the 'Gift of Beauty' was transported to the borders of Celene where it was to be escorted to the Seat of Her Fey Majesty by a patrol of Elven Knights.

On the 10-mile journey from Lord Deleveu's estate to the border, the guardians of the gift were ambushed and all but one was slain. The surviving Borderer, Corporal Janic, was discovered by one of Lord Deleveu's tenant farmers. The Borderers were notified and word was brought back to His Lordship Langard yesterday. Wanting to keep this as low profile as possible he immediately moved to have a group of worthy and trusted adventures to locate and recover the gift. The use of Borderers has been overruled due to the possible need of entering lands that are not Verbobonc. A small force of not more than seven would work best in this situation.

If the adventures are able to recover the gift, they will need to successfully return the gift to the Estate of Lord Deleveu. It is here that the Patrol of Elven Guardians will take charge of the gift and return to Celene. Members of the recovery team are not sanctioned by the state and have no position within the service of the government. These individuals are merely assisting for whatever reasons they deem fit. Lord Deleveu will recognize the situation and need for silence.

Adventure Synopsis Adventure Synopsis Adventure Synopsis Adventure Synopsis Wyn will approach one of the PCs with a recommendation for adventure and a chance to make a name for themselves. There is a Noble to the South that has a bit of a lead on the 'missing gift.' He gives the adventurer a wooden coin etched with the image of the oak father on one side. He tells of the half-elf Noble named Deleveu that would be able to point them in a fortunate direction to have their names raised in status with the folk of Verbobonc. Many rewards in life are gained merely by action.

As the PCs travel south they encounter a mounted patrol of Lord Milinous's House. If the disclose what they are doing, it may reflect badly on the Viscount and cause political gossip.

Upon arriving at Deleveu Woods, Lord Deleveu will greet them with suspicion until they present the wooden coin. Once shown the coin, Lord Deleveu will escort them into his Manor and brief them in a well-organized military manner that belays the laid-back appearance and attitude first encountered. Afterward, they will be shown to quarters to be cleaned up and eat. After their meal, they will be shown to Corporal Janic and may ask questions.

Following Corporal Janic's instructions and the map provided by Lord Deleveu, the PCs will arrive at the ambush site early the next morning. All signs are four days old. Information will lead the PCs to the West into the Kron Hills and eventually into the Lortmils Mountains on the Celene border.

The trail will lead the PCs past a small ranch that is being worked by a small boy and his elven mother. The boy's father, Arnock, was taken earlier this week by a group of humans and half-orcs. They went deeper into the Lortmils.

The PCs comes to a fork in the trail. One fork travels back to the Northeast and the other travels west. Arnock left a sign for those that know the land. If the PCs travel West, they find the trail cold and dead some 2 miles up just as they get ambushed by Grimlocks. Traveling Northeast, the PCs come to a makeshift wilderness camp. Here they find the original ambush PCs and free Arnock and a Borderer Scout that remained alive from the ambush.

Arnock tells the PCs of a Gnome that was wearing a black symbol of some type of a bird. The gnome took the box and traveled Northeast. Arnock knows this part of the Lortmils and fears for his wife and son.

Following Arnick's directions, the PCs can catch up to the gnome and recover the gift. The gnome will escape. After this battle, the PCs can return to Deleveu Woods and await the arrival of the Celene Knights.

Accompany the Celene Knights to the Borderer and receive a Gift from Her Fey Majesty for their valiant efforts in the rescue of Arnock, citizen of Celene.

Returning to Deleveu Woods, Lord Deleveu presents each of the PCs with a wooden coin with the Oak Father on one side.

Encounter Ten Encounter Ten Encounter Ten Encounter Ten The Return The Return The Return The Return The return to Deleveu Woods is uneventful. The Borderer Scout is with you as he greets Lord Deleveu and presents the ‘package’. Lord Deleveu leads the PCs with ‘package’ in hand into the woods. Walking to one of the larger trees with a building just to the side and part of the tree. Lord Deleveu stops before an elven sentry in full plate. The armor is etched with symbols of the woodland and wears the amulet of the Knights of the Royal Court. Handing the package to the Knight, Lord Deleveu and the Knight speak in hushed tones. Lord Deleveu turns to the PCs and offers his thanks on behalf of both nations. Also, it has been brought to Lord Deleveu’s attention that you assisted in the release of Arnock, a citizen of Celene. It is the desire of the Knights of Celene that you be granted a reward. Leading the PCs back to the Manor House, Lorde Deleveu takes them inside to a grand feast in their honor. At the end of the meal, Lord Deleveu will present to each adventure, a wooden coin similar to the one that was used by the ranger who requested your assistance. The difference is that this coin has the Oak Father on a side dyed in green, and on the other side is the elvin ruin for friend.

Treasure Summary Treasure Summary Treasure Summary Treasure Summary Player characters may keep items from the scenario that are listed on the treasure list below or which meet the following conditions:

1. The item must be non-magical and specifically listed in the text of the adventure (e.g armor on foes). If it is not listed in the text, the characters cannot keep it. Items of this nature can be sold for 50% of book value, or recorded on a log sheet. 2. Animals, followers, monsters, henchmen, and so forth (any living being, basically) may not be kept from a scenario for any reason unless the treasure summary lists the being specifically. It is okay for the player characters to form relationships with NPCs, but these will not be certed and cannot bring material benefit to the character. Contacts (sources of extra information) must be specifically certed. 3. Theft is against the law, but may be practiced by some player characters. Items which are worth more than 200 gp that are of personal significance to the owner (including family heirlooms), and all magical items, will be discovered in the possession of the character by one means or another. The character must return the item and pay a fine equal to three times the value of the item stolen. In addition, the PC caught receives campaign-decided penalties for being known as a thief, such as Infamy. For other stolen items which meet the criteria in #1 above, use your judgment and the circumstances within the game to determine whether a PC thief gets away with the theft or not.

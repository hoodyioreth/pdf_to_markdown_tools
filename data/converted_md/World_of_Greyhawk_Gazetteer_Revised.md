Appendix g: Based on work by Paul Looby. 5 Foreword Foreword T he World of Greyhawk is yours, now - yours to do with as you wish.” -Allen Hammack So said Allen Hammack in the Foreword to the World of Greyhawk Gazetteer released in 1980. It is also credited to Gary Gygax in the years that followed. Greyhawk was one of the first campaign settings in which the game of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) was developed in the 1970s by the first Dungeon Masters (DMs). Dave Arneson’s Blackmoor and then Rob Kuntz’s Kalibruhn also saw the first player characters (PCs) exploring dungeons and fighting dragons. Gygax expected new DMs to want to develop their own campaign worlds (“homebrew” them), and was apparently surprised when stories of his own “Greyhawk” campaign in Dragon magazine resulted in DMs wanting details. Those calls resulted in the release of the World of Greyhawk Gazetteer by TSR in 1980 - what is now referred to by Greyhawk fans as “the Folio”, arising from its appearance as a 32-page soft cover folio book. The book provided the bare bones of the world, hinted at more, provided story “hooks”, and let the DMs do the rest. It also included the iconic “Darlene” map that fired many DMs’ imaginations for adventures in Greyhawk In the years that followed more Greyhawk material was published, much written by some of the great names of D&D. Support for Greyhawk by TSR and then Wizards of the Coast (WotC) waxed and waned over the years. At times Greyhawk was not supported as a setting, and continued on with the fans in periodicals such as the Oerth Journal (which continues today). Those fans included luminaries of the D&D world such as Gygax himself, Erik Mona, Len Lakofka, etc. Greyhawk has always held a special place in the hearts of many D&D fans. With the release of the Dungeon Master’s Guide 2024 (DMG 2024) Greyhawk has returned again as an example of worldbuilding for DMs to use, in Chapter 5: Creating Campaigns. The introduction to the chapter indicates that the version of Greyhawk presented is “largely” based on the Folio. This is correct - what is detailed in the DMG 2024 differs in various ways from the version of Greyhawk presented in published sources from 1980 until 2007 (see below for a synopsis of the various “eras” of Greyhawk) - some differences are cosmetic and others more radical. See Appendix A of this book for a list of the apparent differences. The DMG 2024 presents essentially an (slightly) alternative version of Greyhawk in the year 576 CY of the setting (see Chapter 1) to that presented in the various published sources from 1980 to 2007. However, this is part of the attraction of Greyhawk, a feature not a flaw - every DM can and has in their own way made it their own. There is no “right way” or “wrong way” to “do” Greyhawk - there is your way. As long as the DM and the players are having fun, Greyhawk is fulfilling its role as the setting for the story of that campaign. This Revised World of Greyhawk Gazetteer is intended to be read by new DMs using the DMG 2024, to introduce them to the wider world of Greyhawk and the material available to use from over 40 years of published material (and also fan produced material, with some of these fans being those who wrote the published material - often referred to as “apocryphal” as a result). This Gazetteer has sought to add detail to what was provided in the DMG 2024, having regard to what was contained in the 1983 “Gold Box” set and the 2000 Living Greyhawk Gazetteer, as well as the wider “lore” from over 40 years of Greyhawk published sources. DMs can take what they want, and leave what they don’t like. Think of it as a buffet where you can load up your plate for the feast for your PCs (or to feast on your PCs …). You might want to run with the DMG 2024 version and sprinkle it with some tasty treats from what you find here, or you might find the previous material is more to your taste and harvest it for material and ideas - the aim is to provide you with a start and the options. Then have fun. However, as a result this Gazetteer does include various details that will differ from those found in the DMG 2024. We have tried to identify them to a degree, to assist (including in Appendix A). But the aim here is to introduce DMs to the treasure trove of decades of Greyhawk material that is available to use (much of it easily available online via DriveThruRPG or Dungeon Master’s Guild). We have also attempted to identify in very brief terms some of the material available from the vibrant Greyhawk fan community, which has been producing material for years and is available online via various sources. Those writers include authors who have previously written for D&D and Greyhawk, and kept producing for the love of the setting, as well as a wealth of imaginative and creative writers who simply love the setting. As the CanonFire Greyhawk fan website says: “Editions change, Greyhawk endures” It endures because of the love of the fans for one of DnD’s most vibrant and revered settings. Step through the door and you never know where the road might lead you … (confession: I stole that line from the Greycast podcast, details of which can be found in Appendix H). 6 Introduction Introduction O erik is the major continent on the world of Oerth, and the eastern portion is known as the Flanaess. Little is known there about the other continents and their inhabitants. The Flanaess is a region dominated by humans. It has significant populations of elves, dwarves, gnomes and halflings scattered throughout it, but few independent realms of any of those species. Various tribes of other nonhuman species are also scattered throughout the region usually living on the wild fringes, but are not usually seen nor welcomed in the settled realms. The peoples of the Flanaess worship various deities, some common but others organized in ethnic or species- based pantheons. The deities of Oerth are relatively non- interventionist and do not usually involve themselves in the affairs of Oerth directly. However, deities often meddle through the actions of their priests and agents. Further, the Flanaess features various demi-gods and hero-deities or quasi-deities (mortals whose powers approach those of deities, often sponsored by a deity) who involve themselves in mortal affairs. Oerth is a world rich in magic. While the common people see little of the benefits of such directly, mages and clerics wield mighty powers, and their use can affect the fates of kingdoms. Many powerful and ancient artifacts lie buried in ruins throughout the Flanaess. Many of the most famous wizards and spells have come from the Flanaess, and are known throughout the multiverse. The story of the Flanaess is one of wars, migrations and history. There is constant competition for land, resources and on matters of principle. The various peoples have moved about, changing the Flanaess as a result - pushing others out or intermixing and creating new peoples. Every part of the Flanaess has a past and a story - the events of the past create the myths and legends, or ruins and artifacts, of today. The Eras of Greyhawk Published Greyhawk sources can be categorised into four “eras” as follows (also noting Appendix G to this book providing a detailed listing of published material): •	The “Classic” era of the Folio and Gold Box, along with the classic first edition D&D modules like Temple of Elemental Evil, Against the Slave Lords, Against the Giants, White Plume Mountain etc. This is in the years of 576-581 CY in the Flanaess. •	The “Wars” era of the Wars and From the Ashes books, along with the Carl Sargent sourcebooks, when the Flanaess are wracked by war and then deal with their immediate aftermath. This is in the years of 582-586 CY in the Flanaess. •	The “Post Wars” era of the Greyhawk Adventures and The Adventure Begins books, which advanced the timeline to 591 CY where the Flanaess was recovering from the wars and also moving closer in tone back to the “Classic” era. •	The “Living Greyhawk” era, which saw a “living” and shared campaign run by the then RPGA in what was essentially a precursor to the later Adventurers’ League, and was run, DMed and played by people internationally. The Living Greyhawk Gazetteer was written for this, and provides the most comprehensive picture of Greyhawk ever produced, set at the end of 591 CY. The campaign itself covered the years 591-598 CY in game, but much of the material is no longer or not easily available, and most was not official in any event. In addition to the above there is arguably a fifth era, being the limited Greyhawk material published during fifth edition D&D (since 2014), such as Ghosts of Saltmarsh and the conversion of various Classic era modules in books like Tales of the Yawning Portal, Tomb of Horrors and Quests from the Infinite Staircase. These adventures were essentially set in the Classic era of about 576 CY. The Greyhawk of the DMG 2024 would not appear to be part of any of these eras, as the changes in details amount to it being an alternative or parallel version set in 576 CY that stands apart (see Appendix A). Adventures and ideas can be used interchangeably, as desired by the DM with varying amounts of work involved. Spelljammer See Chapter 7 of this Gazetteer for brief details on Greyspace, the planetary system Oerth sits within for the purposes of Spelljammer campaigns, as well as suggested further reading. 7 Chapter 1: Chapter 1: History of the Flanaess History of the Flanaess Calendar NOTE: The calendar provided in the DMG 2024 is based on that contained in the Folio. That was later changed in the Gold Box to a 364-day calendar due to issues with the lunar cycles arising from the 360-day year. As such, this Gazetteer has (re)adopted the 364- day year from the Gold Box. The sun (Liga) travels around Oerth taking 364 days, passing through the 12 Lairs of the Zodiac. Luna, the Great Moon, has a cycle of 28 days which form the basis of the months. Celene, the aquamarine lesser moon known as the Handmaiden, has 4 cycles a year at the the time of the seasonal festivals. The Mistress and Handmaiden are both full at the same time only once a year (on the 4th day of the Richfest festival), which is always a time of great portent, depending on the positions of the five wandering stars in the Lairs. The seven Flan days of the week have been adopted and are standard across human cultures in the Flanaess as follows: 8 •	Starday - Work •	Sunday - Work •	Moonday - Work •	Godsday - Worship •	Waterday - Work •	Earthday - Work •	Freeday - Rest Each month is 28 days, and each festival is 7 days, long. The Dozenmonths and the four Festivals are: The most common measure of the years is that of the Common Year (CY), which commenced when universal peace throughout the Great Kingdom was declared by the Overking 576 years ago (noting there is no Common Year Zero - the first year was 1 CY). Five other calendars have been used by various cultures in the Flanaess, and are referred to in historical documents. Some realms and the elves still use these: Suloise Dating (SD), originally used by the now destroyed Suel Imperium and by Suel refugees that fled into the Flanaess. Olven Calendar (OC), still used by the elves of the Flanaess (and Oerth). Bakluni Hegira (BH), used by the Baklunish Empire and still in use in the various successor states of the Baklunish Basin. Flan Tracking (FT), previously used by the Flan tribes of the Flanaess but no longer in use. Oerid Record (OR), previously used by the Oeridian tribes some of which formed the Great Kingdom and Keoland. Historical Overview The general history of the Flanaess known to most inhabitants of civilised realms with even the most basic education is as follows. Over one thousand years ago, two ancient empires in the west—the Suel and the Baklunish—were locked in a great war, the origins of which are lost to time. Its consequences are still evident to this day. Following sixty-three years of deadlocked conflict, the Suloise unleashed the Invoked Devastation upon the Baklunish, wiping out nearly every trace of civilization north of the Sulhaut Mountains. In retaliation, Baklunish mage-priests unleashed the Rain of Colorless Fire upon the Suel, reducing their empire to ash. The Dry Steppes and the desolate Sea of Dust remain as monuments of these Twin Cataclysms. Even before the Cataclysms, the war had driven entire peoples eastward into the wide lands beyond the Barrier Peaks and Crystalmist Mountains. The tribal Oeridians, guided by prophecies of greatness, were the first to enter the lands of the Flanaess and encounter the Flan peoples who had dwelt there since time immemorial. Suloise refugees followed, sometimes allying with the Oerids and Flan, but more often warring with them to gain land and power. For over two centuries the Suel and Oeridians fought, with the Suel frequently defeated and pushed to the periphery while the Oeridians claimed the richest lands of the Flanaess. In the shattered west Baklunish survivors migrated north and west to the shores of the Dramidj Ocean, where they founded the realms of Ekbir and Zeif. In the Flanaess too, realms arose from the chaos of the Great Migrations. Among the first of these was the Kingdom of Keoland, founded nearly eighty years after the Twin Cataclysms. Suel noble houses allied with Oeridian tribes, pledging mutual protection and shared dominion over the lands along the great Sheldomar River. In the east, the Oeridian tribe known as the Aerdi conquered lands along the shores of the Solnor Ocean, founding the Kingdom of Aerdy. Over the next two centuries Aerdy came to dominate the eastern Flanaess, burgeoning into an empire known as the Great Kingdom. The first of its rulers adopted the title of the Overking of Aerdy, declared a new era of Universal Peace, and the first year of a new calendar of Common Years. The Great Kingdom’s dominion expanded as far as Veluna and Perrenland, and included an unremarkable trading outpost known as Greyhawk on the Selintan River. As the Overkings grew increasingly decadent and ineffectual, their empire slowly crumbled as, one by one, its far-flung provinces asserted their independence. In 254 CY the western Viceroyalty of Ferrond broke away, fragmenting into the realms of Furyondy, Veluna, and Perrenland amongst others. In 356 CY the excesses of the Overkings of the Celestial House of Rax drove the Viceroy of Nyrond to renounce his oaths to his imperial cousin, and crown himself as King of Nyrond. The assassination of Overking Nallif in 437 CY sparked a bloody civil war known as the Turmoil Between Crowns. A decade of internecine conflict ended with the malevolent Ivid I of the Celestial House of Naelax atop the Malachite Throne of Aerdy. This prompted the few remaining good-aligned fiefs to secede. In the west, Sultan Melek II of Zeif found the southern frontiers of his realm perennially plagued by raids by the nomads of the Plains of the Paynims. He thought to fight fire with fire, and thus, in about 290 CY, he invited the Brazen Horde, a federation of nomad clans from the distant land of Komal, to settle the Plains and subjugate the native tribes. However, fire is a treacherous servant, and the inferno soon spread to his dominions. In 316 CY, a confederation of displaced Bakluni and Oerid tribes calling themselves the Relentless Horde pillaged their way across Ekbir before Common Elves Nomads Season Needfest Fireseek Diamondice Tiger Winter Readying Yellowillow Bear Spring Coldeven Snowflowers Lion Spring Growfest Planting Blossoms Frog Low Summer Flocktime Violets Turtle Low Summer Wealsun Berrytime Fox Low Summer Richfest Reaping Goldfields Snake High Summer Goodmonth Sunflowers Boar High Summer Harvester Fruitfall Squirrel High Summer Brewfest Patchwall Brightleaf Hare Autumn Ready’reat Tinklingice Hawk Autumn Sunsebb Lacysnows Wolf Winter 9 claiming the cold steppes north of the Yatil Mountains as their new homeland. Though they later fragmented into the Chakyik and the Weigwur, the nomads dominate the north to the present day. The Brazen Horde overran the Zeifi provinces of Tusmit and Ket, which fell forever from the grasp of the sultan. For the next half-century, the nomads raided east into Bissel, Veluna, and Gran March until their depredations eventually stirred Keoland from its long slumber. Under a line of kings of the House of Rhola, Keoland embarked on a series of imperial conquests. At its greatest extent, the dominion of the King of Keoland reached from the Pomarj to Ket and as far north as Veluna’s southern provinces. However, a humiliating retreat from Ket, defeat by Furyondy in the Short War, and a rebellion by the lords of Ulek and the elves of Celene saw Keoland’s imperial ambitions come to naught. The accession of King Tavish IV in 453 CY heralded a shift in the kingdom’s policy to its vassal states: Geoff, the Yeomanry, and the Uleks were granted autonomy, while the Gran March and Sterich became semi-independent, though still bound by oaths to the Keoish crown. Amidst the northern reaches of the Flanaess, a new evil began to stir. The dark union of the witch-queen Iggwilv and the demon Graz’zt begat a cambion named Iuz, who rose to power in 479 CY as the lord of a small domain in the Howling Hills. With astonishing speed, he amassed an army of malevolent beings, wicked wizards, savage orcs, and dark demons, conquered a large realm for himself north of Whyestil Lake, and somehow attained demi-godhood. Yet in 505 CY, Iuz was imprisoned within the Godtrap, an eldritch device crafted within Castle Greyhawk by the enigmatic archmage Zagig Yragerne, as part of a scheme to secure his own apotheosis. New evils arose in Iuz’s absence. The Horned Society - a shadowy cabal of devil-worshipers - claimed some of the demi-god’s former lands. Meanwhile, on the marches of the Viscounty of Verbobonc, the cult of Elemental Evil - catspaws for Iuz’s consort, Zuggtmoy, Demon-Queen of Fungi - amassed a horde and built a stronghold known as the Temple of Elemental Evil. The cult was defeated at the Battle of Emridy Meadows in 569 CY by the Righteous Host, led by Crown Prince Thrommel of Furyondy, resulting in the Temple’s swift downfall. Four years later, Thrommel—a paladin of Rao—became engaged to Lady Jolene, a priestess of his faith and daughter of the Plar of Veluna. This marriage would have unified the two realms into a mighty bastion against the evil plaguing Eastern Oerik. However, Thrommel’s recent disappearance has thwarted these plans.

This is based on the previously published sources, not the DMG 2024. Note that the current edition of D&D has rules for playing various species, many of which are not referred to or detailed in previous Greyhawk material. Greyhawk was created and developed with earlier editions of D&D when humans were regarded as the usual species to play as characters, or the “traditional” nonhuman species of elves, dwarves, gnomes and halflings (usually referred in older material as “demi-humans”). Other nonhuman species like orcs, goblins, etc were not playable as characters, and regarded as monsters to be opponents for players. Additionally, the Flanaess is explicitly a human dominated region (implying other regions of Oerik or Oerth may not be). A DM can choose to follow the previously published material and have such “exotic” races as rare or unknown, or change their version of Greyhawk to allow for the more diverse range of species provided under the rules. Ultimately it is up to the DM and players how they want to run their Greyhawk campaign. 11 Humans Humans feature a number of ethnic groups, although the peoples of those groups have mixed over the last millennia such that little regard is had to them in most realms. Mixed Ethnicity Most lands of the Flanaess are populated by humans of mixed background. After almost a millennium of migration and intermingling, very few lands feature people from only one ethnic group. In any large and cosmopolitan city almost any human ethnicity and mixture can be found there. Baklunish Originating from the Baklunish Empire, the Baklunish tend to be long of limb and face, with high cheekbones and golden tone skin. They have straight, fine hair usually dark - from dusky brown to bluish black. Eyes are usually green or gray-green, with hazel and gray eyes rare. The people of Ekbir, Zeif, Ull, and the Tiger Nomads are of strong Baklunish heritage. Those of Tusmit and the Paynims show mixed Baklunish-Oeridian ancestry. The Wolf Nomads are often darker from intermarriage with the Flan of the Hunting Lands. Those of Ket are the least typically Baklunish, with pale yellow, golden-brown, or tan skin due to intermarriage with those of Suel and Oeridian ancestry. Baklunish wizards often excel in elemental, divination, summoning and binding magics, and clergy and desert mystics practice cooperative spells. Flan The Flan were the original human inhabitants of the Flanaess, and the name of the region is derived from their name. Pure born Flan have bronze skin, varying from dark, deep brown to a light copper hue. Their eyes are commonly amber, brown, dark brown, or black, with hair curly, wavy and brown to black. They have sturdy builds with strong, broad faces. Many traditional Flan have a strong affinity for nature, and this carries over into their wizards. Most respectable people shun necromantic magic, but a few delve into such which were mastered by the ancient ur-Flan. Druids are common amongst traditional Flan tribes. Oeridian/Oerid The Oeridians migrated into the Baklunish Basin where they served as mercenaries, before most of them emigrated on into the Flanaess. The dominant human ethnic group in much of the Flanaess and especially the Great Kingdom or former parts of it, Oeridians tend to tan to olive skin tone, and brown or auburn hair in color. However, some may have hair as blonde as honey or dark as black. Eye color varies, with brown and gray most common. Oeridian faces tend to have strong jaw lines, and square or oval shaped faces. In general, Oeridians are militaristic, self-sacrificing, and loyal, although those traits are less evident nowadays. They are prone to being temperamental and often seek to solve problems by violent means. They prefer a strict social order with themselves at the pinnacle and retain strong military traditions. Oerids have earned respect for their skill in warfare. In peacetime, they tend to be practical and hard-working and do not waste time on more intellectual pursuits. Suel/Suloise Even before the Suel Imperium was destroyed by the Rain of Colorless Fire, its people were on the move migrating into the Flanaess where many had already settled on the coasts and isles of the southern oceans. However, many were themselves conquered by the Oeridians, or were driven east and south towards the shores of the Solnor Ocean. The Suel are the lightest in complexion of the human ethnic groups of the Flanaess, having fair skin and an unusually high number of albinos. Eyes are usually pale blue or violet, ranging through to deep blue or gray for some. Hair is usually wiry and often curly or kinky, and dominated by hair colors such as blond, light red, and platinum blonde. Suel facial features tend to be lean and narrow. The Suel have a passion and willingness to engage in study, especially of arcane magic, for which the Suel Imperium was justly renowned. Many Suel wizards can reach great levels of power. Rhennee The Rhennee are not native to Oerth. They appeared mysteriously about 450 years ago near the Adri Forest in the Great Kingdom. They were soon driven away, fleeing west to the central Flanaess where they took up a life on the waters of the Nyr Dyv and connected rivers. A few took up a life traveling in wagons on land, and are known as the Attloi. The two groups treat each other with disdain - although they share nearly identical traditions, including adopting human children from lands they are traveling through. The Rhennee are olive to tan in complexion, with curly black or dark brown hair, and gray, blue or hazel eyes (with green occasionally seen in some families). They are generally short and wiry in build, with men being about 5’6” in height and women shorter. The Rhennee have never worshiped gods, and Rhennee clerics and divine magic users are unknown. The “wise women” and their female students utilize arcane magic, preferring charms, illusions, and divination spells. They are also known for selling love potions and minor protective charms - sometimes of dubious efficacy (when sold to outsiders). 12 Further Reading: •	Lance Hawvermale. “The Way of the Lake.” Living Greyhawk Journal #2. Wizards of the Coast, 2000. Olman The Olman trace their origin to northern Hepmonaland. War with the Touv of Hepmonaland, and internal strife, caused the collapse of their empire. The Olman abandoned their lands and cities, and spread across the islands of the Densac Gulf to the Amedio Jungle. Olman skin color ranges from a rich red-brown to dark brown, with their hair always straight and black, and their eyes dark ranging from medium brown to almost black. They have high cheekbones with high bridged noses, although these facial features tend to be stronger among the nobility. Olman battle magic tends to involve damaging many opponents in visibly intimidating ways. Divination spells to understand the world or the omens of their distant gods are also favored. Protective or healing magic for others tends to be rare. Touv The jungles of central and the savanna of southern Hepmonaland are home to a number of kingdoms of the Touv people. A thousand years ago the Touv were united under the rule of the Kingdom of Kunda. The armies of Kunda fought and destroyed the Olman kingdoms of the northern jungles. However, victory did not bring stability for the kings of Kunda, who saw their vassals throw off their rule one by one. Touv have dark brown or near black skin tones, straight or wavy black hair, and blue, brown, or, very rarely, black eyes. They generally have rounded facial features and are shorter than most peoples of the Flanaess, rarely standing taller than about 5’10”. Most Touv males cannot grow facial hair, although the men of a few tribes can grow narrow beards from their chins.

Elves Known as olve to the Flan, elves were present in the Flanaess prior to the first human kingdoms arising. Pushed from the plains by encroaching humans and others, they had withdrawn mainly to forests and upland areas by the time of the Twin Cataclysms. The encroaching newcomers forced them into alliances with dwarves, gnomes, halflings and eventually humans especially Oeridians. Elves in the Flanaess fall into several different types, all about 5 feet tall and light of build: High elves usually are green eyed and dark-haired. Most common and friendly of the elves of the Flanaess, they are often found living amongst or dealing with other species especially humans. Gray elves usually have amber eyes and pale golden hair, or violet eyes and silvery hair. Noble and haughty, they reside in isolated strongholds. Wood or sylvan elves tend to hazel or green eyes, with hair color ranging from coppery red to yellow. Tending to value strength over learning, they are boisterous and fun loving by elven standards. While they are reclusive while residing in in forest redoubts, they deal with human wood folk and other species who respect nature like themselves. Wild or grugach elves are the smallest of the Flanaess elves, otherwise resembling wood elves. They are even more reclusive and live a simpler lifestyle in the wilderness than other elves. The valley elves of the Valley of the Mage are different to other elves, with the appearance of gray elves but of nearly human height. They are estranged for unknown reasons (to non-elves, and even many elves) from other elves. Elves are currently dominant in Celene, Sunndi, High- folk, the Vesve Forest, and the Lendore Isles. Elves have long been fascinated by magic, and produce beautiful magic items. They worship deities of the elven pantheon, but also respect and pay homage to Ehlonna as Ehlenestra. Drow elves are not usually seen on the surface of Oerth. Their reputation is as dangerous and evil, and so they will be viewed with suspicion amongst most other species especially surface elves. Only in the most cosmopolitan locations used to numerous and exotic visitors, such as the Free City of Greyhawk, might such folk be found and accepted (and then only after they establish their reputation). Dwarves Known as dwur to the Flan, in the Flanaess they are either hill or mountain dwarves. Hill dwarves are more common, and have skin complexions of deep tan to light brown, and hair of gray, brown, or black. Their eyes can be of any color except blue. Of solid build, they rarely are more than 4 feet in height. Mountain dwarves have lighter complexions and are slightly taller than hill dwarves. Little is known of dwarven origins by outsiders, but what is known is they previously resided in great halls under the northern Crystalmists destroyed by the Invoked Devastation. The last High King was killed, and the fragmented clans have since been led by lords and princes of various noble houses. The fleeing dwarven clans allied with elves and gnomes in defence during the Great Migrations, and with reliable humans. Dwarves are now found in rugged mountains and hills of the Flanaess, in particular the Lortmils, the Hestmarks, the Crystalmists, the Iron Hills, the Principality of Ulek, and Ratik. 13 Halflings Known as hobniz to the Flan, they have three distinct ethnic groups in the Flanaess: Most common are the lightfoot (also referred to as lightfeet), who average about 3 feet tall and are normally ruddy faced, with brown hair and eyes of various shades. Next most numerous are the stouts, who are usually slightly shorter than lightfoots with broader features and coarser hair. Least common are the tallfellows - usually taller, slimmer, and with fairer complexions than lightfoots. All halflings usually have wavy or curly hair but only some, particularly stouts, grow hair on their facial cheeks. Halflings originated in the Flanaess in the river valleys of the west-central Flanaess, being the Sheldomar, Fals, and Velverdya, after which they slowly spread to other areas. By the time of the Great Migrations they had spread as far north as the Gamboge Forest and east as the Harp River. Halflings are found throughout the Sheldomar Valley, living amongst the humans, dwarves, elves and gnomes there. They favor stable realms ruled by stronger peoples throughout the Flanaess, and can be found especially in the central and western regions stretching from the three Uleks to the Urnst states. Their most famous homeland is Elmshire in the Domain of Greyhawk, on the southern coast of the Nyr Dyv. Further Reading •	Roger Moore. “A Halfling Haven”. Dragon Magazine #262. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, Aug 1999. Gnomes Known as noniz to the Flan, there are three major groups found in the Flanaess - forest and rock gnomes (most commonly found on the surface) and deep gnomes (who inhabit the Underdark). The origin of surface gnomes in the Flanaess is said to have been as herders and trappers in the remote northern wooded highlands. They began expanding south several centuries before the Twin Cataclysms, moving into the lands inhabited by other species. Their leaders recognized the authority of elven or dwarven sovereigns in these new areas, but avoided any general intermixing with other species until the Great Migrations lead to cooperation between species. Over that time the surface gnomes have developed into the forest and rock gnomes groups. Forest gnomes tend to inhabit forested areas such as the Celene, the Grandwood and Highfolk. Rock gnomes tend to dwell in great burrow communities in hilly or mountainous areas such as the Lortmils and Kron Hills, and east in the Flinty Hills or Gull Cliffs in the Great Kingdom. The origins of deep gnomes is a mystery to most species of the Flanaess, as they are rarely seen on the surface. Their home is said to be a vast realm within a cavern, miles beneath the surface, ruled by a brooding, wise monarch. Surface gnomes are renowned illusionists, artificers and crafters including of cloth and clothes. Other Species Many wild tribes of other species live on the fringes of civilized realms, mainly orcs (euroz to the Flan), goblins (jebli), gnolls (kell), hobgoblins (hoch jebline), kobolds (celbit), ogres (eiger), bugbears (buchveer) and trolls (trullent). Many of these came to the Flanaess as part of the Great Migrations, after being employed as mercenaries in the Suel-Baklunish wars. Various other species like lizard folk, bullywugs etc also dwell on the fringes. Given their reputation, members of these species will tend to be viewed with suspicion if not fear in most areas of the Flanaess inhabited by humans or the above other species. Given the Baklunish dealings with elementals and djinn, genasi might be found in those lands. Tieflings are not usually seen in most parts of the Flanaess. However, the presence of and dealing with fiends (demons and devils) in Iuz and the Great Kingdom means they might be encountered and accepted (rather than being reviled as in most places) here, at least in some parts. Warforged might have been used in the Baklunish- Suloise Wars, and be found a milllenia later. Likewise, they might be found in the City of the Gods in Arn (Blackmoor), or buried in the Land of Black Ice as relics of a disappeared ancient empire. Beyond this they are likely to be one off unique creations by inventors or mages ancient or modern. Dragonborn and other exotic species are very rare in the Flanaess. However, that does not mean they might not originate from elsewhere in Oerik or Oerth, and be present. Further Reading •	Roger E. Moore. “Part Dragon, All Hero”. Dragon Magazine #206, TSR 1994. While not all species are common or even usually found in the Flanaess, a DM should be able to develop a backstory with a player wanting to play such in the Flanaess. However, part of playing such a character will usually involve them being unusual in that part of Oerth (unless the 14 DM has modified or developed the Flanaess such that this is not the case). Languages Only five human dialects are common enough to be considered languages in the Flanaess: Baklunish: Ancient Baklunish was the language of the Baklunish Empire. It is still spoken by the nomads of the Plains of the Paynims, and by the faithful of the deity Al’Akbar. It is the language of all official and religious documents west of the Yatil Mountains. Low Baklunish are the contemporary, colloquial Baklunish dialects, descended from Ancient Baklunish but much changed by time. Common: A mixture of Ancient Baklunish and Old Oeridian created this newer language used by merchants and traders throughout the Flanaess. Sages theorize its true roots lie in the years when the Oeridians dwelled in the Baklunish Basin. The spread of the Great Kingdom ensured its universality, even in Keoland. Flan: Still spoken amongst the Tenha and remnant Flan tribes, this ancient language still survives only in pockets and there in dialects that have developed due to their separation. Old Oeridian: The language of the Oeridians brought with them on the Great Migrations, it remains in use for legal and religious matters in the Great Kingdom and various realms. Suloise: Little spoken anymore, its knowledge is mostly preserved to read the ancient histories and arcane texts that survive from the Suel Imperium. The Frozen Tongue used by the Crustii, Fruztii and Schnai (often referred to as “Rhizians” as a group) is a descendent of it. 15 Chapter 3: Chapter 3: Realms of the Flanaess Realms of the Flanaess T his chapters sets out basic details of the various realms of the Flanaess in 576 CY. It is based on the information as at 576 CY set out in the 1983 Gold Box, using the formatting of information contained in the D&D Gazetteer published in 2000 (detailing the Flanaess in 591 CY) and also using information from the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer (likewise detailing 591 CY) as it related to information and events up to 576 CY. The details provided are as follows: Title: The title for each realm is the name most often used for it. Proper Name: The realm’s official name for itself. 16 Ruler: The name and title(s) of the current head of state. Where such differs from the DMG 2024 this is noted. Basic details of each showing alignment, sex, and species are provided. Abbreviations for alignment are as follows: C=Chaotic E=Evil G=Good L=Lawful N=Neutral. Government: Brief description of the system of government. Major Settlements: The capital city (if any) followed by other important settlements listed alphabetically. Not all settlements are listed. Resources: Any materials produced in sufficient amounts to be exported. Common resources include: foodstuffs being livestock, game animals, fish, grains & breads, cheeses, dried fruits & vegetables, alcoholic drinks; some food items are named if prominent. Gems which fall into 4 categories, by value of stone: I (about 10 gp), II (about 50 gp), III (about 100-500gp), and IV (1,000 gp or more). Population: The main species making up the realm’s population, being at least 1% of the realm’s population. In most realms humans make up 75-85% of the population or more. Law: An indication of the legal system and/or respect for the law based on the alignment system. Allies: The states and major organizations usually acting in support of that realm. Alliances with qualifiers are noted. Enemies: The states and major organizations which are opposing, and actively attempting to defeat, the current ruler or government actively (by raiding or warfare) or clandestinely (by assassination or sabotage). States which are distrusted or have sanctions in place are noted. Aerdiaak (North Province) Proper Name: Viceroyalty of the North Province of the Great Kingdom of Aerdy Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Herzog Varz Grenell (human)) His Radiant Grace Grenell, Herzog of the North Province; Grand Prince of House Naelax [LE male human] Government: Viceroyal appointment by Overking, owed fealty by various lesser nobles within the province Major Settlements: Eastfair; Atirr, Bellport, Darnagal, Edgefield, Kaport Bay, King’s Justice, Luvern, Stringen Resources: Foodstuffs, cloth, electrum, whale oil Population: Human, Orc, Goblin, Halfling, Half-orc Law: LE Allies: Great Kingdom, Ahlissa (South Province), Rel Astra, Medegia, Sea Baronies (all political rivals) Enemies: Nyrond, Almor, Ratik, Cruski (Ice Barbarians), Fruztii (Frost Barbarians), Schnai (Snow Barbarians), Bone March, Lordship of the Isles The population of this part of the Great Kingdom is dominated by humans, with a strong Oeridian-Flan mix, and few members of the other usual species live here. Large numbers of orcs and goblins have lived here for centuries serving as troops, although recent decades have seen a growing dependence on and increase in such numbers. Some see the presence of these orc and goblin bands as a danger, but Herzog Grenell uses them as a threat to every prince and lord under his rule. The Herzog is a cousin to the Overking, and as ruthless and cold-blooded without the madness Ivid suffers from at times. He is also head of the Church of Hextor in the north, giving him secular and religious power. Grenell has to deal with various external threats in the form of sea raids by the Rhizians (Cruski, Fruztii & Schnai), the nonhuman tribes and bandits of the Bone March, and border skirmishes with Nyrond and Almor including their recent capture of Knurl. Ongoing incursions and the defeat of a force near Bellport by nonhuman tribes across the Tesser Torrent have led to rumors the Herzog is seeking Imperial funding for mercenary men-at-arms and rival Bone March nonhuman tribes to recapture the southern March. Internal threats include the usual political infighting of the Great Kingdom, and the mad rule of his cousin.

Ahlissa (South Province) Proper Name: Viceroyalty of the South Province of the Great Kingdom of Aerdy Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Herzogin Seprenna Calyn (human)) His High and Radiant Grace Chelor III, the Herzog of the South Province; Fasstal of Ahlissa, Idee and Sunndi; Overlord of Onnwal; Grand Prince of House Naelax [NE male human] Government: Viceroyal appointment by Overking, owed fealty by various lesser nobles within the province Major Settlements: Zelradton; Benkend, Hexpools, Prymp, Shargallen, Trennenport Resources: Foodstuffs, silver Population: Human, Halfling, Half-orc, Orc, Goblin, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome Law: LE Allies: Great Kingdom, Aerdiaak, Rel Astra, Medegia, Sea Baronies (all political rivals) Enemies: Nyrond, Almor, Onnwal, Irongate, Iron Hills, Idee, Sunndi, Lordship of the Isles After the Aerdi tribe of the Oeridians had established their first kingdom on the Solnor Coast, their first major conquest was of the fading Flan kingdom of Ahlissa in the Flanmi River 17 valley. These fertile lands were to become the breadbasket of the Kingdom of Aerdy that expanded over time to become the Great Kingdom. By 100 CY these lands had become the center of the South Province, one of four provinces ruled by a viceroy for the Overking. The province was previously larger and richer. However, as the Great Kingdom shrank the lands throwing off the yoke of the Overking included parts of the South Province including Onnwal, Irongate, Idee, and Sunndi. The current Herzog, despite being a cousin of the Overking, is in disfavor as his recent attempts to win back those fiefs and their rich tax revenues have failed. The remaining lands are densely populated, and clustered in various large river cities, in the fief of Ahlissa and the central lands around Hexpools and the Thelly River. Parts are claimed by the Censor of Medegia, seeking to exploit the Herzog’s disgrace. The people are largely of Oeridian-Suel stock, with some orcs and goblinoids, and the few elves, gnomes, and halflings in the forests and hills. The Herzog has committed his entire personal fortune in one last attempt to break the Iron League, regain his lands and titles as well as favor in Rauxes, and refill his coffers. Much of his levies are considered unreliable. However, those of the petty nobles and gentry serving the Herzog are reliable, and its heavy cavalry is considered highly effective. Exceptionally well-armed and equipped mercenary men-at-arms make the Army of the South formidable. The Herzog also maintains a fair naval force out of Prymp and Shargallen that continually seeks to contest Nyrond’s domination of Relmor Bay. The Herzog’s ambitions mean a major war seems likely. If so, Nyrond and Almor can be expected to support the Iron League in any conflict. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. “Sorcerer’s Scroll: Developments from Stonefist to South Province”.

Almor Proper Name: Prelacy of Almor Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Prelate Xanther Klimstyn (human)) His Venerable Mercy, Kevont, the Prelate of Almor [LG male human] Government: Prelacy; government by council of clerics who select a prelate to lead Major Settlements: Chathold; Flessern, Harskern, Innspa, Millennium, Narsel Mendred, Silverwat, Tirian Resources: Foodstuffs, Cloth, Copper, Timber Population: Human, Halfling, Elf, Gnome Law: LG Allies: Nyrond, Ruling families of Rel Deven, Iron League (Irongate, Onnwal, Idee, Sunndi, Lordship of the Isles) Enemies: Great Kingdom, Ahlissa, Aerdiaak NOTE: The DMG 2024 indicates the Bone March was recently occupied by Nyrond and Almor. In published sources the March had been occupied by nonhuman tribes since 563 CY, although Knurl was recently taken by Nyrond-Almor forces. Almor lies between the Kingdom of Nyrond and the western Great Kingdom. The realm features the Harp, Flessern and Lyre Rivers. The Harp enters Relmor Bay near Chathold, Almor’s capital. The eastern region of Almor is covered by a large swath of the Adri Forest, a thick, dangerous forest that reaches all the way to the Flinty Hills to the north and to the Bone March on Almor’s north- eastern border. Within the western fringe of the Adri Forest is the city of Innspa, a popular resort town that caters to the wealthy and influential members of Almor and surrounding regions. Narsel Mendred, the second largest city in Almor, sits at the confluence of the Flessern and Harp Rivers, midway between Chathold and Innspa. To the south along the coast are fertile plains and copper-rich hills, with the Thelwood on the southern border of Almor. Almor gained full independence from the Great Kingdom in 450 CY. Since then, it has been ruled by a religious council comprising mainly followers of Pholtus, Pelor, and Heironeous. The various nobles and Lord Mayor of Innspa swear allegiance to the reigning prelate who is usually a high priest. The realm is strongly committed to freedom and justice based on religious precepts, but is only loosely organized administratively The people of Almor have strong Oeridian backgrounds with a mixture of Suel and Flan, making them a people of mixed culture with a generally friendly disposition even toward strangers. Almorians are hard-working, and the majority of the population are farmers, herdsmen, fishers, and miners. Almor is a country of rich, arable fields and meadows, fast flowing rivers and streams, and ore laden, rocky hills. It is strongly allied with and supported by Nyrond, standing together against the Great Kingdom. Recently joint forces took Knurl in the Blemu Hills, irking Herzog Grenell of Aerdiaak.

Blackmoor Town and Castle Blackmoor have been referred to here, but presumably would be renamed Arn Town and Castle Arn. This remote Archbarony sits between the Icy Sea and the Burneal Forest. The Land of Black Ice sits to the north, and includes the northern Cold Marshes and the Gloomfens. Scattered villages and stockades dot the lands, many huddling near hot springs and volcanic vents. Monsters thrive in the wilderness of brush and marsh. These lands were originally inhabited by the Flan, but with the Great Migrations elements of the Suel then the Oeridians intruded here. Eventually the Great Kingdom extended its empire even here, and it fell under the rule of the viceroyalty of Ferrond. When Ferrond seceded Blackmoor was left alone again, cut off for a time when the Relentless Horde swept across the north. Fifty years ago, orc forces under the command of the mysterious Egg of Coot conquered and destroyed Blackmoor Town some 50 years ago, and hold it still. The lands surrounding his stronghold are populated by “automata” created by him. Adventurers have long traveled to this land to explore the ancient and mysterious City of the Gods, and the dungeons beneath Castle Blackmoor. Little is known of the Archbaron who maintains no diplomatic contacts with rulers of other realms. His forces are weak, and his lands poor. In addition to the forces of the Egg of Coot, and various monsters, the kobolds of the Burneal Forest are a constant menace. Unknown magics suffuse these lands, and the many standing stones and mounds are said to have been created by a supposed group of ur-Flan sorcerers - the Northern Adepts - to try to hold back the Black Ice. Iuz also seems to avoid this land. Locals employ slings, short bows, and spears, with the only real cavalry a small force in the service of the Archbaron. Further Reading •	Dave Arneson.

Bandit Kingdoms Proper Name: Combination of Free Lords Ruler: Various petty warlords and tyrants (in DMG 2024 - Renfus the Mottled indicated to rule Stoink), including Boss Dhaelhy of Stoink Government: (in DMG 2024 - Four to six bandit lords) Seventeen loosely allied petty dictatorships Major Settlements: No capital; Alhaster, Balmund, Groucester, Hallorn, Kinemeet, Marsakeer, Narleon, Riftcrag, Rookroost, Sarresh, Senningford, Stoink Resources: Silver Population: Human, Half-orc Law: CN Allies: Continually shifting alliances with other free lords, Horned Society (sometimes) Enemies: Shield Lands, Hunting Lands, Tenh, County of Urnst, Duchy of Urnst, Theocracy of the Pale, Nyrond, Knights of Holy Shielding, Knights of the Hart NOTE: The map in DMG 2024 shows parts of the Bandit Kingdoms held by the Shield Lands which in previous published sources were not. The number of bandit lords is also far lower in DMG 2024. The flat and featureless land here is arable, but rocky and over farmed for grain and cattle. This discourages large settlements, and has led to a history of poor farmers turning to banditry against the trade caravans travelling between the small towns. While the climate is temperate, winters can be harsh and long, and summers hot and often bring drought. The area is dominated by the Rift Canyon, one of the most spectacular geographical features of the Flanaess, and theories abound as to its creation or origin. These lands were only loosely settled before the Oeridians arrived, and not much more after and then ruled by ill favored nobles and outcasts. Nominally under the control of the viceroyalty of Ferrond, these “Middle Lands” fell into lawlessness after the rule of the Overking was thrown off. The various petty barons established their fiefdoms, and loosely aligned themselves as the “Combination of Free Lords”. They became such a threat to the southern lords that they united as the Shield Lands in the early 300s CY, and two centuries of near constant war or skirmishing followed. The local lords make frequent war on each other, uniting only when threatened by outside forces (such as the Shield Lands, Tenh or the Horned Society). 19 Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. “Protection circles and the like, plus news of the north central Flanaess”.

Bissel Proper Name: March of Bissel Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Margrave Imran Redulkar (human)) His Lofty Grace, Walgar, the Margrave of Bissel [LN human male] Government: Frontier march of Furyondy Major Settlements: Thornward; Pellak Resources: Foodstuffs, cloth, gold, gems (I) Population: Human, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Halfling Law: LN Allies: Furyondy, Geoff, Gran March, Keoland, Ulek states, Veluna Enemies: Ket This area has long been the crossroads of trade and travel between the Baklunish Basin, the Sheldomar Valley and the rest of the Flanaess (via the Velverdyva valley). The “Littlemark” was once the northern frontier of Keoland. Bissel was founded 275 years ago only to be lost at the end of Keoland’s expansionist phase 140 years ago as a result of the Short War with Furyondy. At that time, it became a province of Furyondy, gaining palatinate status after its ruler (Margrave Rollo) saved the life of the king of Furyondy, Hugh III. Since then, it has rebuilt relations with Keoland and the Gran March, though it remains a vassal of Furyondy. Its main focus is on Ket, which has invaded it in the past and remains a constant threat. Bissel sees itself as the bulwark for the Flanaess against invasion from the west, and adventurers regularly serve in the Border Companies that comprise its army. The people of Bissel are primarily Oeridian-Suloise from Keoland mixed with Oerid-Flan from Furyondy and minor Baklunish elements from Ket. The dwarves of the mountains are strong allies of the humans though they remain distant. The margrave, Walgar, was a ranger of some renown in his day. 20 Bone March Proper Name: The Bone March Ruler: None Government: (in DMG 2024 - controlled by armies from Almor and Nyrond) Formerly a feudal march subject to the Great Kingdom, now controlled by a conclave of nonhuman tribal chiefs Major Settlements: Spinecastle; Knurl, Johnsport Resources: Silver, gems (I, II) Population: Human, Orc, Goblin, Gnoll, Ogre, Halfling, Gnome, Elf, Dwarf Law: LE Allies: Aerdiaak (tenuous) Enemies: Nyrond, Ratik, Fruztii, Cruski, Schnai NOTE: The DMG 2024 indicates the Bone March was recently occupied by Nyrond and Almor. In published sources the March had been occupied by nonhuman tribes since 563 CY, although Knurl was recently taken by Nyrond-Almor forces. Originally settled by the Fruztii Suel from the north, the Great Kingdom dealt with incessant raids on their lands by seeking to drive them out of this strip of land between the Rakers and Grendep Bay. Initial skirmishing soon escalated into full blown warfare in 108 CY, and the local Fruztii called on their tribal allies to descend on the Aerdi forces. The next year at the Battle of Shamblefield an Aerdi host was almost destroyed, but the day was saved by the charge of Caldni Vir who was made first Marquis of the March by Overking Manshen in reward. The skeletons of the dead from that battle resulted in the place being named the Bone March due to the remains persisting for decades. The March was the northern border of the Great Kingdom until the founding of Ratik. The March stood strong until the 550s when regular nonhuman raids from the Rakers began. In 563 CY orcs entered Spinecastle by secret ways and took the fortified capital. Within three years the entire March had fallen to the invaders. Marquis Clement is missing and presumed dead. Nonhuman (mainly orcs, gnolls, ogres and goblins) tribes from the Rakers control most of the Bone March; while petty bandit chiefs rule the remaining humans and raid Ratik and Aerdiaak. The county of Knurl holds out, along with various hidden gnome strongholds in the Blemu Hills. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. “Sorcerer’s Scroll: Developments from Stonefist to South Province”.

Celene allied with Keoland for a brief period before objecting to its northern conquests and expelling Keoish garrisons. Celene then used diplomatic pressure to ensure the Uleks separated from Keoland. These actions led directly to the Hateful Wars and the collapse of relations between Celene and the Uleks. Since then, Celene has become increasingly isolationist, although some elements such as the Knights of Luna resist that policy. Further, its relations with the free cities of Dyvers and Greyhawk have declined in recent decades as those two cities try to expand their influence into the Gnarley Forest. Celene is dominated by the gray elves of its royal court. A significant population of gnomes lives within its borders, mainly in the mountains to the west and the hills to the north. The human population is primarily a Flan-Suel mix with Oerid admixture, more related to the population of the Wild Coast and Greyhawk than to those in Keoland. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax.

Chakyik (Tiger Nomads) Proper Name: Chakyik Horde Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Lord Agul Krusuf (human)) The Unvanquishable Tiger Lord, Ilkhan Gajtak of the Chakyik Hordes [CE male human] Government: Numerous nomad clans loosely ruled by the most powerful noble of the royal clan Major Settlements: Yecha Resources: Furs and hides, silver,gems (I) Population: Human, Halfling, Elf Law: CN Allies: None Enemies: Burneal Forest tribes, Wegwiur (sometimes), Perrenland (sometimes), Ekbir (sometimes) The Chakyik are herders and hunters who freely roam the steppes, engaging in trade with the people of Ekbir, Perrenland, and the Wegwiur (Wolf Nomads). However, they are also known for raiding and occasionally participating in the slave trade, and rumors of lycanthropy among them have been confirmed. Their armies are similar to those of other northern nomads, but women warriors and warrior-priestesses are much more common among them. Many rumors surround these female troops, including tales that they still perform male sacrifices as was their practice in ancient times. Further Reading •	Don Turnbull (editor). Fiend Folio.

Cruski (Ice Barbarians) Proper Name: Kingdom of the Cruski Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Queen Tharla of the Cruski (human)) His Most Ferocious Majesty, Lolgoff Bearhear, the King] of Cruski, Fasstal of all the Suelii [CN male human] Government: Independent feudal monarchy with hereditary rulership, though with little actual control over jarls who act independently of one another; the king controls the area around the capital, and farms within 30-50 miles Major Settlements: Glot; Jotsplat Resources: Furs, copper, gems (I), rare wood (sablewood, not exported) Population: Human, Halfling, Elf Law: CN Allies: Schnai (Snow Barbarians) (sometimes) Enemies: Sea Barons, Stonehold, Aerdiaak, Fruztii (sometimes), Ratik (sometimes), Schnai (sometimes) Living in seaside and mountain towns, the Cruski tribes sustain themselves through hunting, fishing, and whaling. Shipbuilding is also vital to their way of life, directly supporting another key pursuit - piracy. Seasonal raids on southern lands bring both wealth and the chance for battle that all Cruski eagerly seek. 22 These raids were once regarded by more civilized kingdoms as minor annoyances, only requiring local defense. However, recent rumors of secret meetings between the Cruski and Schnai have raised concerns in the southern kingdoms. The two sets of tribes are planning a major raid, perhaps targeting the Sea Baronies or the Lordship of the Isles? These realms, and others, would pay handsomely to uncover more information.

Dyvers Proper Name: Free Lands of Dyvers Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Magister Thymantia Gortoz (aasimar)) His Excellency Margus, Magister of Dyvers [N male human] Government: Democratic meritocracy; magister elected for undefined term of office on the basis of personal achievement by the Gentry of Dyvers (the local minor nobles, landowners, and wealthy merchants) Major Settlements: Dyvers; Caltaran, Maraven Resources: Shipbuilding supplies, foodstuffs (fish, meat, cheeses, local ales), clothing Population: Human, Gnome, Halfling, Elf, Dwarf, Half-elf, Half-orc Law: N Allies: Furyondy, Veluna, Verbobonc, Shield Lands, Greyhawk (bitter rival) Enemies: Empire of Iuz, the Pomarj, denizens of the Gnarley Forest The “City of Sails” is one of the great cities of the Flanaess, located at the western end of the Nyr Dyv on the mouth of the Velverdyva River. Originally a part of the Viceroyalty of Ferrond and then the Kingdom of Furyondy when it seceded from the Great Kingdom in 254 CY, it served as capital for both. However, the new King Thrommel set out to build a new capital at Chendl, and moved there in 288 CY. In time the influence and perceived restrictive policies of Veluna within the kingdom saw it declare independence in 526 CY, claiming some 2,000 square miles of surrounding lands. King Thrommel II did not contest the decision of the Gentry of Dyvers, although the city pays taxes to Furyondy in return for military protection beyond its own small army and navy. It rivals the Free City of Greyhawk as a trade center, although Greyhawk supplanting it over time has created bitterness in Dyvers against what it sees as an upstart. It is rumored that, in the aftermath of the defeat of the Horde of Elemental Evil and destruction of the Temple near Hommlet in 569 CY, some escapees from the Temple made their way to the city and infiltrated the criminal elements there.

Ekbir Proper Name: (in DMG 2024 - Sultanate of Ekbir) Caliphate of Ekbir Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Sultan Xargun II (aasimar)) His Sublime Magnificence, the Sultan of Ekbir, Xargun [NG human male] Government: Aristocratic theocracy; ruler must be a high-ranking cleric from one of five royal clans Major Settlements: Ekbir; Kofeh, Fashtri Resources: Foodstuffs, cloth, wood, ship building Population: Human, Halfling, Elf Law: LG Allies: Tusmit (sometimes), Zeif (sometimes) Enemies: Zeif (sometimes), Tusmit (sometimes), Chakyik (sometimes), Ket (sometimes), Knights of the Watch The sultanate was settled centuries ago by peoples fleeing the devastating Baklunish-Suloise Wars. It is a large coastal domain on the Dramidj Ocean, bordering its neighbors Zeif and Tusmit. Its northern forest border is shared with the nomadic Chakyik tribe, and inhabited by elves. Ekbir is known for its extensive trade, thriving society, and political stability. The sultanate is defended by a strong navy second only to Zeif. In addition, prosperous Ekbir one of the largest, most metropolitan cities in the world. It is the greatest center of learning in the west with sages coming to access knowledge 23 of fallen empires or to join the Zashassar, the most ancient school of magic in the Flanaess. Traders from all states in the western Flanaess are found here. In particular, large populations of halflings and elves are attracted to Ekbir for its comforts and security. Fruztii (Frost Barbarians) Proper Name: North Kingdom of the Fruztii Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - King Hundgred of the Fruztii (human)) His Most Warlike Majesty, King Ralff of the Fruztii CN male human Government: Hereditary feudal monarchy Major Settlements: Krakenheim; Djekul Resources: Foodstuffs (plus fish), furs, silver, gold, iron, timber, shipbuilding supplies Population: Human, Dwarf, Halfling Law: CN Allies: Ratik, dwarf and gnome clans in Griff and Corusk Mountains Enemies: Empire of Iuz, Stonehold, North Kingdom, Bone March, Sea Barons, Cruski (sometimes), Schnai (sometimes) Suel refugees migrated to the Thillonrian Peninsula as part of the Great Migrations, and call these lands Rhizia. The Fruztii are the weakest of the three tribes, having never recovered from the Battle of Shamblefield in the Bone March against the Great Kingdom in 109 CY. They have been vassals of the Schnai for the last 20 years or so, and several periods prior. King Ralff was a supposed figurehead put on the throne by the Schnai, but has proven a canny ruler. He has rebuilt his kingdom and established an alliance with Ratik, and his tribe is now independent in all but oath. A Fruztii and Ratik joint force inflicted heavy casualties during a campaign against the Bone March, and then next season drove out Stonehold forces from the northern pass. Longships of the Fruztii raid the southern coasts in the spring. The crews of these ships are typical Rhizian warriors: brave but undisciplined. In contrast the king’s soldiers are well armed, trained and organized. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. “Sorcerer’s Scroll: Developments from Stonefist to South Province”. Dragon Magazine #57.

Furyondy Proper Name: Kingdom of Furyondy Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - King Belvor IV (human)) His Pious Majesty, the King of Furyondy, Belvor IV [LG male human] Government: Feudal monarchy, hereditary kingship (no current heir) limited by Noble Council Major Settlements: Chendl; Crockport, Gorsend, Grabford, Littleberg, Redoubt, Willip Resources: Foodstuffs, cloth, gold, wines, fish, shipbuilding supplies Population: Human, Elf, Halfling, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-elf, Half-orc Law: LG Allies: Veluna, Shield Lands, Highfolk, Ulek States, Verbobonc, Dyvers, Knights of the Hart Enemies: Empire of Iuz, Horned Society, Bandit Kingdoms The Great Kingdom established the viceroyalty of Ferrond in about 100 CY to rule the western lands it had conquered and to continue its expansion. As the Overking’s rule waned, the viceroy ruled more at their own discretion and eventually Thrommel I declared himself king in 254 CY. Over time the outer lands that made up part of the viceroyalty were lost, but Furyondy has remained a strong realm allied with Veluna and various other previous vassals. 479 CY saw the emergence of Iuz as a power in the north, leading to the eventual loss of much of the Northern Reaches. Iuz’s disappearance left Furyondy to lapse back into focusing on internal politics, but his return bodes ill for Furyondy even if southern nobles can see no threat justifying higher taxes or levies. Furyondy fields a formidable standing army, with its legendary belled heavy cavalry and famed light infantry from the Vesve Forest. Its navy controls the Whyestil Lake and also enforces order on the Nyr Dyv. The king of Furyondy governs with the backing of the Seven Families, each of whom controls one of the kingdom’s provinces. Although the king holds preeminence, each noble maintains a court that rivals his in splendor and opulence. Rivalry for prestige is not uncommon among the provinces. The disappearance of Belvor’s heir, Prince Thrommel, several years ago has created a potential power vacuum in the realm, and theories abound as to the cause and who is behind it.

Geoff fought a brief war with Keoland at the end of the Keoish imperial era, but relations have long since been mended. Apart from that war, its isolated position makes it difficult for any other realms to invade. However, it has constantly had to deal with incursions of ogres and giants from the Crystalmists. The people of Geoff are primarily of Flan stock, mixed with the Oeridian-Suel of Keoland. The elves of the Hornwood, Oytwood, and Dim Forest have long been allies of the people of Geoff, but they retain their independence. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. G1-3 Against the Giants.

Gran March Proper Name: Gran March Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Commandant Magnus Onyxbeard (dwarf)) His Most Resolute Magnitude, Petros, Commandant of Gran March [LN human male] Government: Feudal monarchy, structured along military lines, with minor fealty to Keoland; noble houses and government are closely entwined with a militant quasi- religious knighthood, the Knights of the Watch; commandant chosen every five years by vote of nobles and knights Major Settlements: Hookhill; Froghome (in DMG 2024 - previously called Shibboleth) Resources: Foodstuffs, cloth, copper, gems (III) Population: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Half-elf, Half-orc Law: LN Allies: Bissel, Geoff, Keoland, Sterich, Ulek States Enemies: Ket Gran March was established by a military order of knights to secure the frontier against cultists of Vecna after the Kingdom of Keoland was founded. Centuries later its focus turned to Ket and the forces invading from that land. Gran March became the base for the military expansion into Ket and Veluna, and its commander died in the Short War with Furyondy when Bissel was lost. Since that time the Commandant has been an elected position rather than an appointed one, though the Knights of the Watch maintain a dominant position in the politics of the province. The people of Gran March are mixed Oerid-Suel with a strong Flan element, particularly among the common people. They manage good relations with the neighboring elves of Ulek and the Dim Forest, and have a lively trade with the dwarves and gnomes of the mountains. Great Kingdom Proper Name: The Great Kingdom of Aerdy Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Overking Ivid V (human)) His Celestial Transcendency, the Overking of Aerdy, Grand Prince Ivid V of the North; Archduke of Ahlissa, Idee, and Sunndi; Suzerain of Medegia; Commander of the Bone March; Lord of the Sea Barons; Protector of Almor and Onnwal; Hetman of all the Aerdi; etc., etc. [NE male human] Government: Feudal monarchy with various palatinate provinces, and assorted noble fiefdoms owing fealty Major Settlements: Rauxes; Delaric, Dustbridge, Jalpa, Kalstrand, Loutharn, Torrich, Nulbish, Orred Ralsand, Rel Deven, Rinloru, Winetha Resources: Foodstuffs, cloth, silver, gold, copper, gems (IV) Population: Human, Halfling, Gnome, Elf, Dwarf, Half-orc Law: LE Allies: Ahlissa, Aerdiaak, Rel Astra, Medegia, Sea Baronies (all fiefdoms or palatinate states under nominal rule) Enemies: Nyrond, Almor, Onnwal, Irongate, Idee, Sunndi, Lordship of the Isles, Bone March, Ratik, Cruski, Fruzti, Schnai The Aerdi tribe of the Oeridians ended their migration on the Solnor Coast, and established the Kingdom of Aerdy with Rel Astra as its original capital. It then expanded over the centuries to control much of the Flanaess except Keoland and the Baklunish states. The Common Year calendar started in 645 OR when Grand Prince Nasran of House Cranden declared himself Overking and universal peace throughout the Great Kingdom. However, while previously the most powerful force for order and good, it began a slow decline from about 200 CY as the prophesized Age of Sorrow began. Rulership declined and provinces began seceding. 25 When the last House Rax Overking Nalif was assassinated by House Naelax assassins in 437 CY, the realm descended into the civil war known as the Turmoil Between Crowns. Prince Ivid of House Naelax was able to win the crown after years of fighting, at the price of ceding power to various provinces to buy their loyalty - Rel Astra, Medegia, Aerdiaak and Ahlissa. Under Naelax rule the Great Kingdom slid further into decadence and misrule. The current monarch, Ivid V, is crafty and devious, but reputedly mad. His control is limited to the Royal Demesne surrounding the capital, but beyond that only by threat and persuasion. The Overking’s Companion Guard of 10 select companies assists in doing so. While Aerdiaak and Ahlissa are each ruled as essentially a palatinate state by a Naelax cousin, incursions from the Bone March have caused the Herzog Grenell of the North to seek support from the Malachite Throne, and the challenges of the Iron League have caused Herzog Chelor in the south to cooperate with Ivid (see Aerdiaak and Ahlissa). The Constable-Mayor of Rel Astra and the Censor of Medegia spar politically with the Overking. The Sea Baronies pay tribute to conduct essentially piratical operations against other realms’ shipping as privateers under the Overking’s letters of marque.

Greyhawk Proper Name: Free City of Greyhawk Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Lord Mayor Nerof Gasgol (human)) His Solemn Authority, the Lord Mayor of Greyhawk, Nerof Gasgal [LN male human] Government: Lord Mayor elected by an oligarchy representing the city’s major mercantile, military, legal, economic, criminal, religious, and magical guilds Major Settlements: Greyhawk; Hardby, Elmshire Resources: Silver, electrum, gold, platinum, gems (I-IV), river and road trade nexus Population: Human, Halfling, Gnome, Elf, Dwarf, Half-elf, Half-orc 26 Law: N Allies: Furyondy, Veluna, Verbobonc, Duchy of Urnst, Nyrond, County of Urnst, Dyvers (trade rival), Shield Lands Enemies: The Pomarj, various evil religions Greyhawk is a bustling metropolis where people from all lands and species gather, and trade from across the Flanaess and beyond flows through its streets. Greyhawk was established as a trading post on the Selintan River during the period of the early Great Migrations. The petty noble ruling it became rich and powerful, assuming the title of Landgraf of Selintan, built on trade and silver from the Cairn Hills. Thereafter the Landgraf was wed to the daughter of the Gynarch (Despotrix) of Hardby, a famed sorceress. The city rose to new heights by 375 CY under the rule of Zagig Yragerne (the “Mad Archmage”) who built the sprawling Castle Greyhawk, now a ruin which attracts many adventurers. He built the city to become the self-styled “Gem of the Flanaess”, although his rule became increasingly bizarre before he disappeared mysteriously. Greyhawk declared itself a Free City in 498 CY, recognising the reality it was no longer under the rule of the Overking (whose control has long recededto the distant border with Nyrond). Its lands have waxed and waned over the decades, but are waxing again with a new influx of wealth from treasure brought back by adventurers exploring Castle Greyhawk and the Cairn Hills. Its current domain covers all of the lands from Nyr Dyv to the Neen River where it joins the Selintan, including mines in the Cairn Hills. The Despotrix of Hardby pays tribute to avoid being absorbed by the city. The Lord Mayor rules the Free City, chosen by the Directing Oligarchy of 12 to 18 members. It is composed of the Captain-General of the Watch, the Constable, the Guildmaster of Thieves, the Guildmaster of Assassins, and representatives of the Society of Magi, the Merchants and Traders Union, Artisans League, and various clerical leaders.

Highfolk Proper Name: Free Town of Highfolk; Valley of the Velverdyva (Highvale) Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Mayor Talisyr (appears as an elf - disguised silver dragon)) The Worthy Sir, Loftin Graystand, Mayor of Highfolk Town [N male human]; His Most Excellent Highness, Kashafen Tamarel of Flameflower, Lord of the High Elves of the Vesve (nominal) [CG male elf] Government: Mayor of town is elected by popular vote of household leaders; nonhuman communities are governed by hereditary monarchs from noble families Major Settlements: No capital; Highfolk Resources: Gold, rare woods, gems (I), livestock (sheep, goats), vegetables, wild game, timber Population: Elf, Human, Half-elf, Halfling, Gnome, Dwarf, Half-orc Law: CG Allies: Furyondy, Veluna, Verbobonc, Dyvers, Duchy of Ulek, Knights of the High Forest Enemies: Empire of Iuz, certain denizens of the Vesve Forest Highfolk is the name of both the independent town of that name, and the part of the Valley of the Velverdyva to the north of the town although such is also referred to as the Highvale. The independent town is the southern outpost of the elves of the Quagflow Valley (called the Fairdells in elvish), and a trading center that is home to some 2,000 humans. This well fortified outpost protects the vale to the north, a 100-mile stretch of valley between the southern Yatils and the Vesve Forest. Thorps dot the idyllic dales along the riverbanks, and the Lord of the High Elves (who is a nominal ruler only) dwells there with about 10,000 high elves and numerous sylvan elves (the sylvan elves living mainly amongst the fringes of the Vesve on the east bank of the river). Human woodfolk also dwell here, with hill folk living amongst and allied with the gnomes there. These folk live at peace with those to the north and south, although those seeking adventure sometimes take service with Perrenland mercenary companies. The folk of all species are free spirited and independent, but when threatened will band together for common defence. Whether bandits or raiders from Iuz, invaders face deadly defenders if they dare intrude on these lands. The Knights of the Hart of Highfolk count some of the finest warriors and heroes of the elves in their small number. The arch-mage Mordenkainen is known to be a friend of the free peoples of Highfolk, and protective of them. Further Reading •	Chapter 17 on.

Horned Society Proper Name: The Society of the Dread Hierarchs Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Nine hierarchs (mostly humans and hobgoblins)) Their Dread and Awful Presences, the Hierarchs (true names unknown) Government: Council of 13 hierarchs, ruling over various petty human fiefdoms and bandit leaders, and nonhuman warbands and tribes Major Settlements: Molag Resources: None known Population: Human, Hobgoblin, Orc, Goblin, Half-orc Law: LE Allies: Iuz Enemies: Furyondy, Shield Lands, The Hunting Lands, Bandit Kingdoms (varies) In the aftermath of the disappearance of Iuz in 505 CY his empire quickly broke apart, and this region became a stronghold for several of the more organized nonhuman tribes. In 513 CY a group of human bandit lords took control of Molag, the former “summer capital” of Iuz, and began consolidating the surrounding lands. Hobgoblins, orcs and other nonhumans flocked to their banner, and they established themselves as the Horned Society. The Horned Society soon came into conflict with the Shield Lands, and the Hierarchs swore to take Admundfort. 550 to 570 CY featured regular heavy skirmishing along the Ritensa River, and the Shield Lands building more fortifications. The Horned Society forces combine ranks of nonhuman troops with the organization and powers of humans. The worship of Nerull as well as various devils and fiends is promoted by the leaders, who are reputed to be led by a powerful evil high priest. The other Hierarchs are rumored to be a powerful wizard, powerful priests, a master thief and several powerful warriors. The land between the Veng and Ritensa Rivers north to the Hunting Lands is firmly under their control, and they are said to be on favorable terms with Iuz.

Hunting Lands (Rovers of the Barrens) Proper Name: Arapahai, or People of the Plentiful Huntinglands Ruler: (in DMG 2014 - Overlord-Protector Yhareen Sakarr (tiefling)) His Mighty Lordship, the Ataman of the Standards, Kishwa Dogteeth; Chief of the Wardogs [CN male human] Government: Four loosely allied clans, each composed of several nomadic tribes; each tribe led by a chieftain elected for fighting ability and leadership; best warriors join the Wardogs (not aligned with any tribe), and the best warrior of the Wardogs has limited authority over all tribal chiefs Major Settlements: No capital; no cities, only temporary camps of up to 5000 Resources: Furs and hides, horn, gold, horses Population: Human, Orc, Goblin, Hobgoblin, Halfling, Gnome, Half-orc Law: CN Allies: Elves of the Fellreev, centaurs of Fellreev and Barrens, Wolf Nomads (humans), Iuz (orcs) Enemies: Stonehold, Bandit Kingdoms, Iuz (humans); Elves of the Fellreev, centaurs of Fellreev and Barrens (orcs) The Arapahai are nomadic Flan people and their homeland is aptly named - the tribes endure harsh winters and dry summers, scraping what little they can from the poor land to survive. They are referred to by outsiders as the Rovers of the Barrens, as they have no permanent settlements, and their lands seem bleak and barren. These hardy nomads were content to herd, hunt and stage the occasional raid on Furyondy, the Bandit Kingdoms and Tenh. Their territory was historically the lands north of the Fellreev Forest, between the Opicm River and the western end of the Griff Mountains and Bluff Hills, This remained the case until about 320 CY when the Relentless Horde invaded from the west. Initially mismatched, they learned from the Baklunish invaders and in time drove them from their lands. 28 Later, the growth of the Bandit Kingdoms, Iuz and then the Horned Society reduced the range and territory of the tribes. The Battle of Opicm River is 515 CY saw the tribes gather to war upon a combined host of the leaderless forces of Iuz and the newly emerged Horned Society. The Arapahai were decimated and scattered, with many chieftains killed. Only a remnant of the tribes remains in the area from the Wastes to the Forlorn Forest. The Arapahai warriors include the Wardogs, swift runners famed for their endurance. They are masters of close combat who favor the hatchet and knife, although some specialize in the lariat. They are legendary for their boldness and agility, and ability to hamstring opposing cavalry. Their reputation is the source of the saying used through the Flanaess, of “wild as a Wardog.” Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. “Protection circles, plus news of the north central Flanaess” - Dragon Magazine #56.

Idee Proper Name: County of Idee Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Count Vasiliek Donstan (human)) His Brilliant Lordship, Fedorik Eddri of Idee [NG human male] Government: Hereditary feudal monarchy Major Settlements: Naerie Resources: Foodstuffs, copper, gold Population: Human, Halfling, Elf, Gnome, Dwarf, Half-elf Law: N Allies: Iron Hills, Onnwal, Sunndi, Nyrond, Irongate, Almor, Lordship of the Isles Enemies: Ahlissa, Great Kingdom Idee was amongst those lands conquered in the early years of the Kingdom of Aerdy. It has many communities of elves, dwarves, gnomes and halflings that have long lived in peace with humans, and fought together against common enemies. When Ivid I ascended the throne in 446 CY after the Turmoil Between Crowns, Idee was amongst those that rose in rebellion in the South Province against the Overking. It formed the Iron League, an alliance with Onnwal, Irongate, the Lordship of the Isles and later Sunndi, to stand against the Great Kingdom supported by Nyrond. The alliance continues to this day. The realm maintains a chain of castles and fortresses that guards the northern frontier against Ahlissan forces, manned by a standing army. The Count also has militia ready to muster when required. The County has strong trade links across the sea to both Onnwal and Nyrond. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. “Developments from Stonefist to South Province”. Dragon Magazine #57. TSR 1982. Irongate Proper Name: Free City of Irongate Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Mayor Unthera Selvich (appears as a dwarf)) His Resolute Honor, Cobb Darg, Lord High Mayor of Irongate [LG male human] Government: Lord mayor elected by city council for a ten-year term; city council made up of old nobles, merchants, clerics, military heads Major Settlements: Irongate Resources: Gems (II, III), iron ore Population: Human, Dwarf, Halfling Law: LN Allies: Iron Hills, Onnwal, Sunndi, Nyrond Enemies: Scarlet Brotherhood, Ahlissa Long a cosmopolitan trade city, the surrounding hills provide little land for crops but are rich in minerals and gems. It was built by the Great Kingdom to provide a strong presence on the Azure Sea. An alliance with the dwarves of the Iron Hills, along with the rich iron deposits in the hills, resulted in what became known as the Overking’s Armory. The city became more independent under the rule of House Rax as Overking, but supported it during the Turmoil Between Crowns. As Ivid became more tyrannical, the independent minded city became more unsettled. In 446 CY the Lord Mayor led a delegation raising grievances with the Herzog of Ahlissa. The delegation was imprisoned, given a show trial, and executed by ritual torture. The south rose in revolt, and the Iron League alliance was founded by Irongate, Onnwal, Idee and the Lordship of the Isles to resist the Great Kingdom. The city-state is famed for its massive, heavily fortified walls. Due to its strategic location and a siege mentality ingrained in its people, the city maintains a large, well- trained standing army and navy. An island citadel guards the bay, and a series of interlocking gates controls access by water. Named for its high-quality iron ore, mining, and metalwork, the city’s weaponsmiths are widely regarded as the finest in the Flanaess. There are rumors that Mayor Darg may be more than he seems – perhaps not even human or truly humanoid. However, no one has ever openly challenged him on the matter. Others mutter these rumors are spread by the city’s enemies to undermine their long- term leader. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. “Developments from Stonefist to South Province”. Dragon Magazine #57.

In the late 5th century CY a warlord emerged amongst the warring bandits and nonhuman tribes of the north that had succeeded the petty barons under the rule of the Great Kingdom. By 500 CY it had become clear this was no petty brigand writ large, but a cruel and powerful tyrant with demonic origins and powers. He brought the western part of the Bandit Kingdoms under his control, and nonhuman tribes flocked to the banner of Iuz. Surrounding realms prepared to defend against his expansion, although Furyondy fell to politicking about same. Just as war seemed inevitable, Iuz disappeared in 505 CY. His generals, priests and war bands fell to fighting each other again, although the Horned Society emerged from amongst them. In his absence, his cult still flourished, and the orc tribes took to calling him the Old One, but the surrounding realms breathed a sigh of relief. In 570 CY Iuz reappeared. He had been trapped beneath Castle Greyhawk by a trick of the infamous arch mage Zagyg, and escaped when the arch mage Tenser, Lord Robilar and a band of adventurers had attempted to release and kill him. He swore revenge on them all, and set to reestablish his empire in the north. Now surrounding lands look at the return of Iuz with trepidation, fearing he means to resume what he started over 70 years ago.

Keoland Proper Name: Kingdom of Keoland Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - King Kimbertos Skotti (human)) His Peerless Majesty, the King of Keoland, Kimbertos Skotti (LG male human) Government: Aristocratic federation with elective monarchy Major Settlements: Niole Dra; Cryllor, Flen, Gradsul Resources: Foodstuffs, cloth, gold, gems (III) Population: Human, Elf, Gnome, Halfling, Half-elf, Dwarf Law: NG Allies: Bissel, Gran March, Geoff, Sterich, Ulek states Enemies: Celene (distrusted), Ket (distrusted), Sea Princes (distrusted) The Kingdom of Keoland is the oldest human nation of the Flanaess, having been founded by Oeridians and Suel 80 years after the Twin Cataclysms. The kings slowly expanded the realm through diplomacy and limited conquest to include the entire Sheldomar Valley and several regions beyond, including Bissel, the Pomarj, and a portion of the Wild Coast. They also allied with the normally reclusive rulers of Celene. Two kings undertook a series of conquests in Ket and Veluna, which ended in defeat with the loss of the outlying provinces and the end of the alliance with Celene. Since then, the kings have engaged in cautious diplomacy intended to recover the lost portions of the realm. Keoland is composed of aristocratic states that meet in Court to negotiate and decide matters of national importance. The king is traditionally elected from one of two Suel noble houses. While the Court of the Land heavily constrains the power of the king, a monarch who is capable of navigating the tangled politics of the land can wield significant power. Although a human land, the kingdom has a significant dwarf, elf, gnome, and halfling 30 population, with dwarf, elf, and gnome member states and representatives in the Court.

The nation is renowned for being the crossroads of trade between the western and eastern Flanaess. Merchants hold much power here, trading with neighboring states even in times of peace or war. Indeed, for many decades Ket has either invaded or been invaded further adding to its cultural diversity. While predominantly a Baklunish state, the court of the Beygraf shows influences from many nations. Dwarven and halfling populations in Ket are highly regarded for their skills. Nearly any species or nationality can be encountered in heavily populated regions like Lopolla and Molvar.

Lordship of the Isles Proper Name: The Lordship of the Isles Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Princess Ronthal III (human)) His Exalted Highness, Prince Latmac Ranold of Duxchan; Lord of the Isles; Scourge of the Waves [CN male human] Government: Principality, ruling various petty duchies, counties and baronies Major Settlements: Sulward; Duxchan Resources: Rare woods, spices, shipbuilding supplies Population: Human, Elf, Halfling, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-elf, Half-orc Law: LN Allies: Nyrond, Onnwal, Irongate, Idee, Sunndi Enemies: Great Kingdom, Rel Astra, Sea Baronies, Ahlissa, Aerdiaak, Medegia The Suel settled these islands a thousand years ago during the Great Migrations, joining the Flan already there. When the Oeridians settled the Solnor Coast and established the Kingdom of Aerdy, these islands remained a powerful naval force raiding the south coast and controlling the seas. Eventually the Great Kingdom turned its attention to them in 166 CY, and subjugated them in a campaign of several years climaxing in the Battle of Ganode Bay. After the south of the Great Kingdom erupted in rebellion, the Lordship joined the Iron League alliance in 448 CY providing naval power and shipping to its allies. The Sea Baronies and the Lordship have fought a bitter battle for control of the seas since. The principality covers seven major islands stretching from the Spindrift Sound in the north to the mouth of the Tilva Strait in the south. These islands are covered by thick tropical forests surrounding rocky, volcanic peaks, providing rich and fertile soil for sugarcane, pineapple, and coffee plantations. Exotic plant and animal life abound in the forests, and the peaks are mineral rich. The islands sit on a crucial and profitable trade route bringing goods from Hepmonaland to the Great Kingdom, and also collect levies from merchant ships using the Tilva Strait. The Duxchaners have given up their previous trade in piracy for these more profitable pursuits. Olman from northern Hepmonaland, and even some Touv from further south of that island continent, can be found here. There is long standing rivalry between the Lordship of the Isles and the Sea Baronies. This is further inflamed by the recent victory by the Sea Baronies at the Battle of Medegia in 572 CY, when four warships were sunk and three loaded cogs taken as prizes before they could make Pontylver.

Per previous published sources the Holy Censor is a high priest of Hextor, and it is the Overking that has fiendish pacts. The map also notes Pontylver as capital, when Mentrey was previously the capital in published sources. The Overking has granted the Holy Censor all lands south of the Mikar River between Rel Astra and Pontylver. In return, Spidasa continues to swear fealty to the Great Kingdom, providing information and intelligence about the forces and influence of other leaders in the region. This fealty is arguably a token gesture, as the Holy Censor spends much of his time expounding the virtues of Hextor and appealing to his people to continue their worship of the Scourge of Battle. The capital city, Pontylver, is a busy trading port located at the mouth of the Flanmi River, which marks the official western edge of Medegia. The land of Medegia proper consists of fertile rolling plains, providing Medegia with an abundance of food. The cropland also provides enough fibrous plant species for Medegia to become known as a producer and exporter of textiles (cloth). His Equitable Nemesis rules with an iron fist, and much of the population remains poor despite the high food and cloth production. The Holy Censor seeks to increase his land holdings and has recently sent mercenary bands into the Hestmark Highlands, Hestmark Peaks, and Grandwood to explore, overtake, and claim more territory under the banner of Medegia. Some attempts to wrangle lands from the gnomes and dwarves in the Hestmarks have been successful, as have efforts to wrest lands from the elves in the deeper Grandwood. Limited success has been found in skirmishes north across the Mikar River into Nulbish and Torrich, and forces have pushed further north along the Thelly River to overtake civilized areas there. The Holy Censor has even claimed dominion over some Ahlissan territory near Hexpools, but that is disputed by the Herzog. These incursions, and numerous others, have filled the coffers of Medegian nobles and high-ranking clergy, allowing them to grow wealthy even as the general population experiences widespread poverty.

Nyrond Proper Name: Kingdom of Nyrond Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - King Dunstan I (human)) His August Supremacy, Altmeister of All the Aerdi, King Archbold III [LG male human] Government: Hereditary feudal monarchy Major Settlements: Rel Mord; Beetu, Borneven, Curtulenn, Hammensend, Hendrenn Halgood, Midmeadow, Mithat, Mowbrenn, Oldred, Womtham, Woodwych, Wragby Resources: Foodstuffs, cloth, copper, silver, gems (I, II) Population: Human, Elf, Halfling, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-elf, Half-orc Law: LN Allies: Duchy of Urnst, County of Urnst, Greyhawk, Idee, Onnwal, Iron Hills, Irongate, Lordship of the Isles, Sunndi, Tenh, Theocracy of the Pale (strained) Enemies: Empire of Iuz, Bandit Kingdoms, Great Kingdom, Aerdiaak, Ahlissa, Bone March NOTE: The DMG 2024 indicates the Bone March was recently occupied by Nyrond and Almor. In published sources the March has been occupied by nonhuman tribes since 563 CY, although Knurl was recently taken by Nyrond-Almor forces. Further, it is indicated the Gamboge Forest and Flinty Hills are inhabited by several independent communities with no great love for Nyrond or the Pale. Previous published sources detailed those were allied with Nyrond, with parts of the Flinty Hills within Nyrond and eastern parts supported by it in battles with nonhuman tribes of the Bone March. Since its secession from the Great Kingdom in 356 CY, Nyrond has steadfastly served as a bulwark for the western Flanaess against the malevolence of the Aerdy rump and its fiend-seeing Overkings. It is a prosperous nation under the leadership of King Archbold, whose commitment to his people remains steadfast as he approaches his twilight years, and it is renowned as a bastion of learning, culture and scholarship. The kingdom faces threats on many fronts, yet it is steadfast in supporting its allies. It aids the Urnst states against the Bandit Kingdoms, and its navy patrols the Relmor Bay and Sea of Gearnat supporting the Iron League against Aerdy ships. Almor is an important ally and buffer 32 against the Great Kingdom - combined Nyrondese and Almorian forces have advanced into the lower Bone March and successfully captured Knurl.

Onnwal Proper Name: Free State of Onnwal Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - The Raven of Onnwal, Zyl Grayshadow (dwarf)) His Noble Authority, Ewerd Destron, the Szek of Free Onnwal [LN male human] Government: Hereditary feudal monarchy Major Settlements: Scant; Kildeer, Bergardsbridge, Longbridge, Sornhill Provinces: 24 lairdships and village mayors Resources: Platinum, gems (III, includes pearls) Population: Human, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Elf Law: LN Allies: Dwarves of the Headlands, Idee, Irongate, Iron Hills, Lordship of the Isles, Sunndi, Nyrond, Duchy of Urnst, Greyhawk Enemies: The Pomarj. Great Kingdom After the Dragonshead peninsula was conquered by the Aerdi General Azharadin, it became part of the South Province (Ahlissa). The first Herzog divided it into four provinces, each governed by one of Azharadian’s most loyal captains (whose descendants still rule to this day) and appointed an overlord, or Szek, to oversee the entire territory. Onnwal seceded from the South Province when its nobles overthrew the Herzog’s appointed Szek and installed one of their own in his place in 447 CY. With the Headlands and Irongate providing excellent defences on land it is a strong, free state that provides key naval support to the alliance. Today Szek Ewerd Destron rules with a just yet firm hand from the palace in Scant, a city famed for its impregnable defenses. Onnwal’s vessels reach as far west as the Hold of the Sea Princes and as far east as Dullstrand. Yet all is not well - Onnwal must stand ever vigilant against the raids of Herzog Chelor. The Duke of Sornhill has secretly resorted to selling the town’s dregs to slavers to finance the costly elixirs needed to sustain his ailing daughter. Conversely the Wreckers, the infamous thieves’ guild of Scant, has recently come under the leadership of Rakehell Chert, who is gradually reforming the group, reducing its bloodthirsty ways and curbing the violent wrecking that gave the gang its name. A vast network of caverns lies beneath Scant, and among those who suspect their existence and significance is the arch mage Bigby, who maintains both a tower in the city and a modest residence in Halmarn, a suburb of Scant, under the alias of Fraznier.

These are harsh and cold lands, where food is scarce, but there is an abundance of mineral wealth, thus the Theocracy is affluent and its citizens have a standard of living that would be the envy of the rest of the Flanaess. Yet personal freedoms are a far second to the rule of religious law. The Church-Militant’s armies are splendid, with the Knights Templar of Pholtus being particularly renowned. Other faiths, arcane magicians and heresies are brutally suppressed. The Palish turn their backs on nearby good nations such as Nyrond, denouncing 33 34 them the same fiery zeal they hurl at the Fiend-Seeing Overking or Iuz the Old One (though this does not prevent them trading with the Urnst States and Nyrond for food). Theocrat Ogon Tillit sits upon the Throne of the Sun in the hallowed Basilica of Wintershiven, guided by the Council of Nine — the prelates of the nine cities of the Pale. Though political intrigue and internal strife simmer within the council, the Church-Militant and the Knights Templar stand unwavering in their loyalty to the Theocrat and all are eager to expand the Theocracy’s borders and bring the salvation of Pholtus to heathens. In the rural reaches hidden shrines to nature gods and spirits exist, but those who worship these forbidden deities are right to be fearful of being to the Question by the Church-Militant - “Cold weather is Pholtus’s way of telling you to throw another heretic on the fire” is more than just a saying.

Perrenland Proper Name: Concatenated Cantons of Perrenland Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Voorzitter Yrenda Schwartzen (human)) His Gravity, Granz, Voormann of all Perrenland [LN male human] Government: Independent parliamentary republic in which the collective feudal clan leaders (Cantonal Council, which handles legislative matters) elects an executive leader (Voormann) for an eight-year term to conduct affairs such as diplomacy and command military; cantons have varying methods of internal government; family heads are allowed to elect mayors of local cities and towns, but clan leader positions are hereditary Major Settlements: Schwartzenbruin; Krestible, Traft Resources: Copper, foodstuffs (fish, dairy); resources scarce, not exported Population: Orc, Human, Hobgoblin, Halfling, Gnome, Half-elf, Half-orc Law: LN Allies: No real allies, only trading partners Enemies: Knights of the Hart, Chakyik (Tiger Nomads), Empire of Iuz (distrusted) The most warlike of the Flan tribes in the Flanaess were those of the Yatil Mountains, and the invading Oerids, Suel and even some Baklunish were absorbed by their clans. However, the Great Kingdom was able to overwhelm them by about 100 CY and establish rule there. Rebellions were endemic, and locals learned from their military service with Ferrond and then Furyondy when it severed. When the Relentless Horde rampaged across the north in about 320 CY, the Perrenlanders used the opportunity to break free. Incursions by Furyondy then Ket, and by various nomads, were repelled and their strongest leader Perren drew the various clans into a loose association under his banner by about 400 CY. The clans of the lands were organized into cantonments, and each leader (hetmen, voormanns, etc) elected a leader with limited powers to rule for an eight year period, and provide advice. The arch mage Iggilwiv conquered Perrenland from her stronghold in the Yatils for a decade from 481 CY. Her evil reign was thrown off when the demon prince she had enslaved brought her low, and her nonhuman legions were destroyed. Perrenland has prospered through trade with Furyondy, Veluna, the Baklunish states and the northern nomads. The chief export is well-trained mercenary bands. High elves control the valley of the Quagflow River below the Clatspur Range, but can be found in service with these mercenaries as scouts and light infantry. Perrenlander mercenaries have been employed by Furyondy, Veluna, Bissel, and even Ket against Tusmit. Perrenland maintains strong borders and has militia ready to answer a call to arms. Warships control Lake Quag and escort merchant barges and cogs. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. S4 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth. TSR 1982. •	Gary Gygax. WG4 The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun.

These nomadic tribes roam in seasonal cycles between the plains and the semi-arid Dry Steppes to the south. They are best known for herding and training horses, indeed the tribes are often sought as mercenary cavalry by the bordering Baklunish states. Besides intertribal feuding, the main enemy of the Ulakandar are their warlike cousins in the land of Ull. 35 Collectively the Ulakandar are the descendants of the fallen Baklunish Empire. While their tribes share the same language, customs and superstitions, there is no central authority among the nomads whose leaders hold a variety of titles. The Ulakandar share the vast plains with several nomadic centaur clans who follow the same seasonal patterns. Further Reading •	David ‘Zeb’ Cook. WGA4 Vecna Lives! TSR 1990.

Before Keoland’s northern expansion it was subdued and made a part of the Principality of Ulek. When the principality declared independence from Keoland, the human nobles of the Pomarj declared independence in turn. This was short-lived, as orcs and goblins invaded the region following the Hateful Wars. The land has been a ruined mess of warring tribes and petty holdings ever since. The people of the Pomarj were a Flan-Suel mix with minor Oerid admixture, similar to those of the Wild Coast. Since the invasion, many of the inhabitants have acquired orc and goblin heritage.

The military commander, General Sir Pelgrave Ratik of Winetha, established good relations with the local dwarves, and was capable and just. The local pines were desirable for shipbuilding, and he began sending back timber, tribute and reports of driving out the last of the Fruztii in the area. When a raiding fleet was driven off, the Overking ennobled the commander as Baron Ratik and his descendants ruled the fief since. The Barony has prospered since. In the 550s CY when nonhuman raiders began raiding from the mountains, Ratik’s dwarven allies warned of the looming threat. Human and gnome companies moved to 36 defend the raids while the Barony was alerted, and resistance was so fierce the raiders moved onto the Bone March instead. When it fell in 563 CY, it left Ratik to be ruled as a fief palatine since. While Ratik can defend itself, it lacks the forces to drive out the occupiers of the Bone March. Since the fall of the Bone March, Archbaron Lexnol III has build an alliance with the Fruztii tribes to resist the forces of Aerdiaak, the Bone March and Stonehold.

Rel Astra Proper Name: The Free and Independent Aerdi City of Rel Astra Ruler:(in DMG 2024 - Constable Mayor Drax (orc)) His Most Lordly Nobility Drax the Constable Mayor of Rel Astra [LE male human] Government: Palatinate principality Major Settlements: Rel Astra; Ountsy Resources: Shipbuilding supplies, fish, lumber Population: Human, Halfling, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-orc, Half-elf Law: LE Allies: Sea Barons, Great Kingdom, North Province, Medegia, Ahlissa (all political rivals) Enemies: Free Folk of the Grandwood, Dwarves and Gnomes of the Hestmark, Sunndi, Lordship of the Isles Rel Astra, “the City of the Heavens”, is a vast city, being the first of the great Aerdi settlements and once serving as the capital of the Great Kingdom. Its Old City families, pure and inbred Oeridians, to this day cling to archaic customs and language. After the capital was moved to Rauxes, the city’s governance was entrusted to Constable Mayors— royal appointees drawn exclusively from House Garasteth. During the Turmoils Between Crowns, the Garasteth Princes of Rel Astra switched allegiances upon witnessing Ivid I’s Fiend-Seeing Throne at the city’s gates. However, this perfidy earned Rel Astra’s semi-independence and it is now a palatine state controlling a significant area of surrounding land. This is a harsh and unyielding city, well-defended with the morale of its people strong, ironically in part due to its current Constable-Mayor’s iron-fisted rule. The wily Drax has ruled Rel Astra for over a generation now, and the populace have taken to the virtues of thrift, caution, hard work and self-sacrifice that he extols. Drax is no toadying ally to the Overking, and seeks closer ties with the Censor of Medegia and the Admiral of the Sea Baronies to keep in check the power of the Naelax. Like the rest of the Great Kingdom, Rel Astra has succumbed to wickedness, though its descent has been masked by a facade of civility. Drax openly holds the council of the Fiend-Sage, a molydeus demon who affects the demeanor of a genteel scholar, high in esteem. The people of Rel Astra in turn describe themselves as fiercely pragmatic traditionalists, but this can include the worship of dark powers such as Hextor, Wee Jas, and Erthynul. Outsiders are largely limited to the Foreign Quarter of the city, but the ancient inner-city features eclectic and archaic architecture, with many ancient houses said to be haunted, strange esoteric shops, and the great Sorcerer’s Nexus - a renowned school of magery.

Schnai (Snow Barbarians) Proper Name: Northern Kingdom of the Schnai Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Queen Ingrid of the Schnai (human)) His Bellicose Majesty, King Orvung of the Schnai [CN male human] Government: Independent feudal monarchy with hereditary rulership, loosely governing powerful jars; jars meet yearly at the Assembly of Knudje (without king present), then send representatives to Soull to negotiate with king or have him resolve judicial dispute, king and jarls each have a retinue of advisors (priests and skalds) Major Settlements: Soull; Knudje 37 Resources: Copper, gems (I, II) Population: Human, Dwarf, Halfling, Elf, Gnome, Half-elf, Half-orc Law: CN Allies: Cruski (sometimes), Fruztii (sometimes), Ratik (sometimes) Enemies: Empire of Iuz, evil humanoids and giants in the Corusk Mountains, Aerdiaak, Sea Baronies, Bone March, Stonehold, Fruztii (sometimes), Ratik (sometimes), Cruski (sometimes) The most powerful of the northern barbarian nations, the Schnai trade with fellow barbarians and join them in raids against the southerners of the Great Kingdom and Sea Baronies. Of all the northern barbarians, the Schnai have the best sailors and are welcome on any expedition. The Schnai regularly fight invading nonhumans from the mountains, but have sufficient warriors to still participate in southern raids each season. They have held the coast south of Glot for several decades, although their control over the Fruztii has weakened substantially to the point of being in oath only. There are rumors Ratik has proposed alliance with all the Rhizian tribes to take the Hold of Stonefist and the Bone March. The Schnai are watching the efforts of the current Fruztii-Ratik alliance.

Sea Baronies Proper Name: Dominions of the Sea Barons Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - four barons including High Admiral Kalashe Asperdi (human)) His Noble Prominence, Sencho Foy, the Lord High Admiral of Asperdi; Commander of the Sea Barons [CN human male] Government: Independent feudal monarchy with hereditary leadership; a different noble family governs each island, but all owe fealty to Asperdi Major Settlements: Asperdi; Ironport, Oakenheart, Port Elder, Vernport Resources: Seafaring technology and knowledge, shipbuilding supplies Population: Human, Halfling, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-elf, Half-orc Law: CN Allies: Great Kingdom, Rel Astra, Aerdiaak, Medegia, Ahlissa (all political rivals) Enemies: Lordship of the Isles, Fruztii, Schnai, Cruski, Ratik The territory of Sea Baronies includes Asperdi Isle, Oakisle, and Fairisle, all three of which are in the Solnor Ocean east of the Gull Cliffs. Two other isles, Leastisle and the Isle of Serpents, are also part of the baronies. Leastisle is a long, narrow island located just south of the main three, and east of Ountsy. Some miles south, just east of Rel Astra, is the small Isle of Serpents, a plateau of lush green jungle atop high cliffs. The four major islands are fertile and provide many ship building and food resources to the people there, while the Isle of Serpents is abandoned and dangerous - rumored to have thousands of poisonous asps as its main occupants. The Sea Baronies excel at shipbuilding and naval warfare, maintaining a formidable fleet that sails under commission of the Overking, simultaneously flying their own baronial flags and that of the Great Kingdom. The four barons who rule the main islands (there is no baron on the Isle of Serpents) control their own minor fiefs, but trade and cooperation with each other allows them to maintain naval superiority and enjoy growing prosperity. Patrolling squadrons are sent to protect the entire eastern and southern coastlines of the territories of the Great Kingdom, from as far north as Bellport all the way south and west to Pontylver. They often skirmish with forces of the Fruzti, Schnai, and Cruski, as those three groups sail south to loot and plunder areas protected by the Overking. Ships of the Duxchaners, who control the waters surrounding the Lordship of the Isles, also frequently clash with Sea Baronies’ patrols in Spindrift Sound and the Aerdi Sea. Independent merchant ships, and those commissioned by neutral parties, often give the ships of the Sea Baronies a wide berth since they carry letters of marque from the Overking, and only the foolish would willingly turn the eye of the Malachite Throne toward them.

Sea Princes Proper Name: Hold of the Sea Princes Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Prince Zygmund III of Monmurg (human)) His Royal Highness, Prince Jeon II of Monmurg; Ruler of the Azure Sea, Captain of all Fleets Government: Independent federation of aristocratic nobles Major Settlements: Monmurg; Hokar, Port Toli Resources: Foodstuffs Population: Human, Halfling, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-elf, Half-orc 38 Law: CN Allies: None Enemies: Keoland, Yeomanry In the first centuries after the Twin Cataclysms the region of the Sea Princes was a rival to Keoland. Subdued before the northern conquests, it became an extension of the southern royal family. This led to its rebellion during the northern conquests, a secret civil war that split that family, and ended with the independence of the Sea Princes. In the 150 years since then it has remained a rival, though in trade rather than in raiding and privateering. The Sea Princes have one fault – they permit slavery, raiding the Amedio Jungle and taking the natives back to work their plantations. This is the cause of their rivalry with the Yeomanry, as the freeholders of that state find the practice abominable, and only the vast Hool Marsh prevents open war between the two countries. The people of the Hold are predominantly Flan-Suel with minor Oeridian admixture. The Flan heritage is distinct from the Flan of Keoland proper, while the Suel heritage is split between relatives of the southern royal family of Keoland and their old rivals from before the area was subdued.

Shar (Scarlet Brotherhood) Proper Name: Great and Hidden Empire of Shar Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Father of Obedience Korenth Zan (human?)) His Peerless Serenity, the Father of Obedience Korenth Zan [LE male human] Government: Homelands appear to be governed by feudal plantation lords, who in turn are managed by ever-present red-robed monks Major Settlements: Hesuel llshar; Ekul, Kro Terlep Resources: Rare woods, fruits, spices, gold, gems (I, III, IV) Population: Human Law: LE Allies: Spies and assassins placed covertly in courts throughout the Flanaess. Enemies: All other nations of the Flanaess (secretly) This militant society of Suel supremacists inhabits the secluded cities of the Tilvanot Peninsula in the south. Their secret agenda is to dominate the entirety of the Flanaess under their control, and they embrace ruthless means to fulfil their destiny. Members are called Brothers and Sisters, while higher-ranking individuals in the rigid hierarchy are referred to as Elder Brothers or Sisters. The Scarlet Order’s chief weapons in the days to come will be stealth and assassination, for they have seeded spies and assassins in many of the courts of Flanaess, patiently waiting for the right moment to strike and fulfil the destiny of the Suel. The leaders of the Brotherhood are monks who live ascetic lives in cloisters, upholding a rigid physical discipline and led by Korenth Zan, the Father of Obedience. The Order has explored Hepmonaland and the Amedio Jungle, where they have liberated many treasures and recruited armies from the local tribes folk. They maintain extensive breeding programs, with the Father of Obedience sanctioning all unions between the membership and eager to spawn unique and terrible monsters to unleash upon the Flanaess.

When Ferrond seceded from the Great Kingdom in 254 CY the various minor nobles on the Nyr Dyv’s north shore refused to acknowledge the rule of the new king of Furyondy. However, the rule of the failing Overking was also not to their liking, and they essentially became independent petty baronies still loyal to the concept and principles of the original Aerdy. As the Bandit Kingdoms grew in power these two dozen or so petty nobles to the north of the Nyr Dyv formed an alliance for defense. The Earl or Walworth was chosen as Knight Commander of the combined forces of the alliance, as his small Earldom included a sizable island on which was built the only city in the whole area. A religious order, the Knights of Holy Shielding, was established with its headquarters at Admundfort. Various minor nobles continue to rule the various parts of the Shield Lands, and the Earl of Walworth continues to inherit the position of general of the military forces. Furyondy and Urnst contribute to support the military forces, and numerous squires and knights enlist for service in the Knights of Holy Shielding. The Shield Lands have the most modern and best maintained roadways in the Flanaess, to aid in their defence and military forces moving about as needed. The Shield Lands currently face the growing threat of the Horned Society in the north, along with the return of Iuz, in addition to the ongoing menace of the Bandit Kingdoms. Spindrift Isles (Lendore Isles) Proper Name: North Isles - Unknown; Lendore Isle Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - The Council of Five (on the northern islands) and the Council of Seven (on the southern island)) North Isles - The Council of Five (true names unknown); Lendore Isle - The Council of Seven Government: North Isles - Independent Council, unknown membership with unknown succession rules; Lendore Isle - Independent council of appointed members Major Settlements: North Isles - Unknown; Lendore Isle - Lo Reltarma; Pel Reltarma, Garrotten, Restenford, Kroten, North Landing Resources: unknown Population: North Isles - Elf (high, grey), half-elf; Lendore – Human, Elf (high, grey), Half-elf Law: CG (North Isles); NG (Lendore Isle) Allies: Trading partners Enemies: Pirates Roughly 350 miles to the East of the coast of Medegia, across the Spindrift Sound, a small grouping of islands can be found. These islands, collectively known as the Sprindrift Isles, are divided into two regions. The four northern isles are led by the Council of Seven, and inhabited by Olvenfolk (High Elves and Grey Elves) who tend to be rather insular in their dealings. The Council is rumored to be made up of elven wizards supported by various elven lords and half-elven clergy. The people there are self-sufficient and keep to themselves, neither allowing 40 free trade nor profiting from it. Rumors of elves capturing and imprisoning the crew of any non-elven ship that touches its shores are rampant and mostly unsubstantiated. They do, however, provide an incentive for most ships to avoid the northern islands in the Spindrift Sound. Little is known of the religious habits and beliefs of the people on the northern isles Lendore Isle is the official name of the large southern island, governed by the Council of Seven. It enjoys the profits of a healthy open trade policy, including contracts with the Sea Baronies as well as the Lordship of the Isles. The Council meets in the capital, Lo Reltarma, located on a small islet just south of Lenore Isle proper. It is more liberal than their northern counterparts, and they welcome interaction with representatives from many realms. Though trading to and from the island is open, the contracts stipulate that piracy is not allowed and the punishment for such is swift and deadly. Lendore Isle has a mixed population of elves and humans, and a few other common species. The majority of humans are of Suel ancestry. Most of the non-olven population recognize and respect the Suel pantheon, often specifically focusing on Lendor, Llerg, Phaulkon, Phyton, Syrul, and Wee Jas. The elven population tends to admire Sehanine Moonbow above all others. Lendore Isle has a variety of open temples and areas of worship. The island also features a number of tribes of orcs and kobolds inhabiting the wilderness areas. Further Reading •	Lenard Lakofka. L1 The Secret of Bone Hill. TSR 1981; L2 The Assassin’s Knot.

Sterich Proper Name: Earldom of Sterich (in DMG 2024 - The March of Sterich) Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Marquise Quercha Emondrav (human)) His Magnitude, Querchard, Earl of Sterich [LN human male] Government: Feudal monarchy owing fealty to Keoland Major Settlements: Istivin Resources: Silver, electrum, gold, gems (II-III) Population: Human, Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, Elf, Half-elf, Half- orc Law: LN Allies: Bissel, Gran March, Geoff, Keoland, Ulek states Enemies: None organized, giants and humanoids in the mountains Sterich was the first land beyond the Javan River added to Keoland, established to provide easier access to the mines of the mountains. Its rulers are distant relatives of the king as well as of the grand duke of Geoff. The petty nobles here grew rich, assisted by good relations with the clans of mountain dwarves in the Crystalmists. Aside from raids by the giants of the mountains, it is a peaceful backwater barely active in the intrigues of the court and content to keep to itself. The people of Sterich show strong Flan influences on the Oeridian-Suel mix of Keoland, though not as great as in Geoff. They have a strong relation with the dwarves and gnomes of the surrounding mountains, and the land is quite wealthy despite its minor political status. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax.

Stonefist (Stonehold) Proper Name: The Hold of Stonefist Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - King Sevvord Redbeard of the Hold (human)) His Most Grim and Terrible Might, Rhelt Sevvord I, Master of Stonehold (CE male human) Government: Independent feudal monarchy with hereditary rulership, governing four ataman nobles (ruling from the towns) and four nomadic tribal chieftains, with the standing army commanded by the rhelt (king); current rhelt is charismatic and has near-dictatorial powers Major Settlements: Vlekstaad Resources: Furs, walrus ivory, silver, gems (I) Population: Human, Orc, Dwarf Law: CE Allies: None Enemies: Empire of Iuz, Fruztii, Crusti, Schnai, Ratik, Theocracy of the Pale, denizens of the Griffs Stonehold is one of the harshest regions in all the Flanaess, with its frigid climate and brutal regime. Brute strength and treachery are its chief assets, and all of its neighbors are considered enemies. Vlek Col Vlekzed was banished from his tribe in the Hunting Lands for bandits and lying. A few warriors and their families followed their leader; and for several years they wandered the fringes of their lands raiding and stealing. More outcasts and bandits joined them, and he then raided into Tenh and the Bandit Kingdoms gaining recruits, before he defeated a force from Tenh hunting him down. After defeating a bandit leader and enslaving his followers, Vled then established a fortified settlement beyond White Fanged Bay in about 430 CY Here he deceived, then slaughtered or drove off, the Coltens Feodality and took over their lands, attracting more 41 malcontents to his banner. He was named Stonefist for his reputation as a fearsome enemy and inflexible ruler. Rulership of the Hold is semi-hereditary, with the title having to be won by a rite of challenge. Lesser titles and positions are also allocated by success in the bi-annual “Rite of Battle Fitness”. Murder among the leadership is common, and assassination is an accepted form of negotiation. Only some of the inhabitants of the lands reside in permanent settlements, with the rest living a semi-nomadic life on the tundra in summer and migrating south in the autumn. The war bands of the Hold sally forth in raids against the Fruztii, Tenh, and even the Hunting Lands. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. “Sorcerer’s Scroll: Developments from Stonefist to South Province”.

Sunndi Proper Name: County of Sunndi Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Steward Valenta (elf)) Count Hazendel of Sunndi [CG male elf] Government: Independent feudal monarchy with a gray-elf royal family governing numerous noble houses of humans and nonhumans; member of the Iron League Major Settlements: Pitchfield; Newkeep Resources: Electrum, platinum, gems (II, IV) Population: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling Law: NG Allies: Idee, Irongate, Lordship of the Isles, Onnwal, Nyrond, Almor Enemies: Great Kingdom, amphibious nonhumans of the Vast Swamp The County of Sunndi lies in a natural basin bordered by the Hestmark Highlands to the east, the Hestmark Peaks (Glorioles) to the north, and the Hollow Highlands to the west. This realm was once part of the South Province (Ahlissa) of the Great Kingdom, but gained its independence in 455 CY under the leadership of the gray elf Count Turentel Esparithen. It became a staunch member of the Iron League. Its independence has endured for more than a century, facing only fleeting skirmishes with the South Province as the Herzog, deprived of the Overking’s support, can do little more than snarl in vain. The gray elf Count Hazendel, a wise and just ruler, currently rules Sunndi building an equitable society for all. Sunndians are fiercely progressive, though they have a deep- seated hatred for the frog-faced inhabitants of the southern Vast Swamp who venerate the toad-god Wastri. The Menowood lies beyond Sunndi’s borders, but its nonhuman clans are loosely allied with the kingdom. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. S1 Tomb of Horrors.

Tenh Proper Name: Duchy of Tenh Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Duchess Ehliyah Raynar III (human)) His Radiance, Duke Ehyeh III of Tenh [NG male human] Government: Independent feudal monarchy Major Settlements: Nevond Nevnend; Calbut, Redspan Resources: Foodstuffs, platinum Population: Human, Halfling, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-elf, Half-orc Law: LN Allies: County of Urnst, Nyrond Enemies: Bandit Kingdoms, Stonehold, trolls from the Troll Fens, the Pale Tenh has always been under the rule of its line of dukes, and the Tenha take pride in their Flan heritage. After Nyrond was defeated at the Battle of a Fortnight’s Length in -110 CY, the Duke of Tenh bent the knee to the Grand Prince of Aerdy. The magnanimous Grand Prince gave him the right to continue his rule, albeit as part of the nascent Great Kingdom. Thus, Tenha were largely content to live under distant Overkings who granted them the freedom to govern their own affairs. Yet when the Kingdom of Nyrond seceded from the Great Kingdom, Tenh also rose in defiance. This nation sits in a precarious position - the Bandit Kingdoms press against its western borders across the Artonsamay and Zumker Rivers, while the Pale would gladly take Tenh’s eastern lands and convert its folk to the One True Path. In the north, the savage Rovers of the Barrens are ruthless in their raids. To the south are allies in the Urnst States and the Kingdom of Nyrond. The Tenha possess a profound affinity for nature and magic, especially the illustrious Keepers of the Flan — an assembly of mages, druids and loremasters drawn from the clans. The archmage Nystul maintains a residence in Redspan, and provides arcane assistance to his homeland. Most Tenha are possessed of an indomitable spirit with a proud tradition of forging battle-hardened warriors, epitomized by Duke Ehyeh. Their cavalry, the Tenha Host, ranks among the finest in the Flanaess, and their victory over the Aerdy a century and a half ago that solidified Tenh independence is often recounted by their lorekeepers. 42 Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. “Protection circles and the like, plus news of the north central Flanaess” - Dragon Magazine #56.

Border clashes are common in Tusmit, though much of this turmoil is dealt with by extensive use of mercenaries. The pashalik is known for its fertile farmland and skilled artisans, particularly finely crafted weapons and armor. The wealth of Tusmit has also attracted many thieves and assassins, who operate openly in its cities. The Pashalik of Tusmit employs mercenaries from all surrounding lands, including Ulakandar, Ull, Perrenland, and dwarves from the Yatil and Crystalmist Mountains. Numerous halflings, dwarves, gnomes and even elves can be found among the artisan guilds of Tusmit.

Ulek, County of Proper Name: County Palatine of Ulek Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Countess Lewenn Richfield (human)) His Noble Mercy, Lewenn, Count Palatine of Ulek, Archdruid (N male human) Government: Hereditary feudal monarchy; count must be member of druidic hierarchy, and fulfill ritual requirements unique to the County; formerly a member of Keoland Major Settlements: Junre; Kewlbanks, Courwood Resources: Foodstuff, copper, silver, gems (I-II) Population: Human, Gnome, Halfling, Elf, Dwarf, Half-elf, Half-orc 43 Law: N Allies: other Ulek states, Keoland, Gran March, Verbobonc, Dyvers, Greyhawk, Knights of Luna, Celene (in theory), Knights of the Watch (weak), druidic circles Enemies: The Pomarj, Iuz The County of Ulek is ruled by a cadet branch of one of the royal families of Keoland. As such, it has long enjoyed a special status above that of other provinces, enhanced by its close relations with the dwarves and elves of the surrounding states. Politics in the County are strongly tied to the druid hierarchy, though it is not an outright religious holding. The rolling hills are filled with small villages and farmsteads that are home to gnome brewers and woodworkers who produce much of the County’s trade exports. The rulers allow their subjects to live their lives, providing more guidance than seeking to rule by edicts. The people of the County show a stronger Flan strain than the general Oeridian-Suel mix of Keoland, though it is distinct from that of the states west of the Javan River. There is a very large gnome and halfling population in the County, and their representatives have significant influence in the court of the Count. Ulek, Duchy of Proper Name: Duchy of Ulek Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Duke Grenowin (elf)) His Noble Radiance, Duke Grenowin of Ulek (CG male elf) Government: Independent feudal monarchy with hereditary rulership, royal and major noble houses are exclusively elven; formerly a member of Keoland Major Settlements: Axegard; Tringlee, Waybury Resources: Foodstuffs, cloth, electrum, gold, silver, gems (I-II) Population: Human, Half-elf, Elf, Gnome, Halfling Law: CG Allies Ulek states, Keoland, Gran March, Sterich, Geoff, Verbobonc, Kron Hills, Highfolk, Veluna, Furyondy, Dyvers, Greyhawk, Duchy of Urnst, Knights of Luna, Celene (strained), Knights of the Watch Enemies: The Pomarj (distant) Originally a vassal of Celene, the duchy joined Keoland for a brief period before its imperial phase - leaving when its wars of conquest began. Since then, it has established itself as independent of both Celene and Keoland, maintaining its neutrality in disputes between the two. The duchy is strongly allied with the other Ulek states, and the three ensure peace along the southern side of the Lortmil Mountains. The duchy is an elven realm, with a strong human minority. These humans are predominantly Suel from one of the royal houses of Keoland, although there are Oerid and Flan elements. Ulek, Principality of Proper Name: Principality of Ulek Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Princess Olynn Corond (dwarf)) His Serene Highness, Prince Olinstaad] Corond of Ulek, Lord of the Peaks of Haven [LG male dwarf] Government: Independent dwarf realm, formerly a member of Keoland Major Settlements: Gryrax; Eastpass, Havenhill, Thunderstrike Resources: Foodstuff, silver, gems (II-IV) Population: Dwarf, Human, Halfling, Gnome Law: LG Allies: Bissel, Celene (barely), Gran March, Geoff, Keoland, Ulek states Enemies: The Pomarj The Principality of Ulek is a dwarven counterpart to the Duchy. Like the Duchy it joined with, then separated from, Keoland before and because of its northern conquests. A more significant element of the history of the Principality is the Hateful Wars. After it became independent again, the Uleks and Celene united to drive the orcs and goblins living under the Lortmil Mountains out. They were successful but the surviving orcs and goblins fled to the Pomarj, usurping it from the humans there who had once been vassals of the Prince. When Celene refused to help retake the province, relations between the two soured thus harming relations between the Uleks. Although the Uleks have since repaired their alliance, all three remain distant from Celene. The inhabitants of the Principality are predominantly dwarves. The humans are mostly Suel related to the southern royal house of Keoland, with Oeridian-Flan admixture of the Uleks. Further Reading •	Anthony Prior. WGQ1 Patriots of Ulek. TSR 1992. Ull Proper Name: Ull Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Orakhan Drasika Borinok (human)) His Illustrious Ferocity, Draske, the Orakhan of Ull (CE male human) Government: Independent tribe composed of many large nomadic families, all ruled by a dictatorial monarch Major Settlements: Ulakand; Kester Resources: Silver, gems (II) Population: Human, Halfling, Orc, Half-orc Allies: None 44 Enemies: Ulakandar, hill tribesmen Ull is a semi-nomadic domain encircled by mountains and vast grasslands. During the great migrations some Oeridian tribes chose instead to settle in this secluded region. The arrival of the Ull tribe (once part of the Ulakandar) led to disaster for these settlers, as the fierce nomads took the plains and even towns as their own. This land is now an unforgiving place known for its warlike horsemen, monstrous blood sports, and other depravities. Despite this, Ull has become an important trade nexus between the Baklunish states and the Dry Steppes. The rulership of Ull is never certain, often changing due to duels or assassination. Due to this instability, the town of Kester enjoys some autonomy from their nomadic kin in Ulakand. The northern half of Ull is composed of traditional Baklunish nomads, while an equal number of families live in the more settled south. The native Oeridian tribes were pushed into the foothills where they compete for survival with local orc and ogre clans. Trade caravans have inevitably brought hardy families of halflings to inhabit the towns of Ull. Urnst, County of Proper Name: County of Urnst Ruler: (in DMG - Countess Belissica Gellor (human)) Her Noble Brilliancy, the Countess Belissica of Urnst (CG female human) Government: Feudal monarchy owing fealty to the Duchy of Urnst, though internal affairs are conducted independently; hereditary rulership out of a very broad noble (not royal) family (House Gellor) with strong adventuring and military service Major Settlements: Radigast City; Brotton, Caporna, High Mardreth, Trigol Resources: Foodstuffs, cloth, gold Population: Human, Halfling, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-elf, Half-orc Law: NG Allies: Duchy of Urnst, Greyhawk, Nyrond, Flinty Hills, Furyondy, Tenh Enemies: Empire of Iuz, Bone March, the Pale (distrusted) The County of Urnst is home to a diverse population, largely of Oeridian descent, who are resistant to both Aerdi influence and rule by a Nyrondal monarch. The Palatine Duke of Urnst long encouraged separatist sentiments in the county, eventually forcing the King of Nyrond to agree to its independence. The land, stretching from the great bend of the Artonsamay River south to the Franz, and along the shores of Nyr Dyv, is governed by House Gellor, with Countess Belissica as its current leader. The county is allied with and under the protection of the Duchy of Urnst, though its ruler is by no means subordinate to the Duke. The Duke, however, is attempting to marry his eldest son to the Countess in hopes of uniting the two lands permanently. The County maintains a small but efficient squadron of warships on the Nyr Dyv, and an army of about 2,000 calvary and infantry stationed at key strongholds. In times of need noble levies can raise an additional force ten times that size within a week or two. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax. Saga of Old City (A “Gord the Rogue” novel). TSR 1985.

Because of this wealth, the Duchy of Urnst 45 has long been coveted by the kingdoms of Aerdy and later Nyrond. When Nyrond gained their independence, they seized the County of Urnst and began preparing troops to cross the Nesser River. However, their initial crossings were repelled by war galleys, and the campaign faltered later that year, never to be resumed. The Duchy faces ongoing challenges along its borders: conflicts with Greyhawk over the Cairn Hills, desert nomad raids along the Abbor-Alz frontier, and tensions with the lakemen of Nyr Dyv. The Duke remains proactive, having developed an excellent army of borderers and maintaining a central cavalry force, as he still harbors distrust toward Nyrond.

Valley of the Mage Proper Name: Valley of the Mage Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - The Mage of the Valley (identity unknown)) His Most Magical Authority, the Exalted Mage of the Valley and Laird of the Domain (details unknown) Government: Independent freeholds acknowledging an unknown ruler Major Settlements: None Resources: Unknown Population: Human, Elf, Gnome, Halfling, Half-elf Law: N Allies: None Enemies: Most elves of the Flanaess No armies have ever attacked from the valley and the dangers of the Dim Forest prevent any outside army from threatening the place. Indeed, the forest is so dangerous that very few adventuring parties have succeeded in returning from that unknown land. Those adventurers tell tales that the residents of the valley, who include a significant number of gnomes and unusually tall elves among the human inhabitants, all serve a wizard of incredible power that only a few have ever seen. Whatever the truth, as long as no dangers emerge, the neighboring realms are content to ignore the place and whoever, or whatever, rules there. Further Reading •	Gary Gygax.

Veluna Proper Name: Archclericy of Veluna Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Canon Hazen (human)) His Venerable Reverence, the Canon of Veluna, Hazen, Shepherd of the Faithful (LG male human) Government: Theocracy ruled by the Canon of Veluna, who is advised by the College of Bishops and the Celestial Order of the Moons, made up of representatives from seven secular noble houses and a representative from the Viscounty of Verbobonc Major Settlements: Mitrik; Devarnish, Veluna City Resources: Foodstuffs, copper, silver, gold Population: Human, Elf, Half-elf, Gnome, Halfling, Dwarf, Half- elf, Half-orc Law: LG Allies: Furyondy, Verbobonc, Highfolk, Bissel, Kron Hills, Ulek States, Shield Lands, Gran March, Dyvers (weak), all branches of the church of Rao across the Flanaess. Celene (distrusted), Knights of the Hart, Knights of Luna. Enemies: Empire of Iuz, Ket, the Pomarj (minor), Knights of the Watch and Knights of Dispatch (distrusted), Valley of the Mage (distrusted), Perrenland (distrusted) During the Great Migrations by the Oeridians, the Vollar tribe settled the area between the Velverdyva and Fals Rivers, integrating peacefully with the Flan tribes that inhabited the “Vale of Luna” and followed Rao. When the Great Kingdom expanded west the Velunese greeted them peacefully, and wisely chose to integrate with the Aerdi. They tempered the aggression of the royalty of Ferrond, and Velunese followers of Rao occupied important positions in the court. When Furyondy seceded in 254 CY, Veluna followed it and gained independence although remaining close to the new kingdom of Furyondy. Trade tensions due to Dyvers strained relations, and Veluna was occupied progressively from 350 CY by Keoland during its expansionist phase. Eventually the Keoish were driven out by Furyondy in the Short War, but the reunion was ended in 446 CY. Veluna aided in suppressing the Horde of Elemental Evil in 559 CY led by its Provost Marshal, Prince Thrommel of Furyondy. The folk of Veluna represent the best aspects of the common species. Here, people live in harmony, farming and working together to build a common culture founded on 46 the tenets of peace, reason, and serenity. The influence of the church of Rao is everywhere in Veluna. Verbobonc Proper Name: Viscounty and Town of Verbobonc Ruler: (in DMG 2014 - Viscountess Wilfrick Rejin (human)) His Lordship, the Viscount Wilfrick of Verbobonc [LG male human] Government: Semi- independent territory owing fealty to the Archclericy of Veluna (but virtually autonomous in practice) Major Settlements: Verbobonc Resources: Copper, gems (I-IV), lumber Population: Human, Elf, Half-elf, Gnome, Halfling, Dwarf, Half- elf, Half-orc Law: LG Allies: Furyondy (distrusted), Veluna, Knights of the Hart (distrusted) Enemies: Empire of Iuz, the Pomarj, gnomes of the Kron Hills, assorted evil cults The people of Verbobonc are friendly yet cautious, often wary that a stranger might be just as likely to harm them as greet them. Their greatest fear is demons, as these creatures have visited the region and left lasting scars. Beneath the surface, numerous evil cults still lurk, hiding in the shadows of everyday life. The people of Verbobonc channel their caution into a strong work ethic. Although independent, the entire viscounty is a bishopric devoted to St. Cuthbert and follows the guidance of the Archclericy of Veluna. Adventurers - most of them well meaning, but all unpredictable and occasionally destructive - make up a surprisingly large portion of Verbobonc’s armed population.

Wegwiur (Wolf Nomads) Proper Name: The Wegwiur Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Wolf- Mother Bargra Yefkos (human)) The Fearless Wolf Leader, Tarkhan of all the Wegwiur, Commander of the Relentless Horde, Bargru [CN male human] Government: Numerous loosely allied nomad tribes; hereditary leader of the ruling clan has authority (limited by charisma and force) over the other khans Major Settlements: Eru Tovar; Ungra Balan Resources: Furs and hides, copper, horses Population: Human, Halfling, Elf Allies: Hunting Lands (Rover of the Barrens) Law: CN Enemies: Empire of Iuz, Chakyik (Tiger Nomads) – sometimes, evil nonhuman tribes and bandits from Arn (Blackmoor) and Cold Marshes The Wegwiur (Wolf Nomads) are a stoic nation of barbarians. Though their population can be unpredictable, a Wolf Nomad’s word is reliable, and many have earned the trust of caravan leaders traveling to unknowingly violate one of their cultural taboos. Such incidents are so frequent that experienced merchants often budget extra time and money to make amends for unexpected transgressions. The Wolf Nomads harbor a deep hatred for Iuz, and the two have never been on good terms. The realm’s main city, Eru Tovar, stands prepared to withstand a siege should Iuz attack. Their defiance in the face of such great evil has earned them the respect of many outsiders.

Wild Coast, The Proper Name: The Territory of Narwell; The Holdings of Safeton; The Lands of Cantona; The State of Fax; The Lands of Badwall; The Free City of Elredd. Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Various burgomasters, lord mayors, and others) Various petty rulers Government: Various petty noble realms Major Settlements: Elredd, Badwall, Fax, Narwhal, Safeton Resources: None outstanding Population: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling Law: Varies Allies: Greyhawk, Verbobonc, Celene, Principality of Ulek (all tenuous) Enemies: The Pomarj, nonhuman tribes of the Suss Forest and Welkwood The western shores of the Sea of Gearnat are known as the Wild Coast, a region long regarded as a haven for malcontents, dissidents, nonhumans, and outcasts from other states. It is a scenic but not particularly fertile area, featuring rolling countryside interspersed with woodlands, fens, and scattered dwellings. The region includes parts of the Gnarley Forest, all of the Welkwood east of the Jewel River, and the Suss Forest. 47 At various times, parts of the Wild Coast have been controlled by Celene, the Prince of Ulek, the Gynarch of Hardby, and the Free City of Greyhawk. The Wild Coast remains a free territory made up of petty nobles, robber barons, guild-controlled towns, fishing and forest villages, freebooters, mercenaries, and displaced people of all kinds. Its remote and isolated position, lack of resources, and limited strategic value have left it largely independent, and whenever conquered its inhabitants have always managed to reclaim their freedom. Many famous adventurers have come from the area, including Mordenkainen, Tenser and Robilar. Further Reading •	Mike Beeman. “Playing the political game”. Dragon Magazine #90. TSR 1984.

Yeomanry Proper Name: The Yeomanry League Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Freeholder Vyndi Skysperar (goliath)) His Steadfastness, Crispin Redwell, the Freeholder, Spokesman for the Yeomanry League NG male human] Government: Democratic republic with limited franchise Major Settlements: Loftwick; Longspear Resources: Foodstuffs, cloth, silver, gems (II), mercenaries Population: Human, Halfling, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-elf, Half- orc Law: LG Allies: Keoland (weak), Sterich (weak) Enemies: Sea Princes Long a part of Keoland, the freeholders of this land objected to the wars of conquest and declared independence. A short and nasty war secured that status, and the people remain fiercely protective of their independence from Keoland. Despite that, mercenary companies from the land are their primary export to Keoland, as well as being a key source of income and the path to voting within the nation. The people of the Yeomany are the typical Oeridian- Suel mix with a somewhat stronger Flan strain than within Keoland proper. There is a significant elven population within the nation, and the dwarves and halflings of the surrounding hills are valued allies. Zeif Proper Name: Sultanate of Zeif Ruler: (in DMG 2024 - Sultan Naxas Murad (human)) His Omnipotence, the Glory of the West, the Sultan of Zeif, Murad [LN male human] Government: Hereditary feudal monarchy with advisers including a grand vizier Major Settlements: Zeif; Antalotol, Ceshra Resources: Foodstuffs, gems (III), horses, livestock Population: Human, Orc, Halfling Law: LN Allies: Tusmit (sometimes), Ulakandar (sometimes) Enemies: Ekbir (sometimes), Ulakandar (sometimes), Ket (sometimes), Tusmit (sometimes), Knights of the Watch The Sultanate of Zeif is the largest Baklunish state, bordering the warm currents of the Dramidj Ocean, stretching westward to the Gulf of Ghayar and to the Tuflik River to the east. The southern border of Zeif is wide open plains, shared with the nomadic tribes of Ulakandar. Though there is little mineral wealth here besides prized chrysoberyls and peridots, the land is quite fertile. The sultanate owes its prosperity in large part to its unparalleled navy and trade by the powerful Mouqollad Consortium. Merchant vessels and caravans from Zeif are seen throughout the Western Flanaess and as far east as the city of Greyhawk. The sultan has a claim of succession to the ancient Baklunish Empire which is in dispute with neighboring Ekbir. Halflings are a common sight in the cities of Zeif. Also found among the citizenry of Zeif is a considerable population of orcs, who are descendants of mercenaries employed by the Baklunish Empire before the Invoked Devastation. Nomads of the Ulakandar are often hired by the sultanate to protect caravans or as mercenary cavalry in frequent border conflicts with other Baklunish states. Further Reading •	Fred Weining. “Zeif: Rock of the West”. Living Greyhawk Journal #5. Wizards of the Coast 2001. 48 Chapter 4: Chapter 4: Geography Geography Climate & Seasons T he Flanaess climate and weather is relatively mild. Outside the northern lands winter temperatures rarely drop below freezing outside the two months of winter, or at night during early spring and late autumn. For most lands only in the depths of winter will there be a few days when temperatures reach freezing, before the weather begins warming again. The northeastern and northern central lands of the Flanaess can be considerably colder, due to the seas in those areas, resulting in winter lasting about twice the duration as elsewhere. However, the Dramidj Ocean’s warm currents tend to temper the be ordering lands’ climate. Spring and autumn are longer seasons. Summer in central Oerik can last five or more months. The prevailing winds tend in winter and autumn to being northeasterly. At other times they tend to be easterlies and southeasterlies. Much of the Flanaess enjoys bountiful harvests due to good rainfall. Forests Adri Forest The Adri Forest is an expansive and ancient woodland filled with game animals and high-quality trees. It has been reduced by about half since the establishment of the Great Kingdom due to farmland expansion. The forest provides valuable resources such as timber for shipbuilding, homes, furniture, and weapons, as well as game for furs, food, 49 and trophies. Additionally, food is gathered and fish are taken from the Harp River. The foresters of the Adri hold resentment towards the Great Kingdom, with ranger-led groups beginning to push back against intrusions into the forest. Several druidic faiths, including that of Obad-Hai under the guidance of Archdruid Immonara, are present and active in the eastern Flanaess. The faith of Ehlonna, which strongly supports the rangers, is particularly militant. At the heart of the Adri, in a perilous area known as the Coldwood, lies the rumored location of an ancient elven city. No elves venture there, nor do they permit others to enter. Amedio Jungle The Amedio Jungle is an enormous tropical rainforest southwest of the Flanaess, stretching over 300 leagues to the south. It is home to fierce wildlife, dangerous monsters, and various human tribes, all of which are said to prey on other nonhumans. The jungle is also filled with carnivorous and poisonous plants, which are believed to possess potent medicinal and magical qualities. Axewood The Axewood is known for its reputation as a mystical faerie land. The people of Keoland are cautious, harvesting only the trees from the forest’s edges and taking only what is necessary. Thelwood The Thelwood is a small forest near Rel Deven. It is inhabited by wood folk, wood elves, voadkyn (forest giants), and treants, and protected by several druids of Obad-hai Burneal Forest The Burneal Forest extends for more than 1,000 miles. This vast expanse of pines and firs is never narrower than 100 miles and, in some areas, exceeds 200 miles in width. Although the forst is home to great northern elk, large deer, and other game, the Wolf and Tiger Nomads occasionally venture into the Burneal, but their hunts often result in meager returns. Celadon Forest The Celadon Forest is shared by Nyrond and the Duchy of Urnst. Both Duke Karll of Urnst and King Archbold of Nyrond maintain a friendly relationship with the generally peaceful elves and woods folk of the forest. The forest is home to towering oaks and elms, cared for by treants, elves, and other sylvan beings who ensure no living tree is harvested. Humans and elves involved in trade with the outside world are mostly herbalists. The renowned Keoghtom’s ointment is said to be made from ingredients gathered in this forest. Rangers, mainly humans and half- elves from the southwest Duchy of Urnst, are trained in the Celadon, particularly at Stalwart Pines, the only formal ranger school in the Flanaess. Dapple Wood The Dapple Wood is a small forest that serves as an important source of timber and game for Furyondy. Ships traveling along the Velverdyva River frequently stop for the night at the free-spirited villages located along the forest’s shores. Dim Forest The towering ancient trees of the Dim Forest are so wide and leafy that the forest floor remains dim, even on the brightest days. It is said that elves still inhabit the areas west of the Javan River, while other parts of the forest are home to dreadful, shadowy creatures. Dreadwood A royal decree from Keoland grants control of much of the Dreadwood to the elves, who safeguard it on behalf of the crown. Despite their efforts, attempts to rid the forest of malevolent creatures have consistently failed. Raiders from the Sea Princes and tribes of hostile nonhumans from the Hool Marshes frequently use the forest to launch attacks on southern Keoland. The elves, along with royal garrisons, fend off these invaders, often at significant cost. Fellreev Forest The Rovers of the Barrens once hunted this forest, but it is now under entirely under the control of the Bandit Kingdoms or the Horned Society. Various strange creatures roam the central parts including, rumors say, small bands of Sylvan Elves and human tribes. Forlorn Forest The eastern edge of the Forlorn Forest defines the border of the Hunting Lands. Though the forest is not rich in resources, it serves as a natural barrier, concealing the increasing number of coastal settlements established by the Rovers. Gamboge Forest The ancient, thick Gamboge Forest lies between Nyrond and the Pale, though neither nation claims ownership. Elves, humans, and gnomes make their homes within the forest. However, ogres and hobgoblins from the nearby mountains frequently raid the woodland villages or use the forest for cover to venture into the plains beyond. As a result, the forest’s inhabitants train their young in the use of swords and bows to defend themselves. Despite these threats, the Gamboge remains relatively peaceful. 50 Gnarley Forest Home to various wood folk humans, elves and gnomes, parts of this forest are claimed by Verbobonc, Dyvers, Celene, and Greyhawk. It is mainly regarded as as part of the Wild Coast, but those who live here are free-spirited folk with no formal government. The northern east parts are favorably inclined to the Viscount of Verbobonc, while those in the south favor the Queen of Celene. The forest is home to various fearsome creatures, and many nonhuman bands infiltrate from the Pomarj, through the Suss and Welkwood, intent on looting and raiding. Others enter covertly via the mountains and hills to the north. Grandwood Forest The towering hardwoods and dense vegetation of the Grandwood Forest serve as one of the few remaining sanctuaries for good within the Great Kingdom. Elves are the most powerful faction within the forest and are highly cautious of outsiders. Inhabitants also include human wood folk, gnomes and halflings, as well as various nonhumans in the southern parts. Hornwood This fair-sized woodland in Geoff is the Grand Duke’s favored hunting spot. Fearsome creatures are often found here, with some coming down from the Crystalmists mountains. Groups of Sylvan Elves also dwell here. The wood is named for the hornwood tree that grows there, which are tough and resilient. The straightest limbs of these trees are used to make the finest of elven bows, but such wood is uncommon and is hard to prepare. Hraak Forest The Hraak Forest is a dense woodland of pines and firs, primarily used by the people of Stonehold for fuel, trapping and hunting. Its depths are home to great bears, wolves, and a significant number of white dragons that make their lairs there. Iron Wood The Iron Wood, located in the western part of the Viscounty of Verbobonc, is a dense hardwood forest rumored to be haunted by various hostile lycanthropes. A narrow trade road runs through the forest, connecting Verbobonc to the walled city of Devarnish in Veluna, though it is rarely used as most merchants prefer river travel. The area is frequently shrouded in thick mist and fog. Loftwood The pine trees of the Loftwood were once highly valued for shipbuilding. Although a significant portion of the forest was damaged by a massive fire, humans and dwarves are now working to reclaim the northern edges. The forest has become an active battleground between human forces and the orcs and gnolls that inhabit the southern regions. Menowood Once ruled by a powerful druid named Sverdras Meno, the Menowood remains home to ancient beings, including treants and faerie folk. Nutherwood The southern boundary of the Theocracy of the Pale is defined by the lower edge of the Nutherwood. Many people live in this region, beyond the immediate reach of the Theocrat’s rule. However, the forest is also home to numerous dangers, including ogres, ankhegs, giant beetles, and carnivorous plants, which pose a significant threat to the unwary. Oytwood The Oytwood, a small forest within Geoff, is inhabited by elves and some wood folk. The Oytwood is also abundant with fruit trees and edible fungi. Phostwood The Phostwood is one of the most eerie forests in the entire Flanaess. The forest’s unique trees emit a faint phosphorescent glow as they decay, casting an otherworldly light throughout the area. This forest lies on the northern side of the Yol River and within Tenh, but bandits from bordering realms operate here on an ongoing basis. Rieuwood The Rieuwood forms the northern border of Sunndi, with its towering hardwood trees reaching high into the sky. The forest is heavily patrolled and defended by elves and rangers who vigilantly guard against incursions from South Province. Its eastern edges trace the road leading to Sunndi’s capital, Pitchfield. Sable Wood The Sable Wood, an evergreen forest, lies within the territory of the Ice Barbarians. Winter wolves are known to roam its western half. The forest is named after the Sablewood trees, which are short with thick trunks. Their branches are highly valued for crafting arrow shafts. Wood harvested during the dead of winter has the finest grain and, when treated with hot oils, turns a rich, lustrous black. The barbarians hold this material in high regard and do not export it. 51 Silverwood The Silverwood, located in the Duchy of Ulek, is home to many elves. It is said that the elves carefully tend to the trees, shaping them into unique forms. From these trees, they harvest a delicious and nourishing sap, which is used to make their renowned elven mead. Spikey Forest The Spikey Forest separates the territories of the Frost and Snow Barbarians. Both groups utilize the tall pines from this woodland for crafting ship masts and spars. Suss Forest Where the Welkwood meets the Jewel River near the Ulek city of Courwood, the forest transforms into the Suss. This gloomy forest is filled with thorn trees, brambles, briars, and dense thickets. The massive trees, blackened with age, seem to loom menacingly over those who pass beneath them. While the western part of the forest is open and clean, the area east of the Jewel River is much more ominous. Orcs and goblins with ties to their Pomarj kin reside in this part of the Suss. There are many stories of a lost city hidden within the forest, but few are brave enough to investigate. Tangles The Tangles is a small woodland located north of the Rift Canyon, with vegetation as dense as any jungle. Timberway Forest The Timberway Forest, a narrow woodland, separates the Frost Barbarians from the people of Ratik. By treaty, both realms share its pine and fir trees equally. These trees are highly valued for shipbuilding, and the forest also provides an abundant source of game. Udgru Forest The Udgru Forest is vast and densely wooded. While it is rich with game, it is also dangerous, as monsters from the Yatil Mountains and renegades from Tusmit and Ekbir lie in wait for unsuspecting travelers. Vesve Forest The Vesve Forest, also known as the High Forest, is the largest hardwood forest in all of the Flanaess and plays a crucial role in the balance of power in the north. Iuz refuses to relinquish any claim to the woodland, while Furyondy and the Highfolk support the forest’s inhabitants in their efforts to resist evil forces. The forest is home to enough woodsmen to fill a large city, bolstered by good- hearted individuals willing to fight and die to contain Iuz’s wickedness. The humans are aided by elves, gnomes, and halflings. Currently, the elves are their allies control the western and southwestern parts of the forest, while the northeastern regions are held by Iuz. These lands are occupied by unaligned bands of orcs, goblins, and gnolls, who are hostile to anyone. The area where these territories overlap is claimed by no one and has become a dangerous no-man’s land, little more than a battlefield in the woods. The forest provides a wealth of resources, including high- quality timber, plant resins for waterproofing, incense, preservatives, and a variety of medicinal berries and herbs. These resources are vital to the economic stability of Highfolk, Furyondy, and even Veluna. Welkwood The Welkwood is renowned for its exceptionally tall hardwood trees, many of which reach heights of over 100 feet. While Celene claims ownership of the entire forest, its control is primarily limited to the area west of the Jewel River. Mountains Barrier Peaks The Valley of the Mage is hidden within the Barrier Peaks, a range notorious for its unusual inhabitants. Some dwarven clans have established secret strongholds in these mountains, drawn by the wealth of precious minerals and gems found there. Clatspur Range The Clatspur Range contains some valuable mineral deposits, but it is only lightly populated. Most of the valleys are inhabited by Perrenlanders, who also have small villages scattered along the lower slopes. Corusk Mountains The lower regions of the Corusk Mountains are home to human inhabitants, while the central areas are teeming with various monsters. Farther east, the wildlife is less dangerous, but sudden, unpredictable freezing fogs and mists can descend from the peaks in minutes. Most of the mountain summits are capped with ice year-round. Crystalmist Mountains The Crystalmist Mountains boast the tallest peaks in all of the Flanaess, forming a vast range that includes the Barrier Peaks to the north and the Hellfurnaces to the south. Various monsters inhabit the lofty summits and strange valleys. Precious metals and gems are also found here, though prospectors need to be as skilled with sword and shield as they are with a pickaxe. Several dwarf holds fit this description, thriving by trading their resources with the people of the Dry Steppes, Sterich, and the Yeomanry. 52 53 Hestmark Peaks (Glorioles) The Hestmark Peaks (previously the Glorioles prior to DMG 2024) contain some of the tallest peaks for miles around. These mountains are home to dwarven kingdoms that are allied with the King of Sunndi. Despite their usual disdain for elves, the dwarves of the Glorioles view the Great Kingdom as a greater threat. Griff Mountains The Griff Mountains are home to numerous monstrous creatures, making them inhospitable to most settlements, though a few exist due to the valuable mineral deposits found here. Legends speak of a small, enchanting land hidden deep within the range, shielded from outsiders by magic and military might, and ruled by a powerful prince. This mysterious realm is said to have buildings with roofs made of precious metals, where gold replaces lead, and windows are crafted from mosaics of precious gemstones. Hellfurnaces The Hellfurnaces, unlike the Crystalmists to the north, are characterized by numerous active volcanoes, which are said to have been ignited during the Rain of Colorless Fire. This treacherous region is a hotbed of evil, made even more dangerous by the presence of creatures like fire giants and salamanders. The steep slopes of the Hellfurnaces conceal many entrances to the monster-filled tunnels of the Underdark. Jotens The Jotens are the largest spur of the Crystalmist Mountains and home to various giant tribes. The southern slopes are guarded by long-range Yeomanry spearmen, who are allied with dwarven forces. In the north, ongoing battles persist between agents of Sterich and the evil giants. Lortmil Mountains The Lortmil Mountains, a low range that has largely eroded into hills, are home to many dwarves, gnomes, and a few adventurous halflings. The mountains are known for containing some of the richest deposits of gems and precious metals in the land. Some of the dwarven clan leaders here are said to be as wealthy as princes. Various nonhuman tribes that used to terrorize these mountains were driven out in the Hateful Wars. Rakers The Rakers form the southern extension of the Griff Mountains, named for their towering, sharp peaks that seem to rake the sky. The range is home to large numbers of orcs, kobolds, and other dangerous creatures. However, a few dwarven enclaves also thrive here, extracting wealth from the mountain’s rich resources. Sulhaut Mountains The Sulhaut Mountains form a barrier between the barren Dry Steppes and the desolate Sea of Dust, extending westward from the junction of the Crystalmists and Hellfurnaces. Reports suggest that drow inhabit the eastern part of the range, where a treacherous network of mountain passes is believed to exist. Ulsprue The Ulsprue, a range of smaller peaks branching from the Crystalmists, is regarded as the boundary between the Flanaess and the rest of Oerik. Yatil Mountains The Yatil Mountains are home to various evil nonhuman tribes, giants, and other monsters, though in smaller numbers compared to the Crystalmists and Barrier Peaks. Hardy mountaineers – mainly humans, dwarves, and halflings – vigorously defend their territories here. The Yatils are rich in ore and gem deposits, though locating and mining these resources is a challenging task. Legends also tell of lost magical treasures hidden within the range. Hills & Highlands Abbor-Alz Located near the western border of Urnst, the rocky highlands of the Abbor-Alz are considered a small mountain range. Dwarven and gnome enclaves still exist in the northern region, though many have long shifted their focus from mining to craft-working. Blemu Hills The Blemu Hills form the southern boundary of the Bone March. Once home to thousands of dwarves and gnomes, the central hills are now roamed by orcs who explore the abandoned mines and strongholds left behind. Bluff Hills The western end of the Griff Mountains gradually descends into a rugged area of ridges and steep hills known as the Bluff Hills. This region has become a refuge for bandits and nomads, though they must contend with roaming bands of ferocious ogres. While the Bluffs contain copper and some gold deposits, the ongoing conflicts prevent significant exploitation of these resources. 54 Brass Hills Little is known about the Brass Hills, located in the center of the Bright Desert. They are thought to be named for ancient mining operations, though no pickaxe has touched these hills in nearly two thousand years. Cairn Hills The Cairn Hills are a vast expanse of rugged uplands, dotted with hundreds of ancient tombs and burial sites from a long-lost era. While many of these were explored long ago, the wealth uncovered from the crypts was instrumental in transforming the Free City of Greyhawk from a mere trading post into a prosperous city. Persistent adventurers still occasionally discover unexplored dungeons. The central hills are home to several thousand gnomes, while halflings reside in the northern areas where the land flattens, and dwarves live in the higher eastern regions. The northermost point of the hills, beyond the mouth of the Selintan River, is rich in rubies, emeralds, and diamonds, with local gnomes aligned with Greyhawk working the mines. Drachensgrab Hills The Drachensgrab Hills dominate the Pomarj peninsula, known for their abundant mineral wealth and dangerous inhabitants, particularly orcs and hobgoblins. At their center, the hills rise into small mountains, also called the Drachensgrabs. According to legend, disturbing the resting place beneath these mountains will awaken powerful beings in anger. Flinty Hills The Flinty Hills form the border between Nyrond and the Bone March. The inhabitants are divided between these two powers, with a third group consisting of autonomous gnomes in the east, led by Gnomeking Warren ap’Hiller. The southern hills are plagued by raiding nonhuman tribes from the Bone March, while Nyrond relies on the mines in the Flinty Hills for much of its mineral wealth. Gull Cliffs The Gull Cliffs are named for the many birds that nest along their edges. Stretching over 100 miles inland, these cliffs have been extensively mined by the Aerdi for centuries, leaving them riddled with abandoned shafts. The trade port of Roland sits on the coast within these hills. Reclusive clans of dwarves and gnomes dwell in the hills around. Headlands The rugged Headlands of Onnwal are inhabited by small groups of humans, known as Headlanders, along with many dwarves and gnomes. The region’s mineral wealth remains largely untapped. Hestmark Highlands The Hestmark Highlands, with their vast and rugged terrain, provide a perfect refuge for those disillusioned with the surrounding states. Hollow Highlands The Hollow Highlands earned their name from centuries of mining and burrowing. Though the mineral resources are now largely depleted, the beauty and fertility of the slopes more than compensate. These hills remain home to tribes of dwarves, gnomes, and halflings who are loyal to the crown of Sunndi and fiercely defend the land. Howling Hills The Howling Hills seem to carry a curse, having been the site of terrible bloodshed throughout history. The remains of humans, giants, and dwarves, long dead for centuries, are scattered across the craggy terrain, which also conceals several ancient burial complexes. Unsurprisingly, the hills are inhabited by numerous incorporeal undead. While the eastern part of the hills is firmly under the control of the Old One. Iuz’s hold on the western lands remains fiercely contested. Iron Hills The Iron Hills have been renowned for their high-quality ore for centuries, along with valuable deposits of gold and silver. The hills are home to the dwarven kingdom of the Iron Hills, ruled by King Holgi Hiruste, who is a strong ally of Irongate. Kron Hills The fertile upper slopes of the Kron Hills are primarily inhabited by gnomes, along with a few loosely allied human groups. Once part of Verbobonc, the northern gnome lands have since formed their own independent realm, known as the Free Assembly of the Kron Hills, under the wise rule of Urthgan, Eldest of Tulvar. The gnomes maintain good relations with the dwarves of the Lortmil Mountains and the isolationist kingdom of Celene to the south. Although the Kron Hills have been explored, they remain a dangerous region, especially in the wooded areas. Little Hills The Little Hills are so named only in comparison to the towering Jotens that overshadow them. The humans and dwarves who inhabit these hills are known for their fierce battle skills, and have been employed as mercenaries in Keoland for centuries. 55 Lorridges The Lorridges are a series of steep ridges and hills claimed by Veluna, Bissel, and Gran March. Gnomes and dwarves inhabit the area, often engaging in trade with their human neighbors. Mounds of Dawn The Mounds of Dawn are inhabited by monsters that descend from the northern Yatil Mountains. The hills are rich in fine mineral deposits and are also known for their lost treasures and ancient tombs, particularly near Lake Quag. Sepia Uplands Perrenland claims most of the Sepia Uplands and seeks to annex the eastern hills that extend into the Vesve Forest. The northern Sepias are home to large, fierce mountain lions, as well as various game animals. Stark Mounds The ancient Stark Mounds were likely once towering mountains. Gnomes and dwarves reside in the southern hills. Tors The Tors are a series of mesa-like hills. In the southern areas, where they meet the Hool Marshes, the hills are overrun with monsters and tribes that frequently raid the Yeomanry. Tusman Hills The Tusman Hills gradually ascend into the Yatil Mountains and are inhabited by humans known for their exceptional fighting skills. These people maintain a semi-independent status, often working as mercenaries for nearby states. Mountain goats and sheep are common in the area, some domesticated and others hunted. Griffons also inhabit the hills, preying on both livestock and hillmen. Islands Asperdi-Duxchan The southern islands of the Asperdi-Duxchan chain have a nearly tropical climate, while the northern isles are more temperate. Ataphads The southern islands of the Ataphads maintain a fairly temperate climate year-round, while the northern islands experience extreme seasonal variations. Olmans The Olmans, a pair of islands, are densely covered in jungle. The Scarlet Brotherhood has established a small port on the western island, though previous attempts by other foreigners to settle here have failed. The Brotherhood’s port seems likely to face a similar fate, as disease and madness often afflict those unaccustomed to the harsh, oppressive heat and challenging environment. Major Bodies of Water Lake Abanfyl Sightings of aquatic monsters on the surface of Lake Abanfyl are frequent. The lake is also rumored to be home to a family of dragons, who are said to reside on a a small, mist- covered island in its central waters. Aerdi Sea The Aerdi Sea is a busy waterway, frequented by both merchant ships and warships. Numerous battles have erupted between the Sea Barons and the Lordship of the Isles, along with occasional raids by the Frost, Ice, and Snow Barbarians. The sea is notorious for its diverse shark 56 population, some of which are aggressive and indiscriminate predators. Piracy is also common in these waters. Lake Aqal Lake Aqal is a captivating place of serene beauty and otherworldly tranquility. Despite its allure, the bandits of the Fellreev Forest, the native elves, and even the followers of Iuz avoid the lake. The wildlife around Lake Aqal is enough to deter most visitors, with many creatures growing to one and a half times their normal size – a particularly fearsome trait in the bears and leeches that are commonly found. Rumors also circulate about the presence of water nagas, dragons, and green hags. Big Seal Bay Big Seal Bay, a shallow extension of the Icy Sea, has long served as the border between Stonehold and the Ice Barbarians’ kingdom. During the summer months, the locals camp in the nearby forest to hunt seals. Few humans venture to the desolate eastern bay, though legend speaks of the carved outer doors of an ancient dwarven clanhold, visible high in the Corusk peaks. Blackmoor Bay Blackmoor Bay, a section of the Icy Sea, is split into upper and lower bays by a peninsula that extends into the frigid waters. A vast cloud of smoke drifts across the bay from the Burning Cliffs. In the outer bay, a powerful storm giant makes his home, vigilantly watching over the northern coastline. This northern region also serves as a refuge for a mix of barbarian and aquatic peoples. NOTE This may be renamed Arn Bay to reflect the name change to the Archbarony. Densac Gulf Little is known about the tropical waters of the Densac Gulf to the south. The Scarlet Brotherhood makes travel to this region particularly perilous, masquerading as pirates. The gulf is also home to a large population of sea monsters, which may be under the Brotherhood’s covert control. Dramidj Ocean The Dramidj Ocean stretches far to the west, with warm currents flowing past Zeif and Ekbir before turning north along the coast. In addition to the usual sea tales of monsters and deep-sea terrors, stories of marine puddings that cling to ships’ hulls, rotting them away and slowing their journey, are not to be dismissed. During the winter, the ocean is covered in thick layers of fog, and massive icebergs drift through the waters like ghost ships. Dunhead Bay Dunhead Bay, a shallow extension of Relmor Bay, lies between Onwal and Ahlissa. It is well-known for its excellent fishing and has been thoroughly charted. Fairwind Bay Fairwind Bay, a wide inlet along Nyrond’s southern coast, is a tranquil extension of Relmor Bay, known for its white sandy shores. The fishing is excellent, and trade flourishes when Nyrond and Ahlissa are not fighting naval battles on Relmor Bay. Bay of Gates The Bay of Gates forms the northernmost section of the Aerdi Sea. The Sea Barons maintain security in this area, protecting it from external piracy, though rogue Sea Barons still raid a few ships each year. Trade between many coastal nations is heavy here, but ships from the Lordship of the Isles are attacked on sight. It is also believed that the legendary “Sinking Isle” of Aerdy lore is located near the northern end of the bay. Sea of Gearnat The Sea of Gearnat is a long, curved bay with two distinct ends: Woolly Bay to the west and Relmor Bay to the east. Detailed navigational charts are available for the entire region. The Gearnat is fed by three major rivers, two of which – the Selintan and the Nesser – allow ships to travel deep into the Flanaess interior. Spring and autumn bring violent storms that make crossing the Gearnat particularly dangerous. The Straits of Gearnat, located between the Pomarj and Onnwal Peninsulas, remain open to shipping despite the threats of pirates. Numerous warships from Greyhawk, Nyrond, Irongate, and other states patrol the area to maintain the trade lanes. Grendep Bay Grendep Bay is a favored raiding ground for the Northern Barbarians, who possess intimate knowledge of the many inlets to the west and fjords to the east. In the height of summer, large sea monsters are frequently spotted playing in the bay. The bay becomes especially harsh in winter, with freezing winds that stir is waters into turmoil Icy Sea The Icy Sea remains frozen for most of the year, thawing only during the height of summer. Whales of various kinds are common, and it is rumored to be the domain of a powerful leviathan lord. The surrounding coasts, raiding when the opportunity arises. Even in summer, the Icy Sea is perilous, with dense fogs and drifting icebergs posing constant dangers. 57 Jeklea Bay Jeklea Bay in the Azure Sea is dominated by the Sea Princes, who use it as a base for raiding the Amedio Jungle for slaves and treasure. The seaweed-choked waters of Jeklea Bay are home to sea lions and kraken, and are stirred by a steady, clockwise-moving current. Lake Matteyus Lake Matteyus, a vast freshwater lake located deep within the Amedio Jungle, is known for generating periodic violent storms, earning it the nickname “Storm Lake.” The local tribes regard the lake as sacred and, during certain seasonal rituals, they venture out on large bargelike rafts to offer gold and other treasures to its waters. Nyr Dyv The Nyr Dyv, also known as the “Lake of Unknown Depths,” is the largest freshwater lake in the Flanaess and serves as a vital trade route. Ships travel its waters from several navigable inlets (Artonsamay, Veng, Velverdyva) and outlets (Nesser and Selintan), contributing to the wealth of numerous cities along its shores. Though the legendary dangers of the Nyr Dyv – ferocious storms and monstrous creatures - are a constant threat, modern sailors are better equipped to face them. Few ships venture into the lake’s allegedly bottomless open waters, preferring to stay near the coast. Most vessels on the Nyr Dyv are armed with harpoons and ballistae to ward off curious creatures. Rumors suggest that the lake hides the sunken remains of an ancient civilization known as the “Isles of Woe.” Occasionally, strange silver coins, jewelry, and obsidian carvings appear in markets, claimed to be relics of the isles, though they are often dismissed as forgeries. Oljatt Sea The Oljatt Sea, a region of the Solnor Ocean, is known for its extreme depths and the presence of giant sea monsters. Ships venturing into the sea waters often sail in convoys, chained together, with marines armed with pikes and bows ready to fend off giant octopi and enormous sea serpents. Massive sharks frequently follow the convoys, scavenging during battles, while giant crocodiles from the nearby Pelisso Swamp behave similarly. Pirates roaming these waters are common. Lake Quag Lake Quag is rich with fish, including giant pike and gar, making it a significant source of food. Although fishers themselves occasionally fall prey to the lake’s dangers. Nixies inhabit the waters and hold dominion over much of the lake’s western depths. Relmor Bay Relmor Bay, the eastern branch of the Sea of Gearnat, has long been a battleground between the forces of Nyrond and Onnwal and the naval squadrons of the Great Kingdom especially from its notorious port of Prymp, Solnor Ocean The Solnor Ocean, meaning “birthplace of the sun,” is believed to be the mightiest of Oerth’s oceans. A strong, clockwise current flows along the eastern coast of the Flanaess, carrying ships out to sea and bringing curious debris to the shores of the Lordship of the Isles. The vast Solnor entices adventurers from across the Flanaess, with tales of fantastic islands, undersea kingdoms, terrifying aquatic and aerial monsters, and a “Jungle of Lost Ships” filling old sailors’ fables. Bronze dragons are said to fly eastward over the Solnor, never to return, giving rise to stories of a “dragons’ graveyard.” The dragons themselves remain silent on the matter. Lake Spendlowe Lake Spendlowe, a tranquil valley lake, is the crown jewel of the southern Hold of the Sea Princes. Its pristine waters and stunning sunset reflections have been immortalized in paintings across the western Flanaess. Spindrift Sound Spindrift Sound connects the Solnor Ocean to the Aerdi Sea and is considered a small sea in its own right. It has long served as the traditional battleground between the Lordship of the Isles and the Sea Barons. Tilva Strait The Lordship of the Isles collects tribute from states seeking safe passage through the tropical, shark-infested Tilva Strait. This tribute is usually negotiated and paid in advance, with Lordship ships patrolling the waters to ensure the safety of those who paid while hunting down vessels from non-paying states. Lake Udrukankar Lake Udrukankar, a salt lake near the Dry Steppes, is nearly devoid of all life, with only a few birds and insects found near the mouth of the Rumikadath River. The lake was once much larger, especially to the north and east, where vast salt flats now remain. Salt is the region’s primary export. White Fanged Bay White Fanged Bay is named for the jagged, ice-covered rocks and icebergs that pose a danger to ships trying to land along its shores. In the summer, large numbers of walruses 58 and seals gather along the rocky coasts, while killer whales hunt in the surrounding waters. Whyestil Lake Whyestil Lake sees significant trade traffic between river cities and along the Veng River. Woolly Bay Woolly Bay sees immense maritime traffic, and has been a hub for merchants for centuries. Maps of the bay are highly detailed, even including bottom soundings and the locations of shipwrecks. These maps are widely available, making Woolly Bay one of the most well-known bodies of water in the Flanaess. Rivers Artonsamay River The Artonsamay River, navigable from the town of Redspan to its vast delta at the Nyr Dyv, is one of the longest rivers in the Flanaess. Crystal River The Crystal River, one of the safest waterways connected to the Veng River, originates from a small lake called Erstin. This lake also feeds the shallow creeks that supply the famous canals of Chendl, the capital of Furyondy. Davish River The Davish is a cold, fast-flowing tributary of the Javan River, unsuitable for large vessels. At its confluence with the Javan, it splits into two channels, with the isle of Avenstane rising between them. Deepstil River A tributary of the Dulsi, the shallow, clear waters of the Deepstil River run through the Vesve Forest. Dulsi River The Dulsi River, a deep inlet of Whyestil Lake, is navigable up to the fork of the brackish Blackwater River. Goods from the Wolf Nomads are transported south via river barges. Duntide River The Duntide River is a vital component of Nyrond’s renowned Nesser-Franz River system, transporting goods from regions as distant as Womtham and the Flinty Hills to the capital, Rel Mord. South of the capital, the river is deep enough to accommodate ocean-going vessels. Fals River The Fals River, a tributary of the Velvedyva, is navigable all the way to the city of Thornward in Bissel. It serves as the northern border of Veluna and flows past the capital, Mitrik, where palatial villas line its slow-moving waters. The Fals supports significant barge traffic. Flanmi River The expansive Flanmi basin drains nearly the entire surrounding region. Ships can navigate the river from its mouth all the way north to the imperial capital of Rauxes. Fler River The Fler River, the main inlet to Lake Quag, originates near the Land of Black Ice. It is believed that much of the river is navigable by large vessels. Flessern River The narrow, winding Fesem River sees little barge traffic. Its source is marked by the tower of Kurast, an eccentric water elementalist. Franz River The Franz River serves as the border between Nyrond and the County of Urnst and is navigable up to the merchant city of Trigol. North of Trigol, shallow-draft river-boats frequent the waters. The border was once heavily contested, leaving a series of old, ruined keeps along both banks. Frozen River The Frozen River flows swiftly and, while its surface often freezes during winter, the waters beneath continue to flow. Grayflood River The Grayflood River forms the southern border of lands claimed by Ahlissa. In earlier times this deep and scenic river valley belonged to Sunndi, as evidenced by the elven- built keeps along its northern banks,. Harp River The Harp River is one of the longest in the Flanaess, with its hidden headwaters deep in the Rakers. It is navigable for about half its length, and empties into Relmor Bay near the capital of Almor, Chathold. Hool River The Hool River, originating from the vast Lake Spendlowe, is a long waterway with broad, swampy banks. After leaving the lake, the river offers few safe passages. The massive 59 Hool Marsh makes navigating the river difficult, as the slow current is often the only indication that the river continues at all. Imeda River Imeda River is wide but shallow, allowing navigation for shallow-draft vessels all the way to its confluence with the Flanmi. Javan River The Javan River is the longest on the continent, though it is navigable by large vessels only as far as the town of Cryllor in Keoland. Jewel River Few rivers in the Flanaess carry as much lore as the Jewel. It marks the eastern border of the Principality of Ulek. The river is navigable as far north as the Drachensgrab Hills, and its swift waters continue to yield gold and gemstones to those who pan its currents. Nesser River The long and deep Neser River is of vital importance to both Nyrond and the Duchy of Urnst. Its lowlands are fertile, though prone to flooding. Were it not for the monster-infested Gnatmarsh, the Nesser would be the preferred route for captains traveling from Nyr Dyr to the Sea of Gearnat. Despite the swamp’s dangers, the Nesser remains a busy and vibrant waterway. Realstream River The Realstream River is primarily used to transport forest products from the heart of the Dim Forest. It is also an excellent source of fish and fresh water. Ritensa River The Ritensa River has long been the site of brutal border conflicts between the Horned Society, Bandit Kingdoms, and Shield Lands. Appropriately, much of its length is foul- smelling, fetid, and poisonous. Although the river is fully navigable, few ships venture along its waters. Rumikadath River The Rumikadath River is navigable, but the local nomads regard placing vessels on it as an act of desecration. Selintan River The Selintan River is broad and deep, allowing sea- going vessels to navigate as far north as Greyhawk City, with barges able to traverse its entire length. It carries a significant amount of traffic. Sheldomar River The Sheldomar River is the broadest and most majestic river on the continent, marking the boundary between Keoland and the Ulek states. It is navigable by sea-going vessels from the city of Gradsul to Keoland’s capital at Niole Dra. Tesser Torrent River The Tesser Torrent is a fast-flowing river that forms the northern border of the North Province of the Great Kingdom. It is not a navigable river due to rapids and relatively shallow depth. Thelly River The Thelly is a broad, shallow tributary of the Flanmi, navigable by sea-going vessels as far west as the city of Nulbish. Shallow barges carry significant traffic from Rel Deven and Hexpools through Kalstrand. Trask River The Trask River originates from a confluence of small streams and springs. It is navigable for 150 miles upstream from the Solnor, and is heavily fished along its entire length. Tuflik River The Tuflik River begins in the Banner Hills and flows into the Dramidj Ocean. It is navigable from the city of Ceshra to the coast. Velverdyva River The Velverdyva River is the busiest waterway in the Flanaess, draining lake Quag and flowing into the Nyr Dyv near the City of Dyvers. For much of its course, it forms the boundary between Furyondy and Veluna. The river is navigable by sea-going vessels from its mouth to nearly the fork of the Fals River. Barges can travel either to Thornward via the Fals or continue north to the city of Schwartzebuin. Veng River The Veng River has long served as a crucial border between the territories of Furyondy, the Horned Society, and Iuz. It remains relatively safe due to the presence of Furyondy’s navy. Fish are abundant, particularly near Whyestil Lake. 60 Yol River The Yol River is a deep enough waterway to support barge traffic to the Pale city of Wintershiven. Wetlands Cold Marshes The Cold Marshes are infamous for the vile creatures that dwell within their bogs, as well as the unnatural, life- draining mists that blanket the area. Gnatmarsh The Nesser River would be the ideal route between the Nyr Dyv and the Sea of Gearnat, if not for the foul Gnatmarsh, a desolate, blighted region only nominally claimed by Nyrond. The primary threat to travelers here is the swarms of insects, both ordinary and giant. Occasionally, completely bloodless corpses are found floating among the reeds. Despite the dangers, some desperate individuals still brave the marsh in flat-bottomed boats, fishing, trapping, harvesting, and even looting the bloated corpses. A coven of witches or hags is rumored to reside at the heart of the swamp, though their leader, known as the Weird of Gnatmarsh, has not been seen since the archmage Warnes Starcoat defeated her years ago. Hool Marshes The northern bend of the Hool River is surrounded by miles of treacherous mires and bottomless pools. The marshes are rife with natural dangers, from predatory animals to malevolent lizardfolk and pervasive diseases. Only the truly desperate seek refuge in the Hool. Lone Heath The Lone Heath is a blend of marshland and scrub, serving as a long-standing sanctuary for outlaws and refugees fleeing Aerdi tyrants, whether from the Overking or the Lord Mayor of Rel Astra. Rangers and druids from the Grandwood are known to watch over the area. Unusual elves and”marsh” dwarves dwell here. While the lowlands pose little real threat, the heart of the trackless marsh, with its eerie glowing lights, drives away even the bravest travelers. Mistmarsh The Mistmarsh is a vast, shallow swamp teeming with life. Lizardfolk control certain areas of the deeper marsh, and roaming packs of ghouls pose a significant danger to travelers. Pelisso Swamps Few explorers dare to venture into the fetid Pelisso Swamps. Those brave enough to make the journey describe the melodious calls of tropical birds and the evening chorus of poisonous, stinging insects. Giant crocodiles, amphibians, and carnivorous plants thrive among the towering ferns. Rumors also suggest a small family of black dragons makes their lair in the swamp. Many ships have become stuck in the quagmire, and it’s believed that some treasure still lies waiting to be claimed. Rushmoors The vast Rushmoors lie between Keoland and the Dim Forest, fed by an outflow of the Javan River. This unclaimed hinterland is filled with monsters, and bands of lizardfolk and kobolds roam its edges. In the western moors, farmers cultivate the tall, thick rushes that cover the land and work to drain the swampy areas for farmland Troll Fens Nestled in the shadow of the Griff Mountains, the Troll Fens are shrouded in cold, swirling mists. This foreboding swamp has threatened the northern borders of the Pale and Tenh since humanity first settled the region. While home to many monsters, it is most notorious for its namesake trolls. The Pale has built numerous keeps to defend against their incursions. Vast Swamp The Vast Swam, with its hot, brackish, deep water, forms the southern border of Sunndi and drains the entire region to the south. While it has served as a natural barrier protecting southern Sunndi for centuries, the swamp also poses a significant threat. It has long been a haven for monsters and outlaws who frequently raid Sunndi to fulfill their needs. Wastelands Barren Wastes Often referred to simply as the Wastes, this desolate expanse of rocky terrain stretches along much of the southern shore of the Icy Sea, extending inland for over a hundred miles. Legend holds that the area was devastated by a magical catastrophe. Now, only moss, lichen, and sparse grasses grow here, with stunted trees appearing in sheltered spots. Cold winds blow constantly, making it one of the most inhospitable places in the Flanaess. Land of Black Ice In the far north, at the very edge of the known lands of the Flanaess, lies a vast expanse of deep blue-black ice stretching endlessly across the horizon beyond the Burneal Forest and 61 the land of Blackmoor. The origin of this eerie landscape of dark ice remains a mystery. Strange arctic monsters roam the region, and the few humans living nearby fear to venture into it. Bright Desert Rumors speak of fantastic riches within the Bright Desert, with deposits of copper, gold, silver, and gems seemingly lying open for the taking among the dunes. However, these tales rarely account for the desert’s natives, who are deeply divided and united only in their fierce hatred of outsiders. The western desert is home to the neutral trading village of Ul-Bakak, the only stable point of contract between the desert dwellers and the rest of the Flanaess. Even reaching this peaceful village is perilous, as the pass to the nearby town of Hrdby is largely controlled by the Tareg, a suspicious and hostile people, even by Bright Desert standards. Dry Steppes West of the Crystalmist Mountains and the Ulsprue Range lie the Dry Steppes, an expanse of arid, sunbaked land. Once a flourishing garden, the region was devastated by the ancient Invoked Devastation, stripping it of life and beauty. Toward the central area the landscape becomes more hospitable and fertile. Nomadic hordes roam the steppes, migrating north during the summer and returning after the first winter rains. Rift Canyon This immense rift stretches over 180 miles in length and reaches up to 30 miles in width, with its depths rumored to reach a mile in certain areas. Filled with caverns, rainwater drains into the caverns from above. The canyon is surrounded by a rocky wasteland. Monsters have been cleared out of much of its length, but they are said to continue to range forth from the depths. The western end is avoided due to the fierce monsters that continue to dwell there despite attempts to remove them. A bandit lord styling himself the Plar of the Rift is said to command nonhuman warriors and monsters to maintain a stronghold against others, and take rich pickings. Attempts to attack bandit forces from the western end by Shield Lands forces have failed. The haunted White Plume Mountain lies south of the Riftcanyon, avoided by all. Sea of Dust The desolate wasteland of powdery dust and gray ash was once a lush, fertile region. It was destroyed when sheets of nearly invisible, fiery rain incinerated all living things and ignited the land with a colorless flame. What remains is a barren landscape of ash and dust, shaped into gentle rises and shallow depressions like waves on the sea. The scene quickly becomes far less tranquil when fierce desert winds whip the surface dust into choking clouds, capable of stripping flesh from bone. The deadly landscape is further worsened by the volcanic ash that constantly rains down from the Hellfurnaces.

The Circle of Eight is renowned throughout the Flanaess. However, its full membership has never been common knowledge - some members have been more public in their conduct than others. Mordenkainen has always been known as the leader of this group, in addition to being arguably the most famous mage in the Flanaess. Morenenkainen founded the Circle to replace his previous adventuring group, the Citadel of Eight, that was made up of a more disparate group of mages, clerics, warriors and rangers. When Serten, cleric of St Cuthbert, was killed at the Battle of Emridy Meadows in 569 CY that group went its separate ways (even if some members then joined the Circle when formed). With the return of Iuz in 570 CY, the archmage then looked to form a group of powerful wizards and mages to counter the power of influential beings and entities in Oerik. In addition to Mordenkainen, the Circle in 576 CY is made up of the following human male wizards or mages - Bigby, Drawmij, Nystul, Ottiluke, Otto, Rary of Ket, and Tenser. Each of the members have their own networks and agents, and adventurers are often employed to achieve the aims of the Circle without ever knowing who they were ultimately working for. Further Reading •	The Circle and its then members in 591 CY is detailed in “Wheels Within Wheels: Greyhawk’s Circle of Eight” by Gary Holian & Erik Mona in Living Greyhawk Journal #0 (Wizards of the Coast 2000). Knight Protectors of the Great Kingdom In -107 CY, as Grand Prince Almor II’s retinue neared Rel Astra, a cabal of Ur-Flan summoned a dread winged fiend to kill him. A band of commoners sold themselves dearly to protect the prince and kill the fiend, and he raised the survivors to knighthood - creating the Knights Protector of the Great Kingdom. Their Rules of Parslin would become the standard by which nearly all other orders of chivalry within the Flanaess would measure themselves. These warriors were well-respected, powerful and influential, sworn to ensure a united and protected 67 Great Kingdom under an honorable and lawful Overking. Admission was solely through merit. Some among the knighthood were followers of Heironeous and Hextor, their rivalry turned outward as they sought to surpass one another in deeds of glory. Others followed the sun god, Pelor. The knighthood’s darkest betrayal came in 203 CY when one of their greatest champions, Sir Kargoth, persuaded thirteen of his brothers and sisters to sack the sacred Temple of Lothan and claim the ancient Orb of Sol. Kargoth had already fallen under the thrall of Demogorgon, soured by not being appointed to the head of the knighthood. The fourteen traitors were transformed into the first Death Knights when Kargoth’s blasphemous rites forged a vile imitation of the Orb and unleashed a monstrous spawn of the Prince of Demons. Though the loyal Knight Protectors stemmed its march toward Rauxes, they arrived too late to save the royal family at Carnifand and suffered terrible losses from which the order would never fully recover. Two centuries later the knights opposed the wicked Naelax Overkings and their rise to power through means of assassination. In turn the Overkings decreed that members of the knighthood were enemies of the crown to be hunted down and destroyed. A few Knight Protectors still hold their posts in Almor, Ratik and Knurl of the Bone March, while others secretly wander the marchlands of Ahlissa or fight alongside the bold rebels of the Grandwood and Adri Forests. Knights of Luna The Knights of Luna are an elven order devoted to preserving the monarchy of Celene and upholding the noble traditions of elven communities throughout the central Flanaess. They champion values that promote elven leadership in the cause of good, and believe in noblesse oblige toward allied kin and other species. Currently, the order is at odds with the isolationist policies of the fey Queen and her councillors. The order includes around two hundred knights, primarily based in Celene, though they have an increasing presence in the Duchy of Ulek and a smaller group among the elves of Highfolk. While there is no formal alliance between the Knights of Luna and the Knights of the Hart, the two groups occasionally support each other. Both see Iuz as the greatest threat to good in the Flanaess, though the Knights of Luna are also committed to fighting the monstrous forces of the Pomarj. Mouqollad Consortium The Mouqollad unites the numerous merchant clans of the western realms into a powerful mercantile consortium. In populous regions like Ket, each major town’s bazaar is overseen by a specific merchant clan, which is responsible for maintaining order and security in the marketplace. In return, the clan controls the allocation of space and collects fees from individual traders. In less populated or poorer areas, merchant clans oversee larger territories delegating some responsibilities as needed. Control over specialised trades is also assigned to specific houses-for example, the trade in Ekbiri woollens or gems from Zeif is handled by designated merchant houses, while the sale of authentic magic items is restricted to merchants who pass rigorous qualifying exams. Of course, black markets thrive in some areas (especially Ull), but Mouqollad agents actively hunt down these illicit operations and their patrons. The consortium employs a select force of agents to safeguard its interests in all major western cities. While it maintains an appearance of neutrality in political and military matters, the Mouqollad discreetly works to secure influence at all levels of government, It also polices its own constituent clans and house to ensure compliance with its rules. The Mouqollad has few enemies, but no true allies either. The rulers of Zeif, Tusmit, Ekbir, and Ket tolerate the consortium. In Ull, however, rulers are just as likely to seize goods as buy them, leading to frequent conflicts. Among the Paynim merchants face the same risks as other travellers, such as raids. Piracy in the Gulf of Ghayar and the Dramidj Ocean also threatens Mouqollad ships. While the consortium occasionally wages small-scale wars against pirates, it prefers to manipulate rival pirate groups against each other when possible. Rangers of the Gnarley Forest The rangers of the Gnarley Forest number around 200, with most being native wood folk and a few half-elves among them. The rangers operate democratically, with no single leader issuing orders. Instead, seven Ranger Knights meet at Corustaith every few months at the Gilded Acorn to exchange information. Each Knight has a following of younger rangers who pledge personal allegiance to him or her. In return, each Knight provides training and hosts an annual Brewfest feast for their juniors. This oath emphasises protecting the forest’s integrity, aiding good folk in need, and revering a benevolent deity (typically Ehlonna). Ranger Knights do not have designated territories, though each focuses their efforts in a particular area, often overlapping with others. The rangers prioritise uniting good folk, enjoying strong ties with gnomes, most wood folk, and the swanmays and werebears of the Gnarley. They are more reserved with elves, treating them with respect but a cautious distance. Focused on the forest’s welfare rather than politics, the Gnarley Rangers avoid involvement in the territorial disputes between Dyvers and Greyhawk. They wish for a reduction in Celene’s influence but do not see Greyhawk as a paragon of virtue. However, they appreciate the Greyhawk miilitia’s support in protecting woodsmen, and friendships between rangers and militia leaders have begun to grow. Seekers of the Arcane The Seekers are an informal organization of treasure hunters, scholars, and explorers, operating throughout the Flanaess and beyond. They search the world for artifacts, magic, and treasure. Members range from unscrupulous and self-centered tomb-robbers to high-minded explorers searching for lost knowledge. The Seekers were founded in the early 300s CY to provide a new purpose for the royal explorers and surveyors of the Great Kingdom who were lacking such with the end of its expansionist phase. The Seekers have lodges, usually secret, in cities including Gradsul, the Free City of Greyhawk, Irongate, Rel Astra, and Sasserine. The Seekers sometimes come into conflict with the Silent Ones on their searches. Silent Ones The Silent Ones are an ancient order of wizards in the Sheldomar Valley, based in the Kingdom of Keoland. They were founded by Suel mages fleeing the destruction of the Suel Imperium to protect their secrets including from the Oeridians also migrating to their new home. In time they also dedicated themselves to hide all remnants of Vecna and his empire. The Silent Ones regulated the learning and use of magic in Keoland, and practicing mages had to be members. This control only ended three centuries ago under Tavish the Great, who also founded a rival academy of wizardry in the capital. Since then their political power has been marginalized, but they continue to operate to sanction rogue mages, secure dangerous artefacts, and protect their secrets.

Thieves’ Guild of Greyhawk The Greyhawk Thieves’ Guild has woven itself into the myths and legends of the Flanaess. Around campfires and in taverns across the continent, it is spoken of as the very embodiment of stealth, cunning, and unparalleled skill in thievery. The city of Greyhawk itself has earned a reputation as a den of thieves, with innkeepers and tavern-keepers far and wide warning travelers with tales of the guild’s ruthlessness and the almost supernatural ability of its members to separate people from their wealth. While thievery remains a key activity of the guild, it is less common than most imagine. The Thieves’ Guild favors “victimless” crimes like gambling, loan sharking, brothels, smuggling and counterfeiting, with any physical crimes targeting outsiders-merchants and adventurers-over local residents, especially those who belong to the city’s more powerful or influential guilds. For instance, strict quotas dictate how much can be taken from the Merchants and Traders’ Union each month, and the possessions of the Greyhawk Guild of Wizardry are generally off-limits (for good reason). Non-union traders, however, are fair game, and adventurers offer particularly lucrative opportunities. That said, the Thieves’ Guild does steal from locals whenever possible, though the city’s average residents often have little worth taking. The fear of robbery allows the guild to extort protection money from small businesses and middle-class households, supplementing its substantial income. The guild is organized into sections corresponding to each quarter of the city, and members typically remain within their assigned quarters. Transfers are rare, though members may be temporarily reassigned for joint operations. The Thieves’ Quarter is an exception; a significant number of guild members here are apprentice thieves who move to other quarters once they complete their training. A Master Thief coordinates activities in each quarter, and these Masters make up the guild’s Directorship, which meets regularly in the Thieves Guildhall basement. (The title “Master” is honorary and does not necessarily indicate a specific level of experience). 68 69 Chapter 7: Greyspace - Chapter 7: Greyspace - Oerth’s Wildspace Oerth’s Wildspace System System About Greyhawk and Spelljammer The Foreword of this Gazetteer explains how the current 2024 DMG version of Greyhawk differs in some ways from earlier material. Here is a brief summary of Spelljammer for D&D and how the 2022 version of Spelljammer differs in some ways from the original version of Spelljammer, published between 1989 and 1993. Where the 5th edition version of the D&D Multiverse surrounds Oerth with a wildspace system and links that to other wildspace systems via the astral sea, the original 2nd edition version of the D&D Multiverse has Oerth’s planetary system inside a crystal sphere and phlogiston surrounding the sphere and separating it from other crystal spheres. In that earlier model both wildspace and the phlogiston are part of the Prime Material Plane. No 5th edition version of Greyspace has been published by Wizards of the Coast yet, so this section describes how the original 69 version of Greyspace works. Spelljammer renamed Oerth’s moons (the original Greyhawk names are given in brackets). You can easily use the old material about the worlds of Greyspace as a wildspace system if you so choose. Summary of Greyspace Greyspace is a geocentric wildspace system (crystal sphere), with Oerth at the centre and moons, a sun and the other worlds orbiting it. A notable thing about Greyspace is the Grinder, a gigantic shell of asteroids that separates the Oerth, its moons and its sun from the rest of the planets. On Oerth the visible planets in the night’s sky are referred to as “wanderers”. Celestial Body Type Distance from Oerth Travel time (via spelljammer) Oerth Spherical earth body n/a n/a Celene (Kule) Spherical moon 10 million miles 2 hours Luna (Raenei) Spherical moon 30 million miles 7 hours Liga (The Sun) Spherical fire body 100 million miles 1 day The Grinder Shell of asteroids 200 million miles 2 days Edil Spherical air body 400 million miles 4 days Gnibile Spherical air body 600 million miles 6 days Conatha Elliptical water body 1,000 million miles 10 days Ginsel Crescent- shaped earth body 1,500 million miles 15 days Borka Earth cluster 2,000 million miles 20 days Greela Earth cluster 3,000 million miles 30 days The Spectre Earth flatworld 4,000 million miles 40 days 70 Celestial Bodies of Greyspace Note that all the following celestial bodies are spherical earth bodies, unless stated otherwise. •	Oerth: This is the world at the heart of Greyspace. It appears to be bluish from wildspace. •	Kule (Celene): Oerth’s first moon has no air on its surface, but there are people living in Kule’s Underdark. It has a faint aquamarine hue when viewed from afar. A spelljamming ship from Oerth can get there in two hours. •	Raenei (Luna): Oerth’s second moon has a thin atmosphere. No native sentient people live there, but there are large numbers of monsters on the world. From Oerth it is covered in blue and white streaks. •	Liga: Oerth’s sun has a deep golden glow. Efreet are said to live on the surface of this sun. Liga has a tiny tidally locked moon, called the Moth. •	The Grinder: One of the most unusual celestial bodies in the D&D Multiverse, the Grinder is made up of a sphere of countless millions of asteroids in the same orbit, but travelling in different directions. Individual asteroids are probably not visible with the naked eye from Oerth. Some of the larger Grinder asteroids are inhabited by various groups of spacefarers. •	Edill: This is a gas giant and has a robin’s egg blue color. Dragons live on the moon and have a spelljamming port, called Skyhaven on one of the rocks that orbits within Edill’s atmosphere. •	Gnibile: Superficially this sister world to Edill is similar, but the entire gas giant has been taken over by undead. Gnibile is a baleful red color from space. These undead are said to be trying to lure in spacefarers, to steal their ships. •	Conantha: This is an elliptical water world, with a pair of spherical earth bodies that orbit within it and distort its shape. Sahuagin, mermen and other aquatic creatures live in the world-sea. •	Ginsel: Ginsel has a number of civilisations that are not too dissimilar to those in the Flanaess and other parts of Oerth, but the world itself is a crescent shape, as if it used to be a sphere and a god took a bite out of the world. •	Borka: Borka is one of Greyspace’s two cluster-worlds, made up of a number of asteroids that share a common atmosphere. It is said to have originally been a spherical world that was blown up using god-like powers during the First Unhuman War. Various humanoid survivors of the destruction live on the asteroids. •	Greela: This is Greyspace’s second cluster world and also a common atmosphere. The inhabitants of different asteroids are mostly human, but some other races, like elves also live here. A few giants and giant-kin also live here. •	The Spectre: The Spectre is also called “the Wink” as it is a flat-world and appears to “wink” when viewed from wildspace. There are no sentient beings native to the Spectre, but a number of spacefarers from Greyspace and beyond have colonised parts of both sides of this flatworld. •	Celene orbits Oerth exactly four times per year, and Luna orbits Oerth every twenty-eight days. Neither Borka nor the Spectre are visible with the naked eye. The Twelve Lairs of the Zodiac Of all the constellations that form the edge of Greyspace, the Twelve Lairs are the ones studied most from Oerth. From the surface of Oerth the sun (Liga) passes through these twelve constellations exactly once per year, making the constellations into something that can be used for measuring the passage of the year, as well as something used for navigation. The Twelve Lairs are divided into four groups of three constellations. And each group has a small gap between it and the next group. Each gap in the Lairs is accompanied by a short festival. •	Following Needfest: The first three constellations of the year are Tiger, Bear and Lion. •	Following Growfest: The second group of constellations consists of Frog, Turtle and Fox. •	Following Richfest: The next group are the constellations Snake Boar and Squirrel. •	Following Brewfest: The final three lairs are Hare, Hawk and Wolf. All of the stars of Greyspace take the form of gigantic gemstones. Each gemstone is extremely hot. So far no ship has been able to touch the surface of a star without being destroyed in the attempt.

This is the era in which the “classic” D&D adventure modules are set. Greyhawk Wars Era (582-585 CY): This is the period depicted in the Greyhawk Wars and From the Ashes boxed sets, and in sourcebooks such as Iuz the Evil, The Marklands, and Ivid the Undying. During these years the Flanaess is wracked by a series of conflicts known collectively as the Greyhawk Wars. Renewal Era (586-591+ CY): This is the period depicted in the Greyhawk Wars and From the Ashes boxed sets, and in The Adventure Begins, The Player’s Guide to Greyhawk, and the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer. During this period the Flanaess recover from the Greyhawk Wars. 5e Continuity (576 CY): The D&D Fifth Edition publications - including Ghosts of Saltmarsh and DMG 2024 - have returned to the Classic Era of 576 CY. However, Wizards of the Coast has indicated it does not regard itself as bound by earlier material meaning there is the potential if not certainty of contradiction between material from the different eras. Publications noted “Keystone” below are considered fundamental to the lore of the Greyhawk setting, and provide extensive material about the Flanaess as a whole. DMs looking to research the setting in detail should focus on these publications.

These are WG7 - Castle Greyhawk, WG9 - Gargoyles, WG10 - Child’s Play, WG11 - Puppets, all from the Classic Era, and LT 3 - The Doomgrinder from the Renewal Era. Dragon and Dungeon Magazines ran many features detailing aspects of and adventures within the World of Greyhawk. The full index of Dragon articles has been compiled online at the DragonDex. Richard Di Ioia has complied a spreadsheet of all Dungeon adventures on the Canonfire Greyhawk fan site. The full article from Paul Looby at his blog above provides a full list of those magazine articles relating to Greyhawk. It has not been included here for reasons of space.

Most novels set in the World of Greyhawk - including the two “Gord the Rogue” books written by Gary Gygax and published by TSR (Saga of Old City and Artifact of Evil) - differ from other published sources for various details. Certain non- contradictory details and characters from these books - for example the Catlord, Evaleigh of Knurl, and Deirdre Longland - have been incorporated into later published sources. The five Gord books published by Gygax outside TSR contain details of the World of Greyhawk but use different names for reasons of intellectual property, and are generally considered not to be fully canonical. Some novels, particularly the Mika Oba series by Rose Estes (Master Wolf, The Price of Power, The Demon Hand, The Name of the Game and The Eyes Have It), differ sufficiently from other published material that they are widely regarded as apocryphal. The D&D Iconic Series, released with 3rd edition, is considered apocryphal despite referring to Greyhawk gods such as Pelor and Nerull. 80 Appendix H: Fan Appendix H: Fan Community Resources Community Resources A list of some example community resources that are helpful for additional information on the World of Greyhawk is provided.
